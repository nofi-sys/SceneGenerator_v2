He rode forward to meet them, lifting his broad hat, and reining up
when near enough.  He did this in a beautifully urbane fashion, that
showed he had quite as much respect for himself as for his employers.
He was indeed a handsome fellow, and his rough Garibaldian costume
fitted him, and set him out as if he had been some great actor.

"This is an awkward business," he began, with an easy smile; "but I
think we'll soon catch the runaways up."

"I hope so," Bob said.

"Oh, it was all my fault, because I'm boss of my gang, you know.  I
ought to have known better, but a small mob of stray beasts got among
ours, and by-and-by there was a stampede.  It was dirty-dark last
night, and looked like a storm, so there wouldn't have been an ounce
of use in following them up."

He flicked his long whip half saucily, half angrily, as he spoke.

"Well, never mind," Bob replied, "we'll have better luck next, I've
no doubt."

Away they went now at a swinging trot, and on crossing the creek they
met Craig's fellows.

They laid their horses harder at it now, Bob and Archie keeping a bit
in the rear, though the latter declared that Tell was pulling like a
young steam-engine.

"Why," cried Archie at last, "this beast means to pull my arms out at
the shoulders.  I always thought I knew how to hold the reins till
now."

"They have a queer way with them, those bush-ranging horses," said
Bob; "but I reckon you'll get up to them at last."

"If I were to give Tell his head, he would soon be in the van."

"In the van?  Oh, I see, in the front!"

"Yes; and then I'd be lost.  Why these chaps appear to know every
inch of the ground.  To me it is simply marvellous."

"Well, the trees are blazed."

"I've seen no blazed trees.  Have you?"

"Never a one.  I say, Craig."

"Hullo!" cried the head stockman, glancing over his shoulder.

"Are you steering by blazed trees?"

"No," he laughed; "by tracks.  Cattle don't mind blazed trees much."

Perhaps Bob felt green now, for he said no more.  Archie looked about
him, but never a trail nor track could he decipher.

Yet on they rode, helter-skelter apparently, but cautiously enough
for all that.  Tell was full of fire and fun; for, like Verdant
Green's horse, when put at a tiny tree trunk in his way, he took a
leap that would have carried him over a five-bar-gate.

There was many a storm-felled tree in the way also and many a dead
trunk, half buried in ferns; there were steep stone-clad hills,
difficult to climb, but worse to descend, and many a little rivulet
to cross; but nothing coidd interfere with the progress of these
hardy horses.

Although the sun was blazing hot, no one seemed to feel it much.  The
landscape was very wild, and very beautiful; but Archie got weary at
last of its very loveliness, and was not one whit sorry when the
afternoon halt was called under the pleasant shade of trees, and
close by the banks of a rippling stream.

The horses were glad to drink as well as the men, then they were
hobbled, and allowed to browse while all hands sat down to eat.

Only damper and beef, washed down by a billyful of the clear water,
which, strange to say, was wonderfully cool.

When the sun was sinking low on the forest-clad horizon, there was a
joyful but half-suppressed shout from Craig and his men.  Part of the
herd was in sight, quietly browsing up a creek.

Gentleman Craig pointed them out to Archie; but he had to gaze a
considerable time before he could really distinguish anything that
had the faintest resemblance to cattle.

"Your eye is young yet to the Bush," said Craig, laughing, but not in
any unmannerly way.
