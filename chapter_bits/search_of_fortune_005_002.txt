Kate was a staunch believer in ghosts, goblins, fairies, kelpies,
brownies, spunkies, and all the rest of the supernatural family; and
I have something to relate in connection with this, though it is not
altogether to the credit of my hero, Archie.

Old Kate and young Peter were frequent visitors to the room in the
tower, for the tea Archie made, and the fires he kept on, were both
most excellent in their way.

"Boys will be boys," and Archie was a little inclined to practical
joking.  It made him laugh, so he said, and laughing made one fat.

It happened that, one dark winter's evening, old Kate was invited up
into the tower, and Branson with Peter came also.  Archie volunteered
a song, and Branson played many a fine old air on his fiddle, so that
the first part of the evening passed away pleasantly and even merrily
enough.  Old Kate drank cup after cup of tea as she sat in that weird
old chair, and, by-and-by, Archie, the naughty boy that he was, led
the conversation round to ghosts.  The ancient dame was in her
element now; she launched forth into story after story, and each was
more hair-stirring than its predecessor.

Elsie and Archie occupied their favourite place on a bear's skin in
front of the low fire; and while Kate still droned on, and Branson
listened with eyes and mouth wide open, the boy might have been
noticed to stoop down, and whisper something in his sister's ear.

Almost immediately after a rattling of chains could be heard in one
of the turrets.  Both Kate and Branson started, and the former could
not be prevailed upon to resume her story till Archie lit a candle
and walked all round the room, drawing back the turret curtains to
show no one was there.

Once again old Kate began, and once again chains were heard to
rattle, and a still more awesome sound followed--a long, low,
deep-bass groan, while at the same time, strange to say, the candle
in Archie's hand burnt blue.  To add to the fearsomeness of the
situation, while the chain continued to rattle, and the groaning now
and then, there was a very appreciable odour of sulphur in the
apartment.  This was the climax.  Old Kate screamed, and the big
keeper, Branson, fell on his knees in terror.  Even Elsie, though she
had an inkling of what was to happen, began to feel afraid.

"There now, granny," cried Archie, having carried the joke far
enough, "here is the groaning ghost."  As he spoke he produced a pair
of kitchen bellows, with a musical reed in the pipe, which he
proceeded to sound in old Kate's very face, looking a very
mischievous imp while he did so.

"Oh," said old Kate, "what a scare the laddie has given me.  But the
chain?"

Archie pulled a string, and the chain rattled again.

"And the candle?  That was na canny."

"A dust of sulphur in the wick, granny."

Big Branson looked ashamed of himself, and old Kate herself began to
smile once more.

"But how could ye hae the heart to scare an old wife sae, Master
Archie?"

"Oh, granny, we got up the fun just to show you there were no such
things as ghosts.  Rupert says--and he should know, because he's
always reading--that ghosts are always rats or something."

"Ye maunna frichten me again, laddie.  Will ye promise?"

"Yes, granny, there's my hand on it.  Now sit down and have another
cup of tea, and Elsie will play and sing."

Elsie could sing now, and sweet young voice she had, that seemed to
carry you to happier lands.  Branson always said it made him feel a
boy again, wandering through the woods in summer, or chasing the
butterflies over flowery beds.

And so, albeit Archie had carried his practical joke out to his own
satisfaction, if not to that of every one else, this evening, like
many others that had come before it, and came after it, passed away
pleasantly enough.

It was in the spring of the same year, and during the Easter
holidays, that a little London boy came down to reside with his aunt,
who lived in one of Archie's father's cottages.

Young Harry Brown had been sent to the country for the express
purpose of enjoying himself, and set about this business forthwith.
He made up to Archie; in fact, he took so many liberties, and talked
to him so glibly, and with so little respect, that, although Archie
had imbued much of his father's principles as regards liberalism, he
did not half like it.
