Now the fairy scene is changed.  Archie is on shore.  It is the
forenoon of another day, and the sun is warm though not uncomfortably
hot.  There is so much that is bracing and invigorating in the very
air, that he longs to be doing something at once.  Longs to commence
laying the foundation-stone of that temple of fortune which--let
Captain Vesey say what he likes--he, Archie Broadbent, is bent upon
building.

He has dressed himself in his very English best.  His clothes are new
and creaseless, his gloves are spotless, his black silk hat
immaculate, the cambric handkerchief that peeps coyly from his
breast-pocket is whiter than the snow, his boots fit like gloves, and
shine as softly black as his hat itself, and his cane even must be
the envy of every young man he meets.

Strange to say, however, no one appears to take a very great deal of
notice of him, though, as he glances towards the shop-windows, he can
see as if in a mirror that one or two passengers have looked back and
smiled.  But it couldn't surely have been at him?  Impossible!

The people, however, are apparently all very active and very busy,
though cool, with a self-possession that he cannot help envying, and
which he tries to imitate without any marked degree of success.

There is an air of luxury and refinement about many of the buildings
that quite impresses the young man, but he cannot help noticing that
there is also a sort of business air about the streets which he
hardly expected to find, and which reminds him forcibly of Glasgow
and Manchester.  He almost wishes it had been otherwise.

He marches on boldly enough.

Archie feels as if on a prospecting tour--prospecting for gold.  Of
course he is going to make his fortune, but how is he going to begin?
That is the awkward part of the business.  If he could once get in
the thin end of the wedge he would quickly drive it home.

"There is nothing like ambition
If we steer a steady course."


Of course there isn't.  But staring into a china-shop window will do
him little good.  I do not believe he saw anything in that window
however.  Only, on turning away from it, his foot goes splash into a
pool of dirty water on the pavement, or rather on what ought to be a
pavement.  That boot is ruined for the day, and this reminds him that
Sydney streets are not paved with gold, but with very unromantic
matter-of-fact mud.  Happy thought! he will dine.

The waiters are very polite, but not obsequious, and he makes a
hearty meal, and feels more at home.

Shall he tip this waiter fellow?  Is it the correct thing to tip
waiters?  Will the waiter think him green if he does, or green if he
doesn't?

These questions, trifling though they may appear, really annoyed
Archie; but he erred on the right side, and did tip the waiter--well
too.  And the waiter brightened up, and asked him if he would like to
see a playbill.

Then this reminded Archie that he might as well call on some of the
people to whom he had introductions.  So he pulled out a small bundle
of letters, and he asked the waiter where this, that, and t'other
street was; and the waiter brought a map, and gave him so many hints,
that when he found himself on the street again he did not feel half
so foreign.  He had something to do now, something in view.  Besides
he had dined.

"Yes, he'd better drive," he said to himself, "it would look better."
He lifted a finger, and a hansom rattled along, and drew up by the
kerb.  He had not expected to find cabs in Sydney.  His card-case was
handy, and his first letter also.

He might have taken a 'bus or tram.  There were plenty passing, and
very like Glasgow 'buses they were too; from the John with the
ribbons to the cad at the rear.  But a hansom certainly looked more
aristocratic.  Aristocratic?  Yes.  But were there any aristocrats in
Sydney?  Was there any real blue blood in the place?  He had not
answered those questions to his satisfaction, when the hansom stopped
so suddenly that he fell forward.

"Wait," he said to the driver haughtily.

"Certainly, sir."

Archie did not observe, however, the grimace the Jehu made to another
cabman, as he pointed over his shoulder with his thumb, else he would
hardly have been pleased.
