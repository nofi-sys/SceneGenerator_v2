- Bill: a tough, gruff man who doesn't show his emotions. He's been through a lot and has a rough exterior.
- The old gentleman: a dignified older man, presumably the girl's father.
- The doctor: a stern, scientific man who is all business.
- Miss Mayhew: the girl who was saved by Bill's blood transfusion. She is kind and sweet, with a soft light in her eyes.

The literary style of this scene is lighthearted and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person omniscient.

Bill has just awakened from a coma, and the first thing he sees is the black kitten he hates. The kitten is nestled on his chest, and he angrily brushes it off. The kitten belongs to the girl he saved with his blood, and she is now rosy and healthy. The father tells them that the girl has gone crazy several times at the sight of a cat. The doctor appears and tells them that Bill must have given her a lot of blood. The girl picks up the kitten and smiles at Bill, who is now feeling resentful toward the cat.
