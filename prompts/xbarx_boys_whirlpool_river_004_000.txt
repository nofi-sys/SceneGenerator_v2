The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator. The tone is somewhat ominous, as Pop Burns seems to be foreshadowing some sort of trouble for The Pup.

1. Gus Tripp: the storm center, drawling speech, eyes that grow languid near Norine
2. Joe Marino (The Pup): never became a part of the ranch, lone drinker, now dragging another boy down with him
3. Pop Burns: old puncher, denounces The Pup, friends with Gus
4. Teddy: son of Pop Burns, filling a can of flour, listening to Pop's story

-Gus Tripp leaves the X Bar X ranch
-Joe Marino, aka The Pup, is also leaving because he shirks his job
-Pop Burns talks to The Pup before he leaves
-Teddy is packing a can of flour and thinking about Pop's prophecy
