The scene opens with the protagonist and his fellow soldiers approaching Escondido Bay on the outskirts of the Reservation. A plane picks them up and flies them back to Guantanamo. As they approach, they can see many planes in the sky and the bay is full of activity. They are met by the Admiral's staff officer who places them under arrest and takes them to the Admiral's quarters. The protagonist is asked to prepare a report of their experiences. He does so, and it is circulated among the troops. The next day, they receive news that new A-bomb experiments are being conducted in the Kalahari Desert. The report mentions that some fear was expressed that there were traitors among the technicians. The protagonist realizes that the Shadow Men must have infiltrated the bombproof and killed Yount. He is scared stiff at the thought.
