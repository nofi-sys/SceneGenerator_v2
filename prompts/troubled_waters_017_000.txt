-The girl is trembling, with a fast pulse, as she enters the jailer's shadow. She looks tired and worn, with none of the youthfulness or sweetness that Rowan remembers. It is clear that he has ruined her life.
-Rowan looks tired and gaunt. His impulse is to comfort the girl, but he does not dare. He knows that she has come as a judge, not a lover.
-The girl is angry and accusing. She demands that Rowan tell her he is innocent, but he cannot. She is hurt and betrayed that he will not even deny the charges against him.

The purpose of this scene is to show the protagonist, Rowan, being confronted by his girlfriend about the murder charges against him. The author achieves this goal by having the girlfriend question him directly about his innocence and then express her disbelief when he cannot give her a straight answer.

The girl in the shadow of the cell is accused of a crime she did not commit. The man in the cell cannot tell her the truth and she cannot trust him.
