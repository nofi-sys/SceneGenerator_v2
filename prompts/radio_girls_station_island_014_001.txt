The scene opens with two girls, Amy and Jessie, sitting at a spring in the woods. They are joined by two other girls, Belle and Sally, who are considered unpleasant by Amy and Jessie. Belle and Sally are absurdly dressed for an outing in the woods, and Belle immediately begins to make fun of Henrietta, a freckle-faced girl who is also present. Henrietta stoutly defends herself and the spring, declaring that it is on her land and that the girls from the hotel will not be allowed to drink from it. Belle and Sally begin to walk toward the spring, but Henrietta stops them, smearing dirt on Belle's dress. Belle threatens to have Henrietta whipped, but Jessie intervenes, scolding Henrietta for her behavior. Jessie tries to reason with Henrietta, explaining that Belle and Sally are not worth getting so worked up over. Henrietta eventually calms down, and the scene ends with Jessie trying to console her.

The style of this scene is light and humorous. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is playful.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two groups of girls and to show how Jessie tries to resolve it. Jessie is angry with Henrietta for her rudeness, but she also tries to understand her point of view. This shows that Jessie is a fair and reasonable person, which will make the reader root for her in the conflict.
