The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by having the characters interact with each other.

A waiter tells the protagonist that he is wanted in the foyer, where he finds two ladies in a carriage. He recognizes one as Rosa, but she is greatly changed from the last time he saw her. The ladies invite him to spend the afternoon with them, and he agrees. As they drive through the city, they pass a park and the market pier, where a group of people recognize the ladies' liveries and cry out their support for the "Whites." Rosa and her mother do not acknowledge them.

The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of polite detachment.
