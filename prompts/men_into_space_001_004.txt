The scene opens with the protagonist, McCauley, preparing for takeoff in a rocket ship. He and his co-pilot, Furness, are under a lot of pressure to perform well on this mission. The ship takes off and McCauley is immediately slammed back into his chair by the force of the acceleration. He endures this for several seconds until the jatos burn out and the ship starts to level off. He then begins to assess their situation and make sure everything is functioning normally. However, he notices that Furness seems to be in a daze, and his voice has a strange note to it. McCauley continues to focus on the task at hand, flying the ship and making sure it stays on course. As they reach the limit of the ramjets' power, they begin to switch over to the rocket engines. This is when things start to go wrong. The ship starts to lose altitude and McCauley can't seem to get it under control. They end up crash landing in a field, and McCauley is knocked unconscious.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a focus on the details of the take-off. The point of view is limited third person, from the perspective of McCauley. There is a lot of technical language used to describe the ship and the take-off process.
