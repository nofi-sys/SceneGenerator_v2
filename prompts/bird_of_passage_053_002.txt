The style of this scene is rather formal and stilted, possibly due to the fact that the two characters are cousins and are not particularly close. The tone is somewhat gossipy and lighthearted, and the point of view is third person limited.

- Helen tells her cousin about the night she spent with Gilbert Lisle on the island
- They discuss whether or not he could be the real Gilbert Lisle
- Dido is convinced he is not, and that he is instead an impostor
- Helen is sure he is the real Gilbert Lisle, based on what she knows about him

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the true identity of the man that Helen thought she was in love with. The author achieves this goal by having the characters discuss the man's background and history.
