The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two main characters, George and Annie. George is interested in Annie, but is not sure if she feels the same way. He plans to pursue her, but is interrupted by Joan.

- Annie Lane is a governess who is secretly in love with one of her pupils, George Braithwaite. 
- George is a wealthy man who is known for being a bit of a playboy. 
- Joan, another one of Annie's pupils, tells her that George is getting married to a wealthy woman. 
- Annie is heartbroken and humiliated, feeling like she has been used by both George and Joan.

The literary style of this scene is one of bitter irony. The narrator tells the story from the point of view of Annie Lane, the governess, who has just been rejected by George Braithwaite. The tone is one of anger and resentment towards the Braithwaite brothers, who have both led her on and then rejected her.
