A stranger approaches Rob Fraser, who is lying on the bank of a stream, and strikes up a conversation with him. The stranger is a very affable man, and tells Rob that he remembers when he was young and used to catch fish in the stream. The stranger then asks Rob if he thinks the old days were better than the present. Rob is eager to know more, and the stranger tells him that the old days were fine, but that there is a tune he remembers that is even better. The stranger then takes out a reed instrument and plays a tune for Rob. The stranger tells Rob that he makes tunes like this all day long. Rob is fascinated and asks the stranger what else he can do. The stranger tells him that he can hear the owl passing over the brae in the night, see the stag hunkered amongst the crags, and catch the otter at his play. The stranger then asks Rob if he can call the weasel from his hole.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of the stranger, and to establish his magical abilities. The author achieves this by having the stranger talk about his ability to make music, and then demonstrating his ability to call an animal from its hiding place.
