The scene opens with the protagonist, Julian 9th, being arrested by the Kash Guard and taken to the headquarters of the teivos (a local government body). There, he is met by Brother Or-tis, the head of the teivos, and a group of other men. Julian realizes that he is being tried by a special military tribunal, and wonders what he could have done to warrant such treatment. 
Soor, an officer of the law, states the charges against Julian: resisting arrest and assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon. Julian is shocked, as he doesn't remember doing either of these things. He is about to speak in his defense when Or-tis cuts him off, telling him that he will be given a chance to speak later. 
Or-tis then asks Soor to recount the events leading up to Julian's arrest. Soor does so, and his story is as follows: he and his men were sent to Julian's district to collect taxes, but were met with resistance from the locals. They were about to leave when Julian appeared and began to incite the crowd against them. Soor and his men tried to arrest Julian, but he resisted and eventually managed to grab one of their guns. He pointed it at Soor and pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired. Soor and his men were able to subdue Julian and take him into custody.
After hearing both sides of the story, the tribunal decides to find Julian guilty of the charges against him. He is sentenced to death, and is led away to be executed.

The style of this scene is very formal. The narrator is third person omniscient, and the tone is very matter-of-fact. There is a sense of foreboding throughout the scene, as the reader knows that Julian is in for a tough time.
