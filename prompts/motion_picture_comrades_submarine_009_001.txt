The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is from Oscar and Ballyhoo's perspective, and the tone is one of caution and curiosity.

Oscar and Ballyhoo are crossing a sandy Key when they hear a noise that sounds like an oar hitting the side of a boat. They creep forward to investigate and see a boat with two men in it. The men have their faces turned toward the island, and Oscar and Ballyhoo worry that they will be discovered.
The men in the boat are rowing and appear to be looking for something. Suddenly, one of the men points and shouts, and the other man starts rowing toward the island. Oscar and Ballyhoo duck down behind some bushes to avoid being seen.
The men beach the boat and start walking toward the island. As they get closer, Oscar and Ballyhoo can see that they are both carrying rifles. The men are walking quickly and purposefully, and Oscar and Ballyhoo are worried that they might be dangerous.
Oscar and Ballyhoo follow the men from a safe distance, and eventually the men stop and start digging in the sand. It looks like they are looking for something. After a few minutes, one of the men finds something and starts to dig it out. It looks like a small box.
The men open the box and start to look through its contents. Oscar and Ballyhoo are too far away to see what is in the box, but they can tell that the men are excited about whatever they have found. The men put the box back in the ground and start to cover it up again.
Once the men have finished burying the box, they get back in their boat and start to row away. Oscar and Ballyhoo wait until they are gone before they come out of hiding.
Oscar and Ballyhoo discuss what they have just seen, and they both agree that it was probably pirates who buried the box. They decide to go back to the beach and see if they can find the box.
After a few minutes of digging, they find the box. They open it and find a treasure map. They are excited to have found the pirates' treasure, and they start to make plans to go back to the mainland and get some help to dig up the treasure.
