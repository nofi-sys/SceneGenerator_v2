- Madame Torialli rose and crossed the room to a tiny shrine on her desk, inside of which was a photograph of her husband.
- She expressed her love for him and her pride in his accomplishments, and then returned to the topic of Jean's actress friend.
- Jean was uneasy when Madame Torialli mentioned a "nice young grocer round the corner" that Margot would eventually marry.
- Madame Torialli advised Jean to stop seeing Margot altogether, and he reluctantly agreed.
- They laughed together about the situation, and then Madame Torialli ended the conversation.

The style of this scene is formal and slightly stilted. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is somewhat detached. There is a sense of irony in the way Madame Torialli is able to see the situation for what it is, while Jean is still caught up in the emotion of it.

-Madame Torialli: an older woman, conservative, from a wealthy background
-Jean: a young man, Margot's friend
-Torialli: Madame Torialli's husband, a singer
