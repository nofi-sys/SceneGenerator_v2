The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is threatening.

-Teddy sees the Pup's knife and kicks it to the side
-The Pup tries to talk his way out of the situation, but Teddy is not having it
-Teddy demands to know where the Pup is from
-The Pup tries to deflect, but Teddy is not fooled
-Teddy tells the Pup to leave and never come back

The purpose of this scene is to establish Teddy's character as a tough but fair individual. Teddy could have easily killed Marino when he pulled out his knife, but he didn't. Instead, he disarmed him and then warned him to stay off of their land. This shows that Teddy is not a violent person, but he is not someone to be messed with either.
