-Lieutenant Quentin: commander of the Watson, a torpedo boat
-Topham: a passenger on the Watson, on a mission to find the Southern Cross and bring ashore one of its passengers
-Miss Lillian Byrd: the passenger Topham is looking for, a newspaper woman

The scene opens with the torpedo boat Watson speeding away from Old Point towards the open sea. Topham has just boarded the boat and given the order to head out to sea. The commander of the boat, Lieutenant Quentin, informs Topham that they have been instructed to find the Southern Cross and bring one of its passengers ashore.
Down in the cabin, Topham and Quentin review the chart and discuss their plan of action. They decide that the best way to find the Southern Cross is to try to raise it by wireless. Quentin goes back up to the deck to take charge, while Topham remains in the cabin.
The wireless operator soon picks up a signal from the Southern Cross. Topham sends a message to Quentin, asking him to change course. He then asks the operator to find out if Miss Lillian Byrd is on board the Southern Cross. The operator soon gets a response and informs Topham that Miss Byrd is indeed on board the ship.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is a hint of tension and urgency in the dialogue, but overall the tone is fairly calm. The point of view is third person omniscient.
