The hussar manages to fight him off and shoots him in the shoulder. The prisoner yells, and a group of Indians appear from the woods and capture both the hussar and the prisoner. The Indians strip the hussar of his weapons and handcuff him, then lead him away into the woods. The prisoner, who is apparently the leader of the Indians, remains behind, scowling and muttering to himself. In the distance, the sound of the hussar's horse galloping away and the sound of people coming from the direction of the town can be heard. The leader of the Indians disappears into the woods after his tribe.
