The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a sense of foreboding. The point of view is from Hi's perspective, and the tone is one of anxiety and fear.

- Hi is a young boy who has been helping the rebel army of Don Manuel
- The Meruel Reds are a squadron of soldiers who are preparing broth at a quarry-siding
- Hi slips through the crowd and out of the siding to the road
- He sees the White army in the distance and sets off towards them
- He is stopped by a group of Meruel Reds and wonders if they are on the same side
- He walks boldly on, pretending he knows where he is going
