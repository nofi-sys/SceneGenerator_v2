- John is sitting with David, who is telling him a story
- David's father had a chest with old things in it, and one day when David was feeling particularly lonely, he went to look through it
- He found a coat that must have belonged to one of his grandparents, and in the pocket he found a letter
- The letter was from David's grandfather to his father, telling him that he was setting off on a journey to England to claim something that was rightfully theirs
- David has been trying to figure out what the thing is ever since, and he thinks John might be able to help him

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of drama or suspense, and the tone is almost conversational. The point of view is third person limited, focused on John's perspective.
