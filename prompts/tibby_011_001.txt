The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Mrs. Wylie's rational skepticism and Mrs. Lucien's spiritual belief in the existence of guardian angels. Mrs. Wylie believes that any phenomenon that can be explained by natural causes is not evidence of the supernatural. Mrs. Lucien, on the other hand, is willing to believe in anything, even if it cannot be fully explained. This conflict sets up the tension that will drive the rest of the story.

The literary style of this scene is very formal and serious. The tone is respectful but skeptical, and the point of view is third person limited.

Mrs. Lucien and Mrs. Wylie discuss spiritism and the possibility of communicating with the dead. Mrs. Wylie is skeptical, but Mrs. Lucien tells her about an experience her father had with a spirit photograph. Mrs. Wylie remains skeptical, but is willing to believe in anything rather than spirits.
