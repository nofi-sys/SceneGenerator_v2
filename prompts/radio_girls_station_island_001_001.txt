The scene takes place at the Norwood house, where Shannon has brought Henrietta to tell Amy and Jessie about her invitation to visit her on Station Island. Amy and Jessie are both excited about the prospect of visiting an island with a radio station, and they agree to visit Henrietta there.
However, their excitement is interrupted when they see Bill Brewster's car careening out of control toward the pony that Shannon is sitting on. Amy shrieks in warning, and Brewster manages to swerve the car back onto the road at the last second.
Belle Ringold and Sally Moon, who are passengers in the car, are not happy about the close call. Amy and Jessie are both relieved that the girls are okay, but they can't help feeling that Belle and Sally are to blame for the near-accident.

The style of this scene is light and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person omniscient.
