Dave, a physicist, is in a laboratory with two other physicists, Claverly and Phelps, when he suddenly finds himself unable to see them. He looks around and realizes that he is now a ghost. He tries to communicate with Jane, one of the other physicists, but she cannot see or hear him. He then watches as she and the others walk into the next room, where he sees his own ghostly image. He tries to warn them, but they cannot hear him. Finally, he manages to grab the crystal they are working with and runs outside with it.

The purpose of this scene is to show the reader that Dave is now a ghost, and to establish the conflict that he faces in trying to help his friends from the afterlife.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of the supernatural. The point of view is third person omniscient, and the tone is one of urgency and fear.
