-Moh-goh: A Laythean who befriends Ju-lan and helps him navigate the city. He is a Paladar, or Count.
-Ko-vo: The commander of the guard at the inner opening of the tunnel. He is a Kamadar, or Duke.
-Ju-lan: The protagonist of the story. He is from Earth and is trying to find his way back home.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator telling the story. There is a bit of dialogue between the characters, but mostly it is exposition. The tone is fairly neutral, although there is a sense of suspense as the characters approach the guard at the tunnel.

Ju-lan and Moh-goh are on their way to Laythe, hoping to find refuge there from the Kalkars. They are stopped by the Laythean guard, who are surprised to see anyone coming out of the disused tunnel. Moh-goh explains that they are not Kalkars and tells the story of their escape from City No. 337. The guard commander, Ko-vo, is incredulous but decides to bring them to the city anyway. Ju-lan is given the name Ju-lan-fit by the Laytheans and is treated as a prince.
