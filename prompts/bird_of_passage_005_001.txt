The literary style of this scene is formal and polite. The tone is somewhat gossipy and catty, as the two women discuss the men in the settlement. The point of view is third person limited, as we only know what the two women are thinking and saying.

The scene opens with Miss Caggett trying to engage Helen in conversation in order to glean some negative information about Mr. Quentin that she can share with the other members of the settlement. Helen is uninterested in playing along, and instead admires the view. The General interrupts and invites Helen to look at the islands through his telescope. Helen is hesitant, but agrees. The General points out Havelock island and tells her that they will take her there sometime. Helen is pleased and thanks him.
