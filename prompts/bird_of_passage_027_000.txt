The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Mrs. Creery and to foreshadow the conflict between her and Helen. Mrs. Creery is shown to be a gossipy, judgmental woman who is quick to believe the worst about others. Helen, on the other hand, is shown to be a kind and compassionate person who is willing to give others the benefit of the doubt.

Mrs. Creery is circulating rumors about Mr. Lisle, who she believes is a Captain Lisle, a black sheep who was turned out of a regiment in Bengal. Helen Denis defends Mr. Lisle, saying he is not a reprobate, but Mrs. Creery insists he is and that he will never show his face again.
