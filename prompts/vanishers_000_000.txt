The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the conflict. The author achieves these goals by describing the Marines' preparations for landing, the strange feeling that something unusual is about to happen, and the sudden disappearance of the Caribbean Sea.

- Marines in battle dress debark onto a landing craft in the Caribbean, headed for a half-moon beach.
- Captain Ross Haggerty and First Lieutenant Peter Hoose are in charge of the two other LCVPs.
- The men are equipped with latest in ship-shore-landing-craft-airplane communications.
- As they approach the beach, they are met with dud shells and jets diving overhead.
- The marines disembark and are met with silence.
- They realize they are now in a desert, with no sign of the Caribbean, the Odyssey, or the jets.
