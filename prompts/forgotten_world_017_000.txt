The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of anxiety and worry.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the tension between the characters and to foreshadow the conflict to come. The author achieves this by having the Control Operations officer take pictures of the metal-finding device without permission, which angers the people who have built it.

- Laird Carlin, Jonny, and Ross Floring are in a workshop, discussing a new metal-finding device that Jonny has invented. 
- Floring is interested in the machine, and asks Carlin for his opinion as a CE. 
- Carlin approves of the machine, but Floring is disappointed. 
- Floring takes out a tiny tri-dimen camera and snaps a few pictures of the machine's interior mechanism. 
- Harb Land starts to protest, but it's too late. 
- Floring says he'll keep the films, in case the machine is ever lost. 
- Carlin understands Floring's cleverness. They can't protest the films without giving the real reason for their protest, and that they can't do.
