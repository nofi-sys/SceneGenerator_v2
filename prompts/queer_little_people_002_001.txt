The style of this scene is light-hearted and playful. It is told from the point of view of the children, who are observing the birds. The tone is cheerful and amused.

The children are watching the robins feed their babies and are discussing names for their own birds. Tip-Top is the biggest and strongest bird and is always demanding the most food. His mother scolds him and sometimes makes him wait to eat. Speckle is a smaller bird who pecks at Tip-Top. Brown-Eyes is a meek little bird who is afraid of his brothers. Toddy and Singer are sister birds who chatter a lot. The robins are not a peaceable family as the children had thought. Tip-Top tells his parents that he wants to learn to fly and his father tells him to be patient. Tip-Top is impatient and wants to fly like the swallows.

The purpose of this scene is to show the conflict between Tip-Top and the other birds in the nest. The author achieves this by having Tip-Top be the biggest and strongest bird, and always trying to take more than his share of food. This leads to conflict with the other birds, who try to stand up to him. In the end, the author shows that this conflict is due to Tip-Top's impatience and desire to fly before he is ready.
