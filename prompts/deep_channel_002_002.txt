- Julie is embarrassed and scared that she will have to lead in prayer, as she has never been able to do so before.
- Mrs. Anderson does not take no for an answer, and drags her to prayer meeting against her will.

-Julie: Nervous, averted eyes, frozen silence, mother informed her life, cannot lead in prayer
-Mrs. Anderson: Inexorable, convulsed with mirth, old teeth, large hands
-Brother Seabrook: First prayer-meeting, big man
-Brother Mead: Called on her to pray, old
-Brother Johnston: Called on her to pray, old
-Revivalist: Carried her away, set her free

The style of this scene is very formal and old-fashioned. The dialogue is stiff and formal, and the characters seem to be very proper and well-mannered. There is a sense of tension and unease throughout the scene, as Julie is clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leading the prayer and is trying to find a way to get out of it.
