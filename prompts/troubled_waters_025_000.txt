Ruth is in her sewing room, reading the Wagon Wheel _Spoke_ and thinking about Lawrence Silcott. She recalls how he had been caught betraying his friends, and compares him to Rowan McCoy, who had stood his punishment calmly. She wonders what the difference is between the two men, and concludes that it is character. Suddenly, she hears a noise outside and realizes that someone is on the porch.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is from Ruth's perspective, and the tone is one of anger and contempt.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the contrast between Rowan and Silcott. Ruth sees Silcott as a weak, cowardly man who is not worthy of her respect, while Rowan is a strong, honorable man who is worthy of her love.
