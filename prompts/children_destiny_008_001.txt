The purpose of this scene is to establish Bulstrode as a gossipy, vulgar man with no filter, and to hint at the conflict between Skelton and Blair.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by Bulstrode's candid and direct language. He speaks frankly about his dislike for racing and for the people who are involved in it. He also shows his disdain for Richard Skelton, whom he views as a social climber. Mrs. Blair is portrayed as a timid and na√Øve woman who is easily manipulated by Bulstrode.
