The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Molly and to set up the conflict between her and the village folk. The author achieves this by having the characters discuss Molly's behavior and by showing the contrast between her and the "wooden" respectability of the village folk.

The literary style of this scene is lighthearted and conversational. The tone is playful and teasing, and the point of view is third person limited.

- Michael, John, and Rosamund are sitting in a field discussing the fairies.
- Tony established a cache for Molly in order to reward her for good behaviour.
- The contents of the cache are dependent on her behaviour, and often include flowers or snails.
- If the fairies are displeased, they may put coal or stones in the cache instead.
- John and Rosamund discuss Molly's potential and how she is misunderstood by the village folk.
