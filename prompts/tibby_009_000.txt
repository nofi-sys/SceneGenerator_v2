The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the room in which the seance will take place, and by introducing Mrs. Wylie, who is skeptical of the whole event.

The scene opens with Mrs. Wylie, Mr. Wylie, and Mrs. Lucien discussing a seance that they are about to attend. Mrs. Wylie is skeptical of the event, but goes along to please Mrs. Lucien. 
Upon arrival, they are met by a man who checks their credentials and leads them into a small room where other guests are gathered. The room is dimly lit and there is a small stove in one corner. 
Mrs. Wylie begins to investigate the room, looking for any signs of trickery. She looks under furniture, in corners, and even feels the walls for hidden panels. She finds nothing out of the ordinary. 
The group is then led into the seance room where they are instructed to take a seat. The room is even dimmer than the last, with a single lamp in one corner and a cabinet in the other. There is an antique chair in the middle of the room and a mahogany stand near the windows. 
The seance begins and Mrs. Wylie continues to watch for any signs of trickery. However, she is unable to find anything. The events of the seance unfold and Mrs. Wylie remains skeptical.
