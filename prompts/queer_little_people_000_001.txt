The tone of this scene is lighthearted and humorous. The point of view is third person omniscient.

- Parents of young ducks consult with Dr. Peppercorn about their children's condition
- Dr. Peppercorn prescribes a daily lotion and powder, and warns against wetting their feet or drinking water
- The young ducks ignore the prescriptions and continue to play in the mud and water
- Their condition worsens and they eventually drown
- Mrs. Feathertop faints upon hearing the news
- Dr. Peppercorn calls a council with a young, modern doctor from Paris

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Doctor Peppercorn and to set up the conflict between him and the young ducks. The author achieves this by having the Doctor give a long, detailed explanation of the ducks' condition and then having the ducks disobey his instructions.
