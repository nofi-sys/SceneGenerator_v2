Maida wakes up to the sound of a phonograph playing reveille. She gets out of bed and goes to wake up Rosie, who is also excited for the day ahead. They go to wake up Laura, who is less enthusiastic.
The twelve children sit down to breakfast with Granny Flynn and Mrs. Dore. After breakfast, Maida leads the way to the north side of the house to show the six little children the nicest place for them to play.
They come to a big sloping rock called House Rock. Maida explains that this is the Little Six's playground. There are some toys in the house which they can bring over to play house with. They are not to go far from the rock and when they hear the cow-bell, they must return to the Little House.
Maida then leads the way to a big circular enclosure called the Fairy Ring.
