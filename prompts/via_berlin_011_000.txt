The scene opens with four people walking towards the embassy in Berlin. They are Lord Maxwell, his daughter, Miss Byrd, and Topham. As they walk, Miss Byrd starts to talk about how she has changed in the last few years. She explains that she is now a lady journalist and has been working for the New York Gazette for two years. She says that the job has been hard on her refinement, but that she can still pretend to be refined when she wants to.
Topham is surprised and uncomfortable to hear this, and the two walk on in silence for a while. Eventually, Miss Byrd starts to talk again, this time about her father. She explains that he lost his job in the War Department and then his money in the panic, and that she and her sister had to take care of him. She says that she became a reporter because it was the only job she could find.
The scene ends with Miss Byrd saying that she has been invited to visit Berlin by a friend, and that she is enjoying her time there.

The literary style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is somewhat melancholy.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Lillian Byrd and Walter Topham, and to set up the conflict between them. The author achieves this by having Lillian Byrd reveal her new, more hardened personality to Topham, who is clearly uncomfortable with the change.
