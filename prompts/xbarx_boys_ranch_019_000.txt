In the scene, Roy tells Teddy about his encounter with the rustler Froud and how he believes that the rustler's headquarters is located in Harvers Gully. Teddy is skeptical at first, but after hearing Roy's account, he agrees that it is worth investigating. The two brothers make plans to ride to Harvers Gully to see if they can find any clues to the rustler's whereabouts.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters' goals and to set up the conflict for the rest of the story. The author achieves this by having the characters discuss their plans for finding the rustlers' hideout and catching the criminals.
