Skelton: a magnanimous man
Sylvia: clever, with a fair red mouth
Blair: has a score against Skelton
Lewis Pryor: a boyish figure, holding on to the bottom of a boat in the river

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Skelton and Sylvia, and to foreshadow the conflict that will arise between them over Lewis.

Skelton and Sylvia are sitting in an arbour in the garden when a storm suddenly starts. They see a boat floating downstream with a boy clinging to it. Skelton runs to the boy while Sylvia goes to the house.
