The literary style of this scene is characterized by its intense emotionality and its use of dialogue to reveal the characters' inner thoughts and feelings. The tone is one of despair and grief, and the point of view is that of Henry Hindes, the man who is blamed for the death of Jenny Crampton.

Henry Hindes is kneeling at the grave of his friends, Jenny and her father, when Jenny's husband, Frederick Walcheren, approaches and demands to know what right he has to be there. Hindes replies that he is not aware that the cemetery belongs exclusively to Walcheren and that Walcheren has no right to forbid him from mourning the loss of his friends. Walcheren is angry at the implication that his wife's death was anything other than an accident and accuses Hindes of being behind the inscription on the monument, which implies that there is a doubt about the manner of Jenny's death. Hindes insists that the monument was designed and the inscription written by Jenny's father before he died. Walcheren does not believe him and accuses Hindes of being in all of Jenny's father's confidences and of making a bad use of his knowledge. Hindes is shocked when Walcheren tells him that Jenny said she hated him.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the conflict between Henry Hindes and Frederick Walcheren, and to establish the latter's character as an antagonist. The author also uses the scene to foreshadow the eventual downfall of Hindes.
