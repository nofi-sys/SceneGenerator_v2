Governor McDowell is a cattleman and sympathizes with the Bald Knob raiders. He hopes to find an excuse to parole them, and so he diverges from the direct road to Yellowstone to stop at the Circle Diamond Ranch. On the way, he talks to several old-timers who tell him that the public would be satisfied to see the raiders paroled.
When he arrives at the ranch, he is impressed by Ruth's beauty and gallantry. Mrs. McDowell tells her husband that he must do something for Ruth, and he eventually agrees to parole Rowan McCoy.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Ruth and to show how determined she is to get her husband out of prison. The author also wants to show how the governor is considering public opinion in his decision-making.
