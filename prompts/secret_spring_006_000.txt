The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The point of view is third person omniscient. There is a sense of foreboding and tension throughout, as the reader knows that the protagonist is about to receive some sort of bad news.

The scene opens with the protagonist, a young man, recounting how he has never spent money on a cab in Paris – except for when travelling with luggage. He says that as soon as he received the envelope containing his salary and travel expenses from the Ducal chancery, he took a cab straight to his lodgings in order to open it.
The protagonist is overjoyed to find that he has been given four thousand francs, and decides to pay a visit to M. Thierry – his former tutor – straight away. He finds M. Thierry in his room and tells him that he will be leaving Paris the next day.
M. Thierry congratulates the protagonist on his new position, and advises him to be mindful of Pascal's father's maxim: "Try to keep your pupil ever worthy of his task." He also suggests some books for the protagonist to take with him to Lautenburg, and asks him to consult the Ducal library's catalogue of manuscripts for material on German society in the 17th century.
The protagonist promises to keep M. Thierry's advice in mind, and M. Thierry warns him to be on his guard against Baron von Boose, if he is still at Lautenburg.
