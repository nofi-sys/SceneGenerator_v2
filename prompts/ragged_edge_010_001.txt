The literary style of this scene is characterized by its naturalistic dialogue and its focus on working-class characters. There is a rough, colloquial quality to the language, which gives the scene an authentic feel. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is somewhat tense and suspenseful, as the characters await the arrival of the "chain gang."
