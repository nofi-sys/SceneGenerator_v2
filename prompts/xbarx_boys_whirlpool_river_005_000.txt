The style of this scene is straightforward and simple. There is no fancy language or poetic descriptions. The tone is matter-of-fact and the point of view is third person limited.

- Roy hears Gus Tripp and Joe Marino talking outside the cook shack and goes to listen. 
- Sing Lung, the cook, is inside and can't hear anything over the noise of the water running. 
- Roy sees Gus and The Pup ride away and wonders what Gus meant by saying he may have been an idiot, but he wasn't a polecat. 
- Roy goes to tell Teddy and Mr. Manley that Gus has returned but has ridden away again. 
- Nick Looker tells Teddy and Mr. Manley that Joe Marino told Mr. Trummer that they put their cows in his fields on purpose. 
- Roy is surprised and wonders why Joe Marino would say a thing like that. 
- Nick Looker also says that he found out how all those breaks got in the fence - they were cut. 
- Teddy and Roy are disappointed that they have to stay at the ranch while the others go to Whirlpool River.
