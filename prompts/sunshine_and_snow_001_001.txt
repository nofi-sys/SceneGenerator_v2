- Charley and Arthur are stowaways on a ship bound for Halifax 
- They are caught and Arthur is put to work while Charley is confined to their cabin
- A storm hits and the ship collides with another vessel 
- Arthur and Charley jump overboard and are rescued by the other ship 
- Jim, another stowaway, is badly injured in the collision and dies

The purpose of this scene is to show the bond between the two stowaways, and to contrast their selfless friendship with the selfishness of the other passengers. The author also uses the scene to show the harsh realities of life for poor people in the 19th century.

-Charley: proud of Arthur, protective of the lady
-Arthur: heroic, humble
-Miss Armadale: pleased to see Arthur
-Jim: injured, in surgery
-Tom: crouching outside the door, later holding Jim's hand
