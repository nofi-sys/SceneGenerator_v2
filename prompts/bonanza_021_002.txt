The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is told from Victoria's point of view, and the tone is mostly matter-of-fact, with a few moments of suspense when the man first appears. There is some description of the weather and the landscape, but it is not overly detailed.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and introduce the main character. The author achieves this by describing the weather and the protagonist's journey to the cabin.

The scene opens with Vicky at the mine, thinking about how the weather is getting worse and debating whether or not to ask Sorenson to go back to town with her. She decides against it, not wanting to be obligated to him, and sets off for town.
The wind is blowing harder and the snow is getting deeper, making it difficult for her to see and hard to walk. She takes shelter in a draw to rest and decide what to do, and decides to try to make it to a cabin where Ralph sometimes stays.
When she gets to the cabin, she's surprised to find someone already there - a big, unkempt man who she vaguely recognizes. He's not happy to see her, but she's too tired to care. She warms up by the fire and falls asleep.
When she wakes up, the man has made dinner and she's ravenous. They eat in silence, and afterwards Vicky says she's going to try to make it to town. The man tells her it's not worth it, and she's too tired to argue, so she agrees to stay in the cabin for the night.
