The style of this scene is very descriptive, with a lot of detail about the setting and the characters. There is also a sense of foreboding and suspense, as the reader is not sure what is going to happen next.

West is in a room with a machine that has broken down the spacetime continuum. He sees a man in the painting running down the path and shouts. Nevin is in the painting and running down the path. West raises the pistol and his hand is trembling. He puts up his other hand and steadies the gun. He thumbed the activator and held it there. The flame from the gun's muzzle spat out and mushroomed upon the painting. The painting was gone and the gun's pencil of flame was hissing through an empty steel frame. West moved to the wall behind him and found a tumbler. He thumbed it up and the lights came on. In the light, the smashed machine was a sagging piece of wreckage. Cartwright's body was in the center of the room. A chittering thing ran across the floor and ducked into the dark beneath a table. A grinning face peeped out from behind a chair and squalled at West in cold-boned savagery. West had seen those faces before in old books and magazines. It took the wizardry of the Solar System's best band of scientists to open the door that led into the world beyond.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the true nature of the machine that West has been using. Up until this point, West has been under the impression that the machine simply allows him to travel to different places in time and space. However, the author reveals that the machine actually opens a door to another universe, one that is inhabited by monsters. This revelation is meant to shock and terrify the reader.
