In the morning, Burns tells the others that he has been given a job by Nolan. He is excited about the prospect of working for a good boss. The others congratulate him and wish him luck.
McGonagle comments that Nolan is a good guy, but his mother is an alcoholic and this causes problems for him. Clancy agrees, saying that she is a burden on him.
Tim says that it is a shame, and Jerry adds that her drinking habits are preventing her from living a better life.
O'Hara grunts in agreement, and Schwartz says that she is a pretty woman.
McGonagle then says that Nolan's sister is also attractive, and Jerry comments that she is playing Roddy Ferguson for a fool.
Clancy asks if Roddy is interested in her, and Jerry says that he is. He adds that Dick is protective of her and doesn't want her to get involved with anyone.
Burns then says that O'Connor is going to take Roddy into the business, and McGonagle says that Dick is wary of him.
Clancy is surprised to hear this, as he thought they were friends.
 McGonagle explains that they are not on good terms because of the election. He goes on to say that the election was a heated one, and both men are still sore about it.
O'Hara interrupts to say that it was a bad time, and McGonagle agrees, saying that it was a "regular drag out."
He explains that the two men were fighting for the same position, and when one of them won, the other's supporters left and started their own convention.
Both men were in the fight from that point on, and they spent a lot of money on it.
Nolan worked for Gartenheim, and Ferguson campaigned for O'Connor.
On election night, when Roddy realized that Kelly had tricked the push, he accused Gartenheim of working with the other side.
This led to a fight between him and Nolan, and the two had to be pulled apart.
That is how the situation stands now.
