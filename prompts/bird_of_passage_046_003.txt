The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Larry Flood and to provide some comic relief. The author achieves this by having Larry make a series of comical comments and observations.

A young woman is stranded when her turf-cart breaks down. A turf-cutter named Larry Flood offers to help her, but she refuses and decides to walk the rest of the way. Larry tries to convince her to let him drive her, but she insists on walking. He eventually agrees to take her bag, but only if she pays him six shillings. She does, and he leaves her with the broken-down cart and horse.

The style of this scene is light-hearted and humorous. The tone is friendly and banterous, and the point of view is third person limited.
