The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the conflict. The author achieves this by describing the landscape and the characters' reactions to it. The scene also foreshadows the events to come by hinting at the presence of a mysterious stranger.

The scene opens with Roy and Teddy discussing their plans to catch the Pup, the man who stole their horse and money. They are joined by their father, who tells them that they need to focus on their current task and not worry about the Pup. The three men then ride off into the evening, heading for the lowlands near the Whirlpool River Ranch.
As they ride, the air grows damp and chill, and the night becomes cloudy. They soon come to a rise and decide to camp there for the night, as they do not want to camp in the lowlands.
As they make camp, they discuss Pop's superstition that it is unlucky to stay in lowlands. Suddenly, Nat's pony begins acting strangely, stopping and whinnying as if sensing something. Teddy comments that the pony has done this before when there was a stranger around.
The men then settle down for the night, keeping watch in shifts. During Teddy's shift, he hears a noise and wakes the others. They discover that the Pup is trying to steal their horses.
The men give chase, but the Pup gets away. They return to camp and discuss their options. They decide to split up and search for the Pup in pairs. Teddy and Roy will take the lowlands while their father and Pop take the highlands.
As they search, Teddy and Roy find themselves growing more and more tired. Suddenly, they see the Pup in the distance. They give chase, but he gets away again. They return to their father and Pop, who have also had no luck.
The men then decide to head back to the ranch. As they ride, they discuss their options. They decide to put up flyers with the Pup's description and offer a reward for his capture. They also decide to notify the sheriff and ask for their help.
