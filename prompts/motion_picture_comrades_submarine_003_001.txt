Oscar grabs a gun and tries to shoot the shark, but his gun runs out of ammunition. He drops the gun in despair, but Jack, who is still cranking his camera, encourages him to keep going.
The natives in their canoe paddle over to Ballyhoo and Oscar and start to splash in the water, keeping the shark away. One of the natives dives into the water with a knife between his teeth. He comes up underneath the shark and stabs it, causing it to bleed to death. Ballyhoo is saved!
