The style of this scene is very formal and serious. The tone is somber and the point of view is third person omniscient.

- Don Manuel is scandalously late to lunch and tells Rosa and Carlotta that he has been tracking a crime

- Don Manuel has a copy of the murderer's confession and has sent copies to Chavez and Hermengildo
- Pablo Hinestrosa was chosen to kill Estifanio and Don Jos helped in the killing
- Don Jos and Spallo took Pablo home after the murder and when they left, the ghost of Estifanio's father came in and sat beside him
- Pablo ran into the street and said that Estifanio kept looking through the windows at him
- Don Manuel got a doctor to give Pablo an opiate and he is now asleep in Chacon's house
- Congress meets at eight and Don Manuel plans to arraign the palace on this question

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Manuel and Carlotta, and to set up the conflict between the two. Manuel is a passionate idealist who is committed to fighting injustice, while Carlotta is a more pragmatic thinker who is skeptical of Pablo's story. This disagreement between the two will drive the plot forward.
