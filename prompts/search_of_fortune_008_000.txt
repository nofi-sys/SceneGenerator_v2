- Old Kate is a superstitious woman who believes in ghosts, goblins, and other supernatural creatures.
- One day, she comes into the breakfast parlour and tells the Squire's wife about a wooden tombstone she found in her pantry.
- The Squire and his wife laugh, but old Kate is adamant that the tombstone is responsible for her rheumatism.
- Kate and her grandson Peter are frequent visitors to the room in the tower where Archie lives.
- One evening, while Kate is telling ghost stories, Archie decides to play a practical joke on her.
- He uses a pair of bellows to make a spooky noise, and also lights a candle with a sulphur-dipped wick.
