The author is trying to achieve two goals: first, to show the reader the poverty and desperation of the young mathematician, and second, to contrast the mathematician's poverty with the Spiritual Professor's wealth.

- Boanerges Phospher: the "Spiritual Professor", a man on a mission to save as many people as possible
- the young mathematician: a thin, emaciated man, consumed by his work and struggling to survive on meager resources

The scene opens with the young mathematician, seated in a rickety chair, beside a dirty pine table, which is strewn with manuscripts covered with many a tedious column of figures and mysterious-looking diagrams. He is dressed in tattered clothes and looks pale and emaciated. He is muttering to himself about his poverty and the over-tasking of his brain.
At this moment, the Spiritual Professor, with his hair all nice behind his ears, comes bustling forward toward the table, rubbing his hands in glee. He exclaims that he is the young man's spiritual child and asks if he has finished his work.
The student shakes his head slightly and mutters that he cannot finish it. The Professor's face turns blank and white at the same time as he realizes that the young man is not going to be able to complete his work. He begins to berate the young man, saying that he must finish it and that he will be reduced to bread and water if he does not. The Professor continues to rant, saying that he has striven for six months to drive out the evil spirits, but it seems that they have re-entered the young man. He decides that the only way to save him is to reduce him to bread and water and make him start his work again from the beginning.
