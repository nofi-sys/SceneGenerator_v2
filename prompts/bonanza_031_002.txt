Father Marston, a chaplain and former soldier, faces down the notorious criminal Sam Dutch, who has been terrorizing the town. Marston orders Dutch to leave town immediately, and Dutch eventually agrees.

The literary style of this scene is intense and dramatic. The tone is serious and foreboding, and the point of view is from Vicky's perspective. The language is flowery and descriptive, and the preacher's speech is full of biblical references.

1. Marston - a chaplain and former soldier with a strong sense of justice
2. Dutch - a murderer and outlaw, on the run from the law
3. Vickys - the victim, a young girl who is being held against her will
