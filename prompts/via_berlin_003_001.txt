Topham and Ferreira are sitting in a train carriage in Germany when two other German men start a fight with them. Topham and Ferreira are both knocked down and the two German men sit on top of them, panting. The train then starts moving again and the two German men leave the carriage. Topham is angry and humiliated but does not want to fight a duel. Ferreira tears up the German men's cards and throws them out the window. Topham then realizes his envelope is missing and assumes the German men took it. The rest of the trip is uneventful.

The tone of this scene is one of anger and frustration, mixed with a touch of humor. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Topham's perspective. The style is straightforward and matter-of-fact.

-Topham: an American navy officer, big and strong
-Ferreira: Topham's Brazilian companion, small and wiry
-The two Germans: strong, aggressive, and rude
