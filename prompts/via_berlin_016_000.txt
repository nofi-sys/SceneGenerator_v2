A man is sitting on a terrace, thinking about the woman he loves. He knows she is in Tokyo, but he does not know why. He wonders if she is there for him or for some other reason. He thinks about the possible reasons for her being there and decides that it is most likely because of trade. However, he doubts that this is the true reason. He thinks it is more likely that she is there for a war conspiracy against the United States. He is interrupted by a Japanese maid, who bows to him.
