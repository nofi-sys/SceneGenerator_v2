The literary style of this scene is informal and colloquial. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is lighthearted and humorous.

The scene opens with two cowboys, Yerby and Rogers, discussing the recent news that Tait has crossed the "dead line" again and is headed for the Thunder Mountain country. Yerby is an old cowboy from Texas who has seen his share of frontier life, and Rogers is the owner of the Circle B R. They are both in agreement that Tait needs to be stopped, and they decide to gather a few more men to help them with their plan.
Rowan, Silcott, and Cole are recruited to help with the plan, and they all meet at the Three Pines at midnight. They discuss their strategy and then head out to the Circle Diamond to start rounding up Tait's cattle.
Once they have the cattle, they drive them back to the Three Pines and wait for Tait to show up. When he does, they confront him and demand that he turn over his sheep. Tait refuses, and a fight ensues. In the end, Tait is killed and his sheep are taken.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Yerby and Rowan, and to set up the conflict between them and Tait. The author achieves this by having them discuss Tait's recent actions and their plans to stop him.
