A man is trying to get to La Boca by boat, but is delayed by an inquisitive man who asks a lot of questions. He eventually gets on the boat, which is headed by the master, Chigo, the boatman, and Luigi, the boy. They all have a breakfast together before Hi is amused by the fish in the water. Something then blunders up alongside the boat, but misses Hi and disappears.
