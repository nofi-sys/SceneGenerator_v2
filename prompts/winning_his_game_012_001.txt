Jimmy is helping Dud become more social and popular at school. Nick and Hugh already know about the scheme and find it amusing. Jimmy insists that he's helped Dud a lot and that Dud is now on speaking terms with most of the school's social elite.

-Jimmy: the mastermind behind the scheme to make Dud more popular; he is also friends with Nick and Hugh
-Dud: the shy, graven image of a boy who is the subject of Jimmy's scheme; he is also friends with Nick and Hugh
-Nick: one of Jimmy's friends and an accomplice in the scheme; he is also friends with Hugh
-Hugh: one of Jimmy's friends and an accomplice in the scheme; he is also friends with Nick

The tone of this scene is lighthearted and joking. The point of view is Jimmy's, and he is telling the story of how he "popularized" Dud. The style is conversational, with Jimmy's thoughts and words intermingled.
