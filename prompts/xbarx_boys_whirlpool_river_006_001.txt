The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of J.K. Marino and to foreshadow the conflict that will occur between him and Teddy. The author also uses this scene to establish the setting and to introduce the other characters who will be important in the story.

-Teddy throws out J.K. Marino after he tries to murder him
-Marino is a cow-puncher who is not as good as he claims to be
-Teddy and Roy talk about what to do with Marino
-Nat Raymond and Pop Burns talk about what to do with Gus
-They both decide to try to find Gus and bring him back

The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is written in third person point of view, with a focus on Teddy's perspective. The tone is tense and suspenseful, as Teddy is faced with a dangerous situation. There is also a bit of humor, as Teddy makes fun of Marino's claim to be a cowpuncher.
