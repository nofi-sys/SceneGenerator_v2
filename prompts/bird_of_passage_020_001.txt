The scene opens with a conversation between Mr. Lisle and Helen Denis. Mr. Lisle has just given Helen a ring as a gift, and she is telling her father about it. Colonel Denis is surprised to hear this, as he had not previously considered Mr. Lisle to be one of Helen's admirers. Mr. Lisle explains that the ring is just a memento of their friendship, and Colonel Denis is relieved. Helen then says that she will always keep the ring and treasure it. The scene ends with the two men gazing at the ring on Helen's finger, thinking that it is very pretty.

The style of this scene is very formal and polite. The tone is respectful and friendly, and the point of view is third person limited.
