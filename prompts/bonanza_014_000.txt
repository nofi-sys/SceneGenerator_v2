The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Robert Dodson and to establish his background. The author also uses this scene to contrast the McClintock brothers with Dodson, and to foreshadow the conflict that will arise between them.

The style of this scene is rather dry and matter-of-fact. There is little emotion or color, and the focus is on the events and characters rather than on the atmosphere or setting.
