- Two boys are on their way to Eagles, leading a third horse.
- The day is hot and the road is dusty.
- The boys argue about which of their horses is better.
- Teddy turns on Roy when he mentions a boy named Gilly Froud.
- They continue on their way, trying to make it to the station before their dad's train arrives.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two brothers and to foreshadow the conflict that will arise later in the story. The author achieves this by having the two brothers argue good-naturedly with each other and by having Teddy Manley become angry when his brother mentions the name of their father's enemy, Gilly Froud.
