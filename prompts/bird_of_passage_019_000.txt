Miss Denis, who had been previously scared, is now feeling brave after Aboo, a prisoner, is led up on deck. Mrs. Creery is in the middle of an anxious circle, telling a story in which she is the protagonist. Mr. Lisle, who saved Mrs. Creery, is being praised by everyone. Miss Caggett, however, is not impressed and finds the whole situation humorous.

- Miss Denis: a brave girl who saved Mr. Lisle's life
- Aboo: a prisoner who was led up on deck, cursing and howling
- Mrs. Creery: the center of an anxious circle, volubly narrating a story
- Helen: broken-down and trembling, clinging to her father
- Mr. Lisle: minus his hat, his coat in rags, and his arm in a sling
- the General: came up from the saloon
- Dr. Malone: came up from the saloon
- Mr. Quentin: an elegant, indolent fop
- Miss Caggett: Lizzie, a malicious giggle

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Miss Denis and Mr. Lisle as brave and heroic. The author also uses the scene to contrast the two characters with Miss Caggett, who is portrayed as jealous and ungrateful.
