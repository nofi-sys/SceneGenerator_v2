- Colonel Denis: a nervous man
- Mr. Quentin: a charming man
- Mr. Lisle: a man who is being interrogated by Mrs. Creery
- Mrs. Creery: a florid, round-faced woman in a sulphur-coloured sateen costume

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Mrs. Creery and to establish her as a nosy, gossipy woman. The author achieves this by having her ask a series of personal questions and make observations about the other characters.

Mrs. Creery, a florid, ample woman in a sulphur-colored sateen costume, approaches a group of men who are discussing whale-boats. She has a yellow-and-white dog with her that she calls "Nip." Mrs. Creery is surprised to see Mr. Lisle among the group, as he rarely leaves the mainland, and she begins to interrogate him about his recent activities. Mr. Lisle is evasive, but Mrs. Creery is unanswerable and correctly guesses that he has been buying collars in the bazaar. She then turns her attention to Mr. Quentin and comments on the fact that he has been playing tennis at the General's. Mr. Quentin is uncomfortable and makes an excuse to leave. Mrs. Creery continues to interrogate Mr. Lisle about his plans to leave the island, and he is evasive.
