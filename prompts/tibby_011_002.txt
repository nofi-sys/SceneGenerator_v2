The literary style of this scene is characterized by its lyrical, romantic tone. The point of view is from that of Mrs. Lucien, who is deeply moved by the natural phenomena she is witnessing. The language is highly poetic, with frequent use of metaphors and similes.

-Mrs. Lucien: a woman who is interested in the supernatural and believes in the power of materialization
-Mrs. Wylie: a practical woman who is skeptical of the supernatural and believes that any new belief will attract many who are no honor to it
-Hermann: a magician who can surpass materialization

Mrs. Lucien and Mrs. Wylie are discussing the latter's skepticism about spiritualism. Mrs. Lucien argues that even Christ materialized after his crucifixion, so there is nothing wrong with seeking the truth through mediumistic means. Mrs. Wylie counters that the days of miracles are over and that the whole practice is undignified and often leads to sorrow.
The two women step out onto a balcony overlooking the street. A storm is brewing and the atmosphere is heavy and oppressive. Mrs. Lucien comments on how all of nature seems to be responding to the impending storm, and Mrs. Wylie reluctantly agrees.
Suddenly, Mrs. Lucien's mood changes and she becomes inspired by the storm. She sees it as a symbol of life, and argues that even in the midst of darkness and turmoil, there is always hope. Mrs. Wylie is moved by Mrs. Lucien's words and admits that she too feels a sense of awe at the power of nature.
