The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Annie and Stephen, and to set up the conflict between them. Annie is trying to help her husband, Harry, by sending him money secretly through Stephen. Stephen is reluctant to take the money, because he knows Harry would be offended if he knew it came from Annie. This sets up the conflict between Annie's desire to help her husband and Stephen's loyalty to Harry.

2. Annie tells Stephen to tell Harry that the money comes from George or Lady Braithwaite.
3. Annie is worried about Stephen's health.
4. Annie wonders where Stephen lives and if he is in need of money.
