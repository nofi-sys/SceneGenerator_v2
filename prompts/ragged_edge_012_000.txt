- Mrs. Burns: a lady bent over her washtub, taking the skin from her knuckles rubbing one of Tim's red flannel shirts.
- Mrs. Nolan: a lady hanging out her wash, her mouth stopped with clothes-pins and her skirts tucked up out of the damp.
- Mrs. McGonagle: a lady sitting upon Mrs. Burns doorstep watching the efforts of her hostess across the drifting steam.
- Goose: a man whose shirts get into such a state from his bit of work, that the washing fair takes Mrs. McGonagle's breath from her.
- Mary: a woman who is failing fast.
- Larry: a man who is hovering about the sick-room.
- Mrs. Kelly: a woman who declared that a little time had elapsed since the events narrated in the preceding chapters, and that Mary's frail health had suddenly failed.
- Mr. Kelly: a man who said that it was this sort of thing--and worse--that had caused the indignation of the trio of ladies in the court.
- Rosie OHara: a woman who came into the kitchen by the back door.
