The scene opens with the narrator reflecting on his youth, when people were not as advanced in their understanding of visions and apparitions. He recalls how those who were tormented by such visions were laughed at and ridiculed, and how he himself would have never thought to attribute them to anything other than a bad digestion or atmospheric influence.
The narrator then describes how, during his recent terrible experience, he severely reprimanded himself for his weakness of mind, without once considering that the visions might be real. He goes on to say that he is resolved not to tell anyone about the experience, and that he slept well until Baptiste knocked on his door to inform him that breakfast was ready.
The narrator describes how, upon entering the salon, he saw Madame d'Ionis and was immediately struck by her beauty. They exchange pleasantries and the dowager Countess soon declares that the narrator looks ill and pale. The narrator then recalls his instructions from Zphyrine and tells the dowager and Madame d'Ionis that he had pleasant dreams.
The dowager is delighted and asks him to recount his dreams. The narrator obliges, but says that they were very confused and that he can only remember a lady (or possibly two or three ladies). The dowager is thrilled and says that she will explain why she is so interested in his dreams later on.

- protagonist: young, handsome, well-dressed man who resembles his beautiful late mother
- Madame d'Ionis: bewitching woman, fresh, gay, and lively; intelligent and resolute with a sweet manner
- dowager Countess: old lady who is enchanted by the idea of hearing about the protagonist's dreams
- Zphyrine: servant who is seated at the lower end of the table and exchanging looks with Madame d'Ionis

The style of this scene is conversational and light-hearted. There is a sense of humor and playfulness in the exchanges between the characters. The point of view is third person limited, and the narrator is omniscient.
