The scene opens with a young wife reflecting on her marriage to an unsuitable husband. She recalls how impulsive and careless he has become since their wedding, and wonders what she should do with her life. Suddenly, he returns and she must put on a brave face. He begins to argue with her, but she quickly shuts him down. It is clear that she is the stronger of the two. However, when his brother's proposal arrives, he is once again at her feet, begging her not to go. She knows she must be the one to make the decision, and so she agrees to stay.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Harry and Annie. The author achieves this by showing that they have different values and that they are not able to communicate effectively.

1. Harry: a young, impulsive man who is not very bright or principled
2. Annie: a sensitive 18-year-old who is stuck in a loveless marriage
3. George: Harry's older brother, who is a bit of a savage
4. their father: not mentioned much, but seems to be a reasonable man
5. various grooms and jockeys: not very bright or principled either
