The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no real description of the setting or the characters, and the dialogue is mostly exposition. However, the author does use some flowery language to describe the cordial that the characters drink.

- A man with a mahogany-colored face, like a frog, begins to sing a doleful ballad with a chorus in which all join.
- The frog man produces a bag containing three small bottles with brightly colored labels showing ladies of a free disposition.
- The brake pulls up by the wayside, so that no Smile might be spilled. The good Hernando dispenses something like a quarter of a bottle to each of the company.
- When the brake drove on again, the mandoline struck up a Smile of the Muse: the reed-pipe piped to it and the company sang.
- In the dusk of the evening the brake halted in San Marco, which was a town of six farms and a chapel.
- Someone had come in with news which brought all the town out of doors. When the news reached the wedding party, it changed their tone.
- They brought him a half-cask and hot water: after his bathe they gave him a clean cotton sleeping suit and a bed with Christian sheets.
- In the afternoon of the next day, when he woke, he found his clothes washed and mended. Uncle Philip and the girl brought him a coat, a sombrero and a pair of new shoes.
- Hi asked the girl what had happened. She said, "There is war." When he asked where it is, she said, "It was near here, within a short ride, yesterday, going to Anselmo, the place you asked about."
