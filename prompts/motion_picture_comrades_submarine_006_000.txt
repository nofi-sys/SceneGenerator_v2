- Back and forth the pair swam, tearing at each other as though anxious to take advantage of this unusual flood of light visiting their undersea range. 
- One was a little larger than the other, and, of course, the boys immediately allowed their hopes to rest upon the smaller shark. 
- The smaller shark proved to be more agile of the two, and could get away with less punishment after some of their terrific rushes. 
- From this fact the spectators expected that in the end the battle would result in the vanquishing of the larger spotted fish, which appeared a trifle sluggish in its movements. 
- The two sharks stayed close to each other, and continued to snap viciously; but the jaws of the big spotted one lacked something of their former vigor. 
- Indeed, it could be seen that this fish was at the end of his rope, for he swung this way and that, as though unable to guide his course. 
- Even as the spectators continued to stare through their glass-covered windows, arranged for this very purpose, and well protected against all pressure to be met with down at the depth to which the boat could be lowered, they saw the larger shark give a last flip with its tail, and then roll over, belly up. 
- Ballyhoo was heard saying quite revengefully, just as if he had taken a vow upon himself never to spare a shark when he had a chance to annihilate such a creature. 
- Oscar called out that the victor is almost as badly off, and that he sees how he wobbles as he starts to swim away. 
- Ballyhoo asserted that the luck of the Camera Boys still holds good, and that everything comes their way, given time. 
- Jack was heard saying that he only hopes his pictures turn out first class, as he has never had any experience taking such through a heavy glass like these observation windows or big bulls-eyes are made of. 
- Oscar, wishing to satisfy the anxiety of the operator, hastened to assure him that all was well. 
- Ballyhoo announced that the engines have started up again, and that the show being over, they mean to commence going on again.
