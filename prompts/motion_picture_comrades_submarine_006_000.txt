The two sharks swam back and forth, tearing at each other. The smaller shark was more agile and got away with less punishment. The larger shark appeared to be a trifle sluggish in its movements. The two sharks stayed close to each other and continued to snap viciously. The big spotted one lacked something of their former vigor. The larger shark gave a last flip with its tail and then rolled over, belly up.

-The two sharks, one larger and one smaller
-The spectators, including Ballyhoo, Oscar, and Jack

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by having the characters talk to each other.

-The smaller shark proved to be more agile of the two, and could get away with less punishment after some of their terrific rushes.
-From this fact the spectators expected that in the end the battle would result in the vanquishing of the larger spotted fish, which appeared a trifle sluggish in its movements. 
-The two sharks stayed close to each other, and continued to snap viciously; but the jaws of the big spotted one lacked something of their former vigor. 
-Even as the spectators continued to stare through their glass-covered windows, arranged for this very purpose, and well protected against all pressure to be met with down at the depth to which the boat could be lowered, they saw the larger shark give a last flip with its tail, and then roll over, belly up. 
-Ballyhoo was heard saying quite revengefully, just as if he had taken a vow upon himself never to spare a shark when he had a chance to annihilate such a creature. 
-Oscar called out that the victor is almost as badly off, and that he sees how he wobbles as he starts to swim away. 
-Ballyhoo asserted that the luck of the Camera Boys still holds good, and that everything comes their way, given time.
