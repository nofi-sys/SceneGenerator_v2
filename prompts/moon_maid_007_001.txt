The style of this scene is third person limited point of view. The narrator knows the thoughts and feelings of the character Orthis, but not of the other characters. The tone is curious and matter-of-fact.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two main characters, and to provide information about their respective worlds. The author achieves this by having the characters discuss their worlds and their differences.

- Ga-va-go, chief of the No-vans, kills a mutinous warrior and tells the others to divide and eat the carcass.
- The No-vans are a naturally quarrelsome and disagreeable group, made more so by hunger and the discomforts of a recent storm.
- Ga-va-go leads the group with two prisoners, one of which is a girl that he speaks to.
- The girl is from Va-nah, a world that she says is just a large rock with a space in the center that they call home.
- The girl is curious about the Earth and the 21st century man that Ga-va-go has captured.
