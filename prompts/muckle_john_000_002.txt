Rob Fraser is a young boy in Inverness, Scotland, in the year 1745. He is a Jacobite, and is excited by the news that the Pretender ( Bonnie Prince Charlie) is coming to claim the throne. However, he is also aware that the Hanoverian garrison is about to evacuate the town, and that there is likely to be chaos when the Highland army arrives.
Rob goes to the school where he is a pupil, and is surprised to find it empty. He sneaks into the schoolmaster's study, where he hears two men talking. He is caught eavesdropping by the schoolmaster, who demands to know what he has heard.
Rob insists that he has heard nothing, but the schoolmaster does not believe him. He is about to be punished with a cane when the other man intervenes, saying that Rob is only a child and does not know anything. The schoolmaster reluctantly agrees, and lets Rob go.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Mr. Macaulay and to establish his suspicious nature. The author also uses this scene to create a sense of foreboding and tension, as the reader wonders what Rob overheard and whether he is in danger.
