-Helen Denis: the protagonist of the scene, a young woman who has recently moved to Cream Street. She is visited by Lady Grubb, who is Mrs. Creery's sister.
-Carrie and Clara Platt: Helen's cousins, who are also visiting her at Cream Street. They are both older than Helen, and are very judgmental of Lady Grubb.
-Lady Grubb: Mrs. Creery's sister, who is very stout and is wearing a long black satin cloak and a gorgeous bonnet. She is very chatty, and is interested in all the news from Port Blair.

The style of this scene is very formal and stilted. The dialogue is stiff and the characters seem to be uncomfortable with each other. There is a sense of tension and awkwardness throughout the scene.
