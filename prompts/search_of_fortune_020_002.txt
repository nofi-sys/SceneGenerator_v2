Archie, a young man living in Sydney, is struggling to make ends meet. He has no job and is running out of money. He is considering writing home to beg for more money, but is ashamed to do so.
One day, he finds an old letter of introduction from his uncle. The letter is for a Mr. Winslow, who is now a wealthy man. Archie decides to pay him a visit.
He is met at the door by a beautiful young girl, who takes him into a luxuriously furnished room. After a brief wait, Mr. Winslow enters, and Archie is surprised to find that he is a rough-looking man, dressed in casual clothes.
Mr. Winslow is friendly and offers to buy Archie a drink. Archie declines, saying that he did not come to drink or to beg for a job. Mr. Winslow tells him that he could have offered him a job as his under-gardener.
