-The broken-down pugilist: a man with a clownish face, he is the focus of the scene; he is drunk and has a hangover
-The six tough-fisted mechanics: the men who were recruited by Dacres in the emergency; they are looking ill at ease
-Lawrence Dacres: the tall, blond man who is speaking to the mechanics; he is the captain of the ship

The style of this scene is light and comedic, with a touch of farce. The point of view is third person omniscient, allowing the reader to see all that is happening while remaining unobserved. The tone is light and humorous, with a bit of tension created by the unknown man's antics.
