The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Hugh McClintock and Dutch, and to establish the character of each man. The author achieves this by having them face off against each other, with Hugh remaining calm and Dutch looking increasingly agitated.

Hugh McClintock is bill-posting around town with his faithful colored assistant when he is accosted by Jim Budd, who tells him that Dutch is waiting for him in front of Dodson's store. Hugh thanks Jim but tells him that he can handle the situation alone.
Hugh crosses the street to where Dutch and Hopkins are waiting for him. Dutch tells him to stop bill-posting, but Hugh ignores him and continues to put up posters. Dutch finally loses his temper and threatens Hugh, but the young man is unafraid.
Hugh pulls out a bowie knife and tells Dutch that he is looking for the owner of the knife. Dutch recognizes the knife as one that he has been playing with threateningly before, and realizes that Hugh is challenging him to a showdown.
The two men stare each other down, and finally Dutch backs down. He turns and walks away, followed by Hopkins. The onlookers breathe a sigh of relief, and Hugh goes back to his work.
