The purpose of this scene is to establish Mrs. Creery's character as a nosy, interfering busybody. The author achieves this by having her pry into Colonel Denis's personal life and make insensitive comments about his daughter.

- Mrs. Creery offers to pay the traveling photographer to take pictures of her and her bungalow, but he declines, saying he is not a professional. 
- Mrs. Creery is not deterred and continues to ask him questions. 
- She then turns her attention to Colonel Denis and starts asking him personal questions about his daughter whom he has not seen in 13 years. 
- Mr. Quentin and the photographer take their leave while Mrs. Creery continues talking.

The style of this scene is light-hearted and humorous. The tone is playful and friendly, and the point of view is third person limited.
