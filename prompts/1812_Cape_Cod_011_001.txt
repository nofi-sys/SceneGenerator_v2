The style of this scene is formal and objective. The tone is businesslike, and the point of view is third person limited.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Captain Raggett and the people of Cape Cod. Raggett is determined to force the people to pay tribute, and he is willing to use violence if necessary. The people of Cape Cod, on the other hand, are struggling to resist Raggett's demands. This conflict will drive the rest of the story.
