Mrs Crampton is sitting in her dark room with her sister, Aunt Clem. She is talking about her daughter, Jenny, who has recently died. Mrs Crampton is struggling to come to terms with her death and is finding it hard to believe that Jenny is gone.
Suddenly, they hear the sound of carriage wheels coming up the drive. They both know that it is the funeral coaches, returning from the station where they had been ordered to await the nine oclock train.
Mrs Crampton becomes frantic and says that she must go to meet her daughter's body. Aunt Clem tries to stop her, but she is determined. She runs out of the room and down the stairs, where she is met by the funeral procession.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Mrs Crampton and to foreshadow the events to come. The author achieves this by having Mrs Crampton talk about her daughter, Jenny, and her own sorrow at her death. This scene also sets up the conflict between Mrs Crampton and her husband, John, over the death of their daughter.
