Hugh McClintock is riding through the Nevada desert on his horse, Nevada Jim. He is heading south of the Silver Mountains, and is planning to go through Alkali Flat and circle Walker Lake. However, he knows that he might run into the Piutes, and so he is prepared for anything.
Suddenly, he hears a rustling in the bushes and realizes that there are wild animals nearby. He continues on, and the sun sets, turning the sky a deep purple. He keeps riding through the night, using the stars to guide him, until he reaches Alkali Flat.
There, he decides to rest for a few hours, and so he pickets Nevada Jim and falls asleep. A few hours later, he is woken up by the sound of horses, and he realizes that he has stumbled upon a party of Piutes who are camped in the valley below. He also smells roasted meat, and realizes that the Piutes are probably eating horseflesh.
McClintock tries to turn back, but he is spotted by a Piute sentry. The sentry takes a shot at him, and McClintock charges straight at the brave, knocking him down. He then hears shouts from the valley as the other Piutes spot him and begin to give chase.
McClintock rides down into the valley and manages to lose his pursuers. However, he knows that they will be back, and so he decides to make a run for it. He rides all day and into the night, finally reaching safety.
