The literary style of this scene is one of suspense and foreboding. The tone is ominous, and the point of view is from Hi's perspective. The setting is a dark and stormy night in the forest, which adds to the sense of foreboding. The description of the weather and the environment creates a feeling of unease and dread.

It is midnight, and Hi is awake, sweating and cramping. He feels something terrible is about to happen. The air is thick and hot, the forest is eerily silent. Suddenly, the storm breaks. The wind and rain are so violent, Hi is sure the world is ending. He takes shelter and waits it out. 
When the storm finally passes, Hi emerges to find the world changed. The ground is covered in mud and debris, the trees are stripped of leaves. He makes his way through the mess, cold and soaked. He comes to a river and has to blindfold his horse to get him across. 
On the other side, he finds a stone with an inscription: "Pray for the souls of Espinar, Gamarro, Velarde. Drowned here." Hi wonders how he made it across the river. He has lost all sense of direction and doesn't know where he is. 
He remembers his friend's directions and tries to keep to the left. He comes to a bridge and is forced to cross it. On the other side, he finds a stone with an inscription: "Pray for the souls of Espinar, Gamarro, Velarde. Drowned here." Hi wonders how he made it across the river. He has lost all sense of direction and doesn't know where he is. 
He comes to a fork in the road and takes the left, as his friend had told him. He climbs up a hill and is finally able to see where he is. He is in the country of the sun.
