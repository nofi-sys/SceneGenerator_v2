Alice is surprised to see Professor Russell at her home, as she had assumed he had left for other lands. He tells her he has numerous unseen messengers and she shivers. She introduces him to her sister-in-law, Mrs. Wylie, and to Tibby. He is struck by Tibby's beauty. Tibby regards him steadily and he appears to be trying to look her out of countenance.
Mrs. Wylie notices a strange electrical charge in the air and Alice feels it too. Tibby seems unaffected. The Professor tells them he has invited some friends over for a meeting that evening, and Alice is annoyed as her husband Mark is not home and has objected to such gatherings in his absence.
Tibby speaks up and says it would be a lovely idea to go and leave cards when people are away from home. Mrs. Wylie reproves her. The Professor tells them he is sorry for Mark's blindness, and Tibby pretends to be surprised. The Professor becomes annoyed by Tibby's childish scrutiny and changes his position several times. He finally turns on her abruptly.

Alice: She is surprised by the appearance of Professor Russell. He has changed his outward guise and looks like Uriah Heep. Alice does not recognize him at first, but a glance from those gray-green eyes identifies him.
Professor Russell: He is a man who has changed his outward appearance. He is clean-shaven with a red mustache. His hair is closely cut. He has gray-green eyes.
Mrs. Wylie: She is Tibby's sister-in-law. She is plucking a bunch of prairie flowers when Professor Russell arrives.
Tibby: She is a beautiful girl. She is ill-bred. She has yellow eyes.
Robert: He is Tibby's brother.
