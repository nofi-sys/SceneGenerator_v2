The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is told from a third person point of view, and the tone is one of resignation and fatigue. There is a bit of dialogue, but mostly the scene is a description of the characters' actions and thoughts.

The scene opens with Jessie Norwood and Amy sitting on deck, exhausted from trying to send a distress signal via radio. They reflect on the direness of their situation - the yacht is sinking and they are slowly running out of supplies. Dr. Stanley remains outwardly cheerful, but the others are growing more anxious. The radio is their only hope, but it is beginning to fail.
 Jessie and Amy are relieved when the sun begins to rise, but their hope is short-lived when they see a fog rolling in. Amy makes a dark joke about their situation, and Jessie is horrified. They sit in silence for a moment, contemplating their fate.
