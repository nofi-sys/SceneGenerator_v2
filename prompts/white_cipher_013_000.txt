Fay is being held captive on a destroyer headed for England. He is in an ensign's cabin, which was recently vacated. He is being interrogated by the Scotch detective, MacKeenon, about a package he stole from the embassy safe in Holland. Fay insists that he gave the package to Saidee Isaacs and that she is the only one who knows its whereabouts. MacKeenon is not satisfied with this answer and continues to question Fay about the package. Fay remains tight-lipped and refuses to say anything else. MacKeenon eventually gives up and leaves the cabin. Fay is left alone to think about his situation. He reviews the series of events that led to his capture and concludes that Saidee Isaacs is the only one he can trust.
