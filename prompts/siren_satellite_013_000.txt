The purpose of this scene is to provide comic relief after the excitement of the earlier events. The author achieves this goal by having the character McCray try to fight Strike again, only to be thwarted by an injury. This allows the characters and the reader to laugh and enjoy a moment of levity before the story continues.

Tommy Strike and his fiance, Gerry Carlyle, are on their way back to Earth after a stint on Mars. They are met with a hero's welcome, as the news of their adventures has preceded them. Among the crowd is a reporter who spots Kid McCray, the missing Martian middleweight champ.
McCray is revealed to be a stowaway on their ship, and the story of how he came to be there is slowly revealed. He was originally supposed to be part of a boxing match on Mars, but when the event was cancelled, he hitched a ride on _The Ark_ in hopes of getting back to Earth.
During the journey, he proved to be a valuable asset to the crew, but was always treated as a menial. Now that they're back, he wants to have a friendly boxing match with Strike to even the score.
However, before they can begin, McCray trips on a banana peel and sprains his ankle. The match is called off and McCray is left to lick his wounds.

The style of this scene is lighthearted and comedic. The tone is playful and friendly, and the point of view is third person omniscient.
