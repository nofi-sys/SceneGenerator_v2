The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the character of Larry Silcott. The author achieves this by having Larry sing a song as he approaches the ranch, which tells the reader about his work on the round-up. Mrs. Flanders then asks him about the round-up and he tells her about his work. This establishes the setting and gives the reader some information about Larry's character.
