A woman in a mesmeric sleep reveals the secrets of a doctor's past life to him. The doctor is shocked and angry, but the woman insists that she only wants to help him. The doctor is eventually won over, and the two of them share a moment of intimacy. However, they are interrupted by a loud noise from the street below.

The style of this scene is intense and dramatic, with a sense of foreboding and suspense. The point of view is from the doctor's perspective, and the tone is one of fear and anger.

1. The doctor - a middle-aged man, livid and pale, trembling and sweating, with chattering teeth. He is astounded and angry.
2. The woman - lying in bed, apparently in a mesmeric sleep. She is weak and frail, with a sob in her voice. She is watchful and attentive.
3. The crowd in the street - yelling and clamoring.
