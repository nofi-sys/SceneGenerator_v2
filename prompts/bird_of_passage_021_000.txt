The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two main characters, Mr. Lisle and Mr. Quentin. The author achieves this by having the two men discuss their feelings for the same woman, Miss Denis.

- Gilbert Lisle is in love with Helen Denis, but knows he can never tell her
- James Quentin is also in love with Helen, but is not ready to marry her
- Quentin notices that Lisle is interested in Helen and tells him to back off
- Lisle realizes that Quentin is not really in love with Helen, and that she may not be in love with Quentin either
- Quentin starts to get jealous of Lisle and tells him to stay away from Helen

-Mr. Lisle: a man who is deeply and hopelessly in love with Miss Denis, but cannot tell her nor act on his feelings because he is only a confidant to James Quentin. He is good-looking, despite his shabby clothes and sunburnt skin.
-Miss Denis: the object of Mr. Lisle's affections. She is responsive to his attentions, but does not seem to return his feelings. She is also the object of James Quentin's affections, though he does not seem to be deeply in love with her.
-James Quentin: a man who is not deeply in love with Miss Denis, but is determined to keep her as his own. He is a ladies' man and does not want to lose his reputation.
