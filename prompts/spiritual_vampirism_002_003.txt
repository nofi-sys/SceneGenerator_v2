-The crowd: a mob of excited men, some of whom are armed with axes
-The doctor: a benevolent man with a good reputation
-The patient: a panic-stricken woman clutching the doctor tightly
-The Spiritual Professor: a man who is supposed to be ethereal and strong, but is actually scared and weak
-The women of the house: clustered around the Professor in a desperate attempt to get some help from him

The purpose of this scene is to create suspense and tension as the protagonist tries to escape the mob. The author achieves this by having the mob constantly changing their minds about what they want to do, and by having the protagonist's escape route constantly blocked.

A mob of angry men has gathered outside a house, demanding that the women inside be turned over to them. The doctor who lives there tries to reason with them, but they are not interested in listening. Instead, they begin to break down the door.
The doctor hurriedly grabs a sick woman from her bed and tries to make his way downstairs, but he is intercepted by the mob. They demand to know who the woman is, and when they see her face, they recognize her as a woman who has been critical of them in the past.
The mob decides to let the doctor go, but they take the woman and drag her outside. The doctor tries to stop them, but he is powerless to do anything. The mob brutally beats the woman and then throws her into the Hudson River.
