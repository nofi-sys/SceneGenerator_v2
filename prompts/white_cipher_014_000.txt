The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing exposition on the events that have transpired. However, there is a bit of tension and suspense built up as Fay and Saidee enter the House of the Lions, not knowing what to expect. Sir Richard's cryptic comments also add to the sense of mystery.

- Saidee Isaacs and Fay have just arrived at the House of the Lions, where they are met by Sir Richard. 
- Sir Richard tells them that there are other important guests in the house tonight, including the Prime Minister. 
- He explains that the secret of the German dye-cipher has been discovered, and that Fay is to be congratulated on his part in it. 
- Fay and Saidee are both surprised to learn how the cipher was broken.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the identity of the person who has been helping Fay throughout his investigation. This person is none other than the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes.
