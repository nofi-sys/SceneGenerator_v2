The two brothers find branding irons and a fake branding iron at the cabin and realize that the cabin is being used by horse thieves. They decide to go back to their ranch and tell their dad, then come back with the rest of the ranch hands to try to capture the thieves.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two brothers over what to do with the information they have discovered. Roy wants to wait for the rustlers to return and Teddy wants to go get help.

-Pete Balls: brand on one of the irons
-Horse Thieves: brand on one of the irons, possibly the Rope and Clover brand
