The scene opens with the Professor entering the apartment and greeting the head of the family. Melissa takes note of his appearance - he is a middle-aged man with long red hair and whiskers, prominent lower jaw, and flattened ears. His most remarkable feature is a pair of keen gray eyes.
The Professor is introduced to Lissa, and he immediately begins to stare at her in an unsettling way. He comments on her resemblance to her mother, and mentions a scar on her left wrist. Lissa is uncomfortable under his gaze, and is relieved when he is called away to begin his clairvoyant demonstration.
The Professor is given a scrap of paper with words cut out of it, and he goes into a trance. He describes a scene of a woman in a doorway of a house in the southwest United States, looking anxiously westward. He then describes a group of Indians and a white man on horseback, who are being pursued by another group of Indians. The white man and his group escape to the river, where they shoot at the pursuing Indians.
The story produces excitement in the listeners, all of whom are engaged and interested. The Professor's eyes light up and he becomes animated as he tells the story.
