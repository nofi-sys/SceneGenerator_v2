The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the location and the appearance of the three main characters.

-Dido: well-dressed, with a walk like a duchess and a voice like a thrush
-Helen: a real beauty
-Katie: not too bad entirely
-Biddy: an old woman who is peevishly watching the three young ladies leave for a party
-Sally: Biddy's niece, who is timorously trying to make conversation
-Mr. Barry: a man who Biddy thinks has an eye for Denis

- Biddy, the girls' nurse, is preparing them for a tennis party at Ballyredmond and scolds them for getting too dressed up.
- The girls are excited for the party and Biddy tells them that she thinks the party is for Helen, who has been flirting with Mr. Redmond.
- Biddy complains that parties nowadays are not as good as they used to be and that no one ever gets drunk anymore.
- The girls walk to the party through Ballyredmond park and arrive at the house.
