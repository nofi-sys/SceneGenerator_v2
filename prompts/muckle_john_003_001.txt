- The old man, Lord Lovat, recognizes the leader as the Prince (of the Jacobite cause)
- Despite his age, Lord Lovat is still full of energy and determination
- The group fills him in on the details of their defeat at Culloden and the Prince's escape
- Lord Lovat is initially horrified at the news, but Sheridan tries to reassure him that all is not lost
- They discuss their next move, with Sheridan advocating for going to the Isles, and Lord Lovat pushing to stay and fight

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Lord Lovat and to foreshadow the events to come. The author achieves this by having the old man react with disbelief and anger to the news of the defeat at Culloden, and by having him express his hope that the Jacobite cause is not lost.

The style of this scene is very formal and old-fashioned. It is written in third person point of view, with a focus on the conversation between the Prince and Lord Lovat. The tone is one of despair and defeat, with a hint of hope for the future.
