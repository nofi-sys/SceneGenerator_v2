The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by having the characters discuss their plans.

The boys are camped out by the river after a storm, and are worried that the rapids will be too dangerous to navigate in the morning. They discuss the possibility of the cows they are looking for being drowned in a landslide, but Teddy reassures them that it is unlikely. They all go to bed eventually, but are restless and unable to sleep.
