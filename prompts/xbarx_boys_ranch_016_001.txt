The style of this scene is fast-paced and exciting, with a lot of dialogue between the characters. The point of view is third person omniscient, and the tone is tense and suspenseful.

The X Bar X punchers are chasing after the rustlers who stole their cattle. They are led by Mr. Manley, and they are not stopping to change their clothes. They are armed with heavy revolvers.
