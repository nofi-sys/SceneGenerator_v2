In early days in Nevada, it was a matter of pride among the desperadoes to be cock of the walk. Many a bad man died with his boots on because he aspired to be chief among his fellows. The community paid little attention to their murders as long as they killed each other. When good citizens fell victim, a sentiment was created which eventually resulted in the supremacy of law.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its matter-of-fact tone and its third-person point of view. There is no emotional language or description, and the events are related simply and directly. This allows the reader to focus on the action and the characters, and to form their own opinions about what is happening.
