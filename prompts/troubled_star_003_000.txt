The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and introduce the main characters. The author also establishes the conflict in this scene, which is that the Earth is being visited by aliens who are not sure how to proceed because the inhabitants of Earth seem to be more primitive than they expected.

Scyth Radnor, Bren, and Chat are on Mercury discussing their options. They have determined that they cannot set up a beacon with people on Earth, so they decide that Scyth will go to Earth and contact Dusty Britton to explain the situation. 
Scyth arrives on Earth and finds Dusty Britton at the White Sands Spaceport. He explains the situation to Dusty, who agrees to help. Dusty makes a public announcement to the people of Earth, telling them about the beacon and how to prepare for it. 
Scyth, Bren, and Chat continue to prepare the beacon while people on Earth begin to build colonies and prepare for the arrival of the beacon.

The style of this scene is very formal and scientific. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is very matter-of-fact.
