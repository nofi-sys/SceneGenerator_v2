David and Elizabeth are discussing the possible implications of David's potential possession of an old house. Elizabeth points out that, while the house is legally David's, there may be moral reasons why he should give it up. She also suggests that the house may hinder, rather than help, David in his quest for something else. David is undecided, and Elizabeth refuses to act as jury, pronouncing the verdict.
