Muckle John enters the room where Lord Lovat is sitting and tells him that he knows about the promises he made to Castleleathers. Lovat tries to downplay the situation, but John is not convinced. He tells Lovat that he needs to make things right with Castleleathers and leaves the room.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of menace. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Lovat. The tone is cold and calculating.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Lovat and Muckle John. Lovat is an old man who is facing execution, and Muckle John is the man who has come to kill him. The author achieves this purpose by having the two men argue with each other and by showing how Lovat is trying to prepare for his death.
