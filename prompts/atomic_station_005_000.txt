-Anne: A young woman who works in the library. She is serious and dedicated to her work.
-Sheldon: A man who is looking for answers about his friend, Gale. He is impatient and eager to find out what happened to him.
-Gale: Sheldon's friend who has been gone for a long time. He is tired and aged, but his eyes still hold the same kindness as before.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the contents of Gale's message to Sheldon. Gale explains that Sheldon will travel through time and return a century later, to a world that is aged and changed.

- Anne's face becomes grave and she leads Sheldon to the library
- The library is musty with cobwebs and shadows. It is filled with micro-film cabinets.
- Anne unlocks a cabinet with a key and hands Sheldon a roll of micro-film.
- Sheldon threads the film into the projector and Gale's face comes into view.
- Gale looks haggard and old. He explains that they decided not to tell Sheldon that the six months he would be gone would be a hundred and ten years.
- Sheldon cries out. Gale continues speaking and explains that Sheldon will be traveling through a complete arc on the Lorentz scale and will return a century from now. 
- Sheldon hears only an unintelligible jumble of syllables and sees only a vague splotch of light. Then his vision grows sharp again and Gale's words come clearly.
