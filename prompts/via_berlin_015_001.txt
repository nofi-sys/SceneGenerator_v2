The scene is set in a restaurant, where two men are talking. One of the men, Topham, is from Missouri and is skeptical of the other man's claim that Japan is preparing for war with the United States. The other man, Stites, is certain of it, and says that the Japanese are being aided by a clever and beautiful German woman who is working against the United States. Topham is shocked to hear this, as he has recently met a German woman named Countess Elsa del Ouro Preto who he finds very attractive.
Countess Elsa enters the restaurant with a German man, and Topham is instantly drawn to her. He is so mesmerized by her beauty that he doesn't even hear what she is saying to the man she is with. Topham's glass shatters in his hand as he looks at her, and she eventually notices him. For a moment, she looks scared, but then she walks over to him and they talk. Topham is so enchanted by her that he doesn't even hear what she is saying.

The literary style of this scene is very formal and old-fashioned. It is written in third person point of view, with a focus on Topham's thoughts and emotions. The tone is one of suspense and intrigue, with a hint of romance.
