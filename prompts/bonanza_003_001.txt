Scot McClintock and his brother Hugh are on their way to Virginia City when they are attacked by Indians. Hugh is wounded, and they decide to stop in Carson for the night. Scot finds out that there is a jewellery salesman in town and persuades him to give up his seat on the stagecoach so that Hugh can have it.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the town of Carson and the people who live there.
