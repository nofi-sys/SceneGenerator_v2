The purpose of this scene is to establish the idea that the events of the story are the result of telepathy and coincidence, rather than reincarnation. The author achieves this goal by having the doctor explain to Beverton how his wife could not have been a pirate in a previous life, based on the evidence they have.

The literary style of this scene is objective, with a third-person limited point of view. The tone is scientific and detached.
