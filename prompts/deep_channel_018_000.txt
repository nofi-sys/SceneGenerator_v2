The purpose of this scene is to reveal the character of Julie and to establish the conflict in the story. Julie is a very emotional person, and she is clearly not coping well with the stress of the situation. The fact that Elizabeth was crying suggests that there is more going on than meets the eye, and that the situation with Miss Fogg is more complicated than Julie realized. This establishes the conflict in the story and sets up the tension that will drive the plot forward.

Mrs. Watkins comes to the door with news that Miss Fogg's niece has been to visit her. Julie is surprised to hear this, as she saw the niece crying as she left. Mrs. Watkins goes on to say that the niece is going to Camp Lee for a few days.
Julie is overwhelmed with relief at this news, and begins to laugh hysterically. Mrs. Watkins tries to calm her down, and eventually she does. Julie explains that she just gets this way sometimes.
