The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Jean and to contrast him with Pauline. Jean is shown to be a shy, awkward young man who is not used to the ways of Paris. Pauline is a confident, American girl who is not afraid to speak her mind. This contrast sets up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story.

The style of this scene is light and conversational. There is a hint of satire in the way Romain talks about the Americans, but overall the tone is good-natured. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Jean.

In the scene, Jean is having dinner with his uncle and aunt, Romain and Pauline. Pauline is interrogating Jean about his living arrangements and his relationship to his uncle and aunt. Jean is getting angry and tries to deflect the conversation. Pauline continues to press him and he finally snaps, telling her that it is not their custom in France to discuss their relations. Pauline turns away from him and he is left feeling embarrassed and out of place.
