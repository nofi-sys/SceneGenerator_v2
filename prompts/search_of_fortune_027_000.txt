The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is no real attempt at literary flourishes or poetic language. Instead, the focus is on clear, concise description of the events and setting. This makes the scene feel realistic and down-to-earth, rather than fanciful or romanticized.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the main characters and to establish the setting. The author also provides some background information on the history of the area and the conditions of the time.

The scene opens with the three young men, Archie, Bob, and Harry, discussing their recent successes in acquiring farms on the edge of the Darling Downs. They discuss how they each obtained their farms, and how they plan to stock and manage them. They also discuss the advantages they have in being able to purchase land and stock cheaply, and in having access to markets without having to pay high transit and freight costs.
The scene then shifts to a discussion of the work that needs to be done to clear the land and make it ready for farming. Bob expresses his desire for his wife to stay in Brisbane until he has a decent farmhouse built, and the others agree. They discuss their plans for the future and express their optimism for the success of their venture.
