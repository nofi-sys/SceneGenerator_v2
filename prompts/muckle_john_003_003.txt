In the early hours of the morning, Muckle John tells Rob that he must leave for a while, but promises to return. Rob is left alone, wounded and hungry. He sneaks into the kitchen of the house and finds a plate of cold porridge, which he devours. He then lies down in front of the fire in the hall and falls asleep.
Upstairs, Lovat is sorting through his papers. He nods off for an hour, but as dawn creeps over the country, he is still bent over his correspondence. He knows that every letter could mean his death on the scaffold.
Outside, rumours are already drifting through the village that the English are on the march towards Gortuleg. Rob Fraser steals around the premises of Gortuleg, and sees that the kennels are empty. He hears a noise from the house and sees Lovat in the doorway. Lovat is disheveled and looks like he has not slept. He asks Rob what time it is, and Rob tells him it is six o'clock. Lovat shuffles back into the house, muttering to himself.

The style of this scene is very formal and old-fashioned. It is written in third person point of view, with a focus on the character of Lovat. The tone is one of suspense and foreboding.
