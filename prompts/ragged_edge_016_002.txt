A group of men are sitting around a table in a bar, discussing recent events. They mention that Dick Nolan and Roddy Ferguson have made up, and that this could be a good thing for them. They also talk about how Larry and Rose are going to run double, and how this could be a good thing for them too. Danny Casey, who was sitting by the window, emerges from behind his newspaper and says that he heard that Dick Nolan and Roddy Ferguson had made up, and that he saw them working together against Kelly.
