The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of the Grand Duchess Aurora of Lautenburg and to provide some background information on her relationship with the protagonist. The author achieves these goals by having the protagonist recount a story in which the Grand Duchess is the heroine.

The Grand Duchess Aurora of Lautenburg is speaking to the narrator, Monsieur Brunetire, about her friend Baron von Boose. She tells him that Boose saved the life of her husband, the Grand Duke Rudolph, on two separate occasions. Brunetire is surprised to hear this, as he had previously been told that Boose was a villain. The Grand Duchess then shows him two letters from the Grand Duke, confirming the story. Brunetire is moved by the letters and the story of the Baron's heroism.

The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is somewhat detached.
