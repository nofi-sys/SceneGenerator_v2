The scene opens with a description of the bustle in Placerville, a town in California, as people hurry to prepare for a stampede to the new mining camp at Washoe. We are introduced to the driver of a canvas-covered wagon, a young man with a sullen expression and yellowish-gray eyes. He is unkempt and unshaven, and the hardships of the journey have taken their toll on his appearance.
The wagon slowly makes its way out of town, and the driver shouts a farewell to Placerville as he does. The road is in poor condition, and the going is tough for the horses pulling the wagon. The driver is forced to stop frequently to rest the horses, and he grows increasingly impatient and angry.
As the wagon approaches the mountains, the driver begins to see evidence of the stampede to Washoe in the form of abandoned wagons and supplies. He also sees a pack train of mules carrying liquor, and he comments on the fact that the only thing these people seem to be interested in is getting drunk.
Finally, the wagon reaches a region where patches of snow are visible in the hills, and the going gets even tougher. The driver beats the horses mercilessly, and at one point his wife tries to protest but he turns on her angrily.
