In the early days of Nevada, it was not uncommon for a wounded man to recover quickly due to the dry, exhilarating air. Hugh McClintock is an example of this; despite being shot through both lungs, he is soon up and about, much to the surprise of his brother Scot, who had come to visit him upon hearing news of the injury.
 Scot is amazed at Hugh's recovery, and Hugh is eager to tell him all about his adventure. He explains that he was attacked by a group of Piute Indians, but was able to make his escape by riding hard for miles. Mrs. Jessup, the ranch owner's wife who has been caring for Hugh, chimes in to say that it is a miracle he made it as far as he did, considering his injuries.
Scot is proud of his brother's resilience and tells him that he will take him back home with him as soon as he is able to travel. Hugh is eager to go, and says that he will be ready to leave the following morning.
