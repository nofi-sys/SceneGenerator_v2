- They interrogate her about why she left and if Brother Seabrook called on her to pray. 
- Julie is embarrassed and says she was just tired. 
- Old Mrs. Stover is the only one who is kind to her and offers to come check on her in the morning.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Julie and the three inquisitors. Julie is on the defensive from the start, and the author uses the dialogue to slowly reveal the reasons behind her actions. Mrs. Wicket, Miss Mary Humphries, and old Mrs. Stover all represent different aspects of small-town life that are pressuring Julie. Mrs. Wicket is the nosy busybody, Miss Mary is the religious hypocrite, and old Mrs. Stover is the well-meaning but senile relative. Together, they form a formidable force, and the author uses their interrogation to show how Julie is feeling trapped and suffocated.
