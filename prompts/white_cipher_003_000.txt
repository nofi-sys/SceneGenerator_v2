The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the main character, Chester Fay. The author achieves this by describing the London nightscape and Fay's thoughts and feelings as he walks through it.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of mystery. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is somewhat ominous.
