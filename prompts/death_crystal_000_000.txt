The scene takes place in a concrete-walled room where a group of people are horrified by a crystal they find. One man, Dave Crandall, steps forward to pick up the crystal and drop it into a pneumatic message tube. There is a blast and the crystal is gone. Crandall is relieved to learn that he has only blown up a relay station and not the administration building. DeLieb tells Crandall that he is the only living man who has seen one of the crystals in operation.
