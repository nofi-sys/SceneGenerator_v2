The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and simple. There is no real authorial voice present, and the point of view is third person limited. The tone is mostly neutral, though there is a hint of suspense or mystery in the young man's approach to Oscar.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of John Baxter and to establish his connection to Captain Badger. The author also uses this scene to establish the setting of the story and to introduce the conflict.

Oscar is on the Dutch island of Curacao, where his submarine, the Argonaut, has just arrived. He and his two friends are taking motion pictures of deep sea subjects.
While ashore, Oscar is approached by a young man named John Baxter, who tells him that he was aboard a schooner that came to Curacao to load for Boston, but fell sick and was abandoned by his captain. Baxter says he wants to get back to his home in Savannah, and asks if Oscar can help him.
Oscar agrees to help, and Baxter tells him that he learned about Captain Badger from a wireless message he overheard last night.
