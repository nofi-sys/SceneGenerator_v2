- Colonel Katy-did: an older gentleman, friend of Miss Katy-did
- Miss Katy-did: a young woman, the Colonel's cousin
- Miss Keziah Cricket: a visitor, asking for a subscription for a family of ants
- the Crickets: a family of black ants

Miss Katy is discussing with Colonel Katy-did whether or not to invite the Crickets to their upcoming social event. Miss Katy is against inviting them because they are "dreadfully plebeian" and their color is black, which she feels is inferior to green. Colonel Katy-did is surprised by this line of thinking, as he is from France where such distinctions are not made. Miss Katy explains that in America, they base social rank on color, and that it is necessary to have a class to look down upon in order to maintain elegant society. Colonel Katy-did agrees and they decide not to invite the Crickets.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the social hierarchy that exists between the different insect groups. The author does this by having the characters discuss which groups are more prestigious than others and why.
