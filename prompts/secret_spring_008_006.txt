Duke Joachim is a tractable pupil and the Grand Duke's lessons are given by a French tutor.

In the evenings, the French tutor often stays behind with the professor and Kessel, who tells stories of the Grand Duke Rudolph. The French tutor's main amusement is strolling around Lautenburg, where he enjoys watching the people and the German uniforms.
