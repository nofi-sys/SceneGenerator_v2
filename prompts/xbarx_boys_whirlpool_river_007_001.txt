A rider, dusty, hot, and tired, lopes into the ranch yard and is greeted by Sing Lung. The rider dismounts and asks for Mr. Manley, but Sing Lung tells him that he is not there. The rider says he has an important message for him and asks where he can find him. Sing Lung tells him that he is not sure, but he thinks he is at the Whirlpool River Ranch. The rider thanks him and mounts his horse to ride there.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator. The tone is mostly matter-of-fact, although there is a hint of excitement and suspense towards the end.
