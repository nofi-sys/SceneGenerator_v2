The literary style of this scene is characterized by its use of dialogue to advance the plot. The characters' emotions are conveyed through their words and actions, rather than through description. Additionally, the scene moves quickly, with short, choppy sentences.

It is 4:05pm and Annie is waiting anxiously for her husband Harry, who promised not to be later than 4pm. She hears a knock at the door and is disappointed to see that it is her brother-in-law George, who has brought William to see her. Annie tries to listen to William's excited story, but she is too preoccupied with worry for Harry. George sees the anxiety in her eyes and tells her that Harry has gone to see Stephen, and that he is sure something has happened. Annie refuses to stay behind and the three of them take a cab to Stephen's lodgings.
As they approach the house, George sees a crowd of people and a policeman outside the door. He tells Annie to wait in the cab, but she follows him closely and slips past him when he speaks to the policeman. The policeman tells them that a man has been shot and Annie realizes that it must be Harry. She runs upstairs and finds Stephen lying on the sofa. He is alive, but he tells her that Harry has not hurt him - he shot him. Annie is in shock and does not react. The doctor comes in and tells her that she can see Harry.
Harry is in the next room, sitting in a chair with his arm bandaged. Annie falls to her knees by his side, overcome with joy.
