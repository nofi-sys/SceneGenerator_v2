Adrian Schuyler and his band of American Rangers are surrounded by a group of Indians. Schuyler remains calm and collected, assessing the situation and formulating a plan. He determines that the best course of action is to charge through the enemy line. Diana, a local girl who has been watching the proceedings, offers to lead them through a path where there are no Indians. Schuyler declines, telling her that he has promised to return to General Stark's headquarters by a certain hour. Diana insists on going with them, and Adrian relents. The Rangers charge through the enemy line and escape.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Adrian Schuyler and to show the reader how he handles himself in a difficult situation. The author also wants to show the reader the difference between the American Rangers and the Indian warriors.
