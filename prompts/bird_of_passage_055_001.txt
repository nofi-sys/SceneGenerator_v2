The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Gilbert Lisle and to establish the setting of the story. The author also uses this scene to foreshadow the conflict that will arise between Helen and Darby Chute.

Two men are discussing a recent purchase Darby Chute has made. One man is Tim, and the other is his friend. They are both on their way to the courthouse. Tim is upset because he has to jury duty and his barley is still standing. His friend tells him that Darby Chute has bought a cow. Tim is surprised because Darby is poor. The friend tells him that Darby is rich now because he has been around India. Tim is surprised that Darby would notice a woman like Helen. The friend tells him that Darby is a great traveller. Helen is sitting on a creel with a pink sun-bonnet. She is listening to the conversation. The men move away and Darby Chute comes over with a companion. They are discussing a purchase. The companion is not interested in the Scotch whiskey. Darby is trying to sell the big bony cow for twenty-three pounds.

-Alannah: a young woman, presumably of lower class, who is running a cabbage stand at a market. She is described as being pretty, with a fair complexion.
-The gentleman on the horse: later revealed to be Gilbert Lisle, a wealthy man who is apparently well-known to the old crone running the next stall over. He is described as being handsome, with a grave and concentrated expression.
-The old crone: the woman running the stall next to Alannah's. She is described as being officious and greedy.
-Redmond's heir: later revealed to be Darby Chute, a man who is apparently well-known to the old crone. He is described as being a great traveller, and is said to have recently returned from India.
-Tim and his companion: two tall countrymen who are standing near Alannah's stall. Tim is described as being a juryman, and his companion is said to have met Darby Chute earlier in the day.
