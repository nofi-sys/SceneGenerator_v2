-Annie: the young wife, self-possessed and independent
-Harry: Annie's husband, violent temper
-Stephen: Harry's cousin, misshapen and weak

- Annie and Harry are sitting at breakfast and discussing Harry's plans to see her act that night. 
- Annie asks Harry to come to town with her, but he hesitates because he has something to do in town. 
- Annie persists, asking if he is going to see someone. Harry finally admits that he is going to see Stephen. 
- Annie is worried and asks what he is going to do. Harry reassures her, saying he is just going to talk to him. 
- Annie decides to go warn Stephen. Harry is reluctant to let her go, but she insists. 
- As Annie is leaving, she tells Harry that she wishes she wasn't married to him. 
- Harry is taken aback but Annie continues, saying that if she wasn't married to him, he would come with her. 
- Harry is tempted but says that Annie's words would have made him neglect his work.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Annie's husband, Harry. We learn that he is a man of strong self-control, who is not easily tempted to do something against his better judgment. This is significant because it shows that Harry is not the type of person who would be easily provoked to violence, even though he has a temper.
