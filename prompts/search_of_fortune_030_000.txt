The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is no real attempt at literary flourishes or poetic language. Instead, the focus is on telling the story in a clear and concise way. This is likely due to the fact that the scene is mostly dialogue between two characters, with very little description of the setting or action.
