The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted, likely due to the fact that it is a dialogue between several characters. The tone is somewhat tense, as the characters discuss the failed Jacobite rebellion and what their next steps should be. There is a sense of foreboding and despair among the characters, which is conveyed through their words and actions.

The scene takes place immediately after the Battle of Culloden, as the Jacobite leaders discuss their next move. Lord Lovat argues that they should make a last stand, rather than surrender to the English. Murray of Broughton argues that their army is too scattered and weak to mount another resistance, but Lochiel is ready to fight on. In the end, Lovat prevails and they decide to make a final stand.

-Lord Lovat: an old man, infirm but sharp-minded. He is the leader of the Jacobite army.
-Murray of Broughton: a Jacobite leader, shivering with illness. He is resentful of Lovat.
-Lochiel: another Jacobite leader, pale from a recent wound. He is a noble and honorable man.
-Roy Stuart: a Jacobite leader. He is pessimistic about their chances of success.
