The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Helen and to provide some background information on her current situation. The author achieves this by having Mrs. Platt visit Helen and interrogate her about her love life.

Mrs. Platt visits her niece, Helen, and tells her that she looks ill. Helen insists that she is fine, but Mrs. Platt does not believe her. She shows Helen a letter from a friend, who is looking for a governess for his daughters. The salary is good, and Mrs. Platt urges Helen to take the job.
