The style of this scene is straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is no hint of sentimentality or melodrama. The characters are shown as they really are, without any attempt to idealize them.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Bardwell Manley and to introduce the conflict of the story. Mr. Manley is shown to be a fair and just man, even to his enemies, and the conflict is established as the search for the stolen horses.

The scene opens with Teddy Manley trying to chase down a puncher who has disappeared through a side door in Rimor's Place, a restaurant in Eagles, NM. Teddy's father and two brothers, Roy and Pop, have been in a scuffle with the puncher and the barkeeper inside the restaurant.
Outside, a small crowd has gathered, including Nick and Gus Tripp, two cowboys who work for the Manleys. Teddy tells them that the puncher got away and Nick says they didn't see anything.
Gus is skeptical of the Manleys' explanation for the commotion and asks if the puncher was the one doing the yelling. Teddy says no, it was the barkeeper.
Nick nods approvingly and Mr. Manley says they should be getting on. They can't get any information in Eagles.
