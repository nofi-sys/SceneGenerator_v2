Amy and Jessie are sitting in Jessie's room listening to a concert from Stratfordtown when they are interrupted by Mr. Norwood and Mr. Drew. The men discuss a court case involving Belle's father and another man, New Melford Ringold. Jessie and Amy are only interested in the concert, but they listen to the men's conversation. Mr. Norwood says that Ringold is a note shaver and he won't risk much to make a bad claim good. The girls go back to listening to the concert, which is interrupted by a talk on economics. Amy is bored by the talk and goes to find Jessie. She trills for Jessie under the radio-room windows and Jessie comes out to play with her.
