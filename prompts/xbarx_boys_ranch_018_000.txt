The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Gilly Froud and to create suspense. The author achieves these goals by having Froud hold a gun on Roy and threaten to kill him if he makes any sudden moves. This makes Froud appear to be a dangerous and unpredictable character, which increases the suspense of the scene.

In the scene, Roy is being held at gunpoint by Gilly Froud, a rustler. Froud is demanding to know what Roy knows about a man in a checkered shirt, and Roy is trying to stall for time. Suddenly, Teddy, Roy's brother, appears riding slowly past the grove. Froud orders Roy to be quiet and not to move, or he will shoot him. Roy recognizes the desperate ring in the rustlers voice and knows that the least move on his part would result in his death. Froud is seized with a sort of panic, and at the slightest sign from Teddy that the latter knew of his brothers plight, the rascal would start shooting. As Roy sees his brother pass out of sight, he feels the pressure of the gun at his side relax, and Froud unconsciously sighs with relief. Froud then tells Roy that he is taking no chances and orders him not to talk until he says so. A moment later, the sound of Teddy's horse dies away in the distance. Froud declares that Teddy is gone and orders Roy not to try anything funny. Roy asks why Froud is being so touchy and suggests that he let him ride on and try to find the thieves who took Bug Eyes' flivver. Froud tells Roy that it is none of his business and that he has not forgotten how Roy's father kicked him off the X Bar X.
