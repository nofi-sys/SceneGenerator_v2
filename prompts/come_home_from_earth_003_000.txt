The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two main characters: Ellis, who wants to remember his past life on the planet Aarl, and Burke, who is skeptical of Ellis's claims. Ellis is eager to try again, despite the risks, in order to remember more about Aarl. Burke is doubtful that Ellis will be able to remember anything more, and is also concerned about the risks involved.
