The style of this scene is suspenseful and mysterious. The narrator is omniscient, and the reader is given information that the protagonist is not privy to. This creates a sense of tension and anticipation, as the reader wonders what will happen next.

The scene takes place in a library, where the protagonist has been studying. He is interrupted by the arrival of Cyrus Beck, who is also working on a secret project. Beck quickly leaves, and the protagonist is left alone in the library.
He takes the opportunity to search for a vital document, and soon finds what he's looking for - a bill from Giroud, a locksmith, dated 1682. The bill includes an item for the chimney-place in the Baron's Hall, which has six lettered locks.
The protagonist realizes that the same system is likely used in the armoury of the castle of Lautenburg, and decides to test his theory. He goes to the armoury and finds the chimney-place, but is disappointed to see that there are only two locks, not six.
He tries the first lock, and to his amazement, it opens. He tries the second lock, and it also opens. A black vertical line appears in the centre of the plaque, and the two panels slide back to reveal a hidden passage.
The protagonist has solved the mystery of the Herrenhausen.
