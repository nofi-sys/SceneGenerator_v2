The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The tone is one of anger and frustration, and the point of view is that of the third-person omniscient narrator.

Mr Crampton and Mr Hindes are partners in a wool-stapling business. Mr Crampton is upset because his daughter has been spending time with a young man named Frederick Walcheren, who is a Catholic. Mr Hindes tries to reassure Mr Crampton that he will speak to Mr Walcheren and convince him to stop pursuing Jenny.

- Mrs Crampton: Jenny's mother, a meek woman who is easily controlled by her daughter
- Miss Bostock (Aunt Clem): Mrs Crampton's sister, also meek
- Mr Crampton: Jenny's father, a stern man with strong views
- Mr Walcheren: Jenny's suitor, a young man from a wealthy family
- Mr Hindes: Mr Crampton's business partner, a younger man who is more polished than his partner
