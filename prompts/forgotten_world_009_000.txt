Laird Carlin is a child of a galactic civilization in which violence is rare. He is stunned when he sees Loesser, an Earthman, with an atom-pistol intending to kill him. Harb and Jonny Land come running forward and Jonny explains that they are just planning an expedition to Mercury to prospect for copper and that they are just being secretive about their plans. Carlin goes back to the veranda of the old house and ponders what he saw. He gets a premonition that something is off about the machine he saw in the workshop.
