The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Captain Raggett and to set up the conflict between him and the two American ship captains. The author achieves this by having the captain give a speech in which he explains his leniency in the past and his determination to be more strict in the future. This sets up the conflict between the two sides and establishes Raggett as a firm and unyielding character.
