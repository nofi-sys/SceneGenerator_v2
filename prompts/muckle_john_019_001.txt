The scene takes place in a small room in a cottage by the shore of a loch in the Scottish Highlands. The time is twilight, and a small boat can be seen approaching the shore. 
Inside the cottage, a large man called Muckle John is singing a sad song called "The Glen of Tears." The song is about the passing of time and the sorrows of life. The Mackenzies, a family of Scottish highlanders, are listening to the song. They are a rough and dangerous bunch, and their leader, Neil, is a scoundrel. 
Muckle John is playing a tune called "The Dance of the Mackenzies" on his whistle. The tune is a lively one, but there is something strange about it. The Mackenzies are starting to feel uneasy. Suddenly, Muckle John runs towards the door. The thatched roof of the cottage is on fire, and Neil Mackenzie tries to stop him, but Muckle John stabs him in the arm with a dirk and runs out. 
The Mackenzies try to follow him, but he fights them off with his claymore, a large two-handed sword. He drives them back into the cottage, where the smoke is dense and black. From inside, Neil Mackenzie calls out to him to stop. Muckle John ignores him and continues to sing. 
Suddenly, the boat that was approaching the shore turns around and heads back out to sea. Muckle John has won.

The literary style of this scene is very dramatic. There is a lot of tension between the characters, and the reader is kept guessing about what is going to happen next. The point of view is from the perspective of the Mackenzies, and the tone is one of suspense and fear.
