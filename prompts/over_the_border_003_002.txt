The scene opens with a woman, Grace, speaking to a man, Jack. She tells him that she saw him getting the best of her brother and asks if he turned in an alarm. Jack tells her that he did, but her brother got away before the firemen came. He was arrested for causing the fire, but he served five years in Trenton prison rather than call on Grace to clear his name. Grace is shocked and horrified by this revelation. She asks why he didn't tell her and he says that he didn't want to ask her to save him at her brother's expense. The bitterness between them fades and they share a moment of tenderness before Jack goes back to his room. The next day, Grace comes to him and tells him that her brother has admitted to starting the fire. She also says that she is through with her brother and will be staying in the United States when they return home. Jack agrees not to tell the captain about her brother's condition unless it becomes necessary.

The style of this scene is intense and dramatic. The point of view is first person, and the tone is angry and bitter. There is a lot of dialogue, which reveals the characters' emotions and thoughts.
