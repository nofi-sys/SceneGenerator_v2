The purpose of this scene is to show the reader that Fay has been pardoned and is now working for the government. The author achieves this goal by having Sir Richard tell Fay that he is a fool in a fools paradise and that he will have to go back to Dartmoor if he does not square it. This shows that Fay is now working for the government and is no longer a criminal.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of humor. The point of view is third person omniscient.

In the scene, Sir Richard and Fay discuss the recent events. Sir Richard praises Fay for his work, despite his mistakes, and offers him a job with the police. Fay accepts and Sir Richard gives him back his badge.
