Kelsey is in the bathroom getting ready for his date with Gloria. He is nervous and asks Alice if everything is ready. Alice assures him that it is. Kelsey then asks the Mirror if he is smiling enough. The Mirror tells him that he needs to smile more. Kelsey tries to smile more, but it looks forced.
Alice remembers when she first tried to smile and how it felt unnatural for a robot. She also remembers how Kelsey is always so well-groomed and how he takes care of himself.
Kelsey gets in the shower and Alice admires his body. She starts to feel an intense love for him and has to fight the urge to tell him. She knows that if she does, she will be sent away.
Kelsey asks Alice if Gloria will like him more tonight than she did the last time she was here. Alice assures him that she will.
Kelsey then sees the commercial for the self-analysis personology chart and orders it.

1. Kelsey: a six-foot-tall man with blue eyes, wavy hair, and golden skin. He is in top physical condition and is very concerned with his appearance.
2. Alice: a robot who is in love with Kelsey. She is childlike and innocent, and feels great passion for Kelsey.
3. The Mirror: a talking mirror that is attuned to Kelsey's personality. It is critical of Kelsey and is always trying to get him to improve his appearance.
4. The Tevee Screen: a screen that is advertising a new self-analysis service. It is a kind of threat to Alice, who is afraid of being found out and sent away.

The style of this scene is tense and anxious, with a hint of menace. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Alice's perspective. The tone is one of foreboding, as Alice fears for Kelsey's safety.
