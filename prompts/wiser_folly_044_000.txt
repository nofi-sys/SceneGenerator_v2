In the scene, Antony confronts Louisa about her earlier remark that he is "nobody particular" now that he is no longer Sir Antony. Antony argues that he must be somebody, to which Louisa replies that everyone is somebody but that it doesn't mean they're important. Antony then asks what "importance" is, and Louisa explains that he was important when he was Sir Antony but that now he is of no more account than a beggar boy. Antony is visibly upset by this, and the scene ends with him in a state of resentment.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Antony and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. Antony is established as a proud, sensitive boy who takes things very seriously. The reader can see that he is going to be upset by Louisa's casual remark and that this will cause problems for him later on.

The style of this scene is conversational and matter-of-fact. There is a hint of sarcasm in Louisa's tone, but overall the tone is neutral. The point of view is third person omniscient.
