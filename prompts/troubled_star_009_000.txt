Scyth and Dusty are discussing the establishment of a beacon at Sol, which will help chart a course through a dangerous rift in space. Dusty is reluctant to allow this, as it will mean that the star will become a three-day variable, which is too unstable for any life to exist under. However, Scyth points out that they have no choice in the matter, as there is no other star that would work as a beacon.

Scyth: a member of the space patrol who is trying to explain to Dusty why they need to use Sol as a beacon. He is patient and reasonable, but Dusty is not convinced.
Dusty: the owner of the ship who is suspicious of Scyth and doesn't want him on board. He is gruff and doesn't want to listen to reason.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its use of dialogue to advance the plot. The tone is tense and slightly hostile, as the two characters debate the merits of using Sol as a beacon for the space lanes. The point of view is limited to Dusty's perspective.
