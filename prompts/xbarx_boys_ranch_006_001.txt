The purpose of this scene is to create suspense and tension as the boys search for the rustlers. The author achieves this by making the boys tired and hungry, and by having them chase the rustlers through dangerous terrain.

Teddy and Roy are chasing rustlers who have stolen their horses. They are deep in the forest, and the going is tough. Teddy is starting to feel weak from hunger and lack of food.
Suddenly, they hear a strange buzzing sound. It is coming from a large gray boulder that has a deep gash running from one end to the other. Teddy and Roy dismount and approach the boulder cautiously.
They realize that the sound is coming from a huge swarm of bees that has taken up residence in the gash. Teddy and Roy are both deathly afraid of bees, and they quickly mount their horses and ride away as fast as they can.
They are relieved to have escaped the bees, but they are now even more tired and hungry. They decide to head back to the path and try to find their way back to their father.
