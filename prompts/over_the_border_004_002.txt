1. protagonist: a man, angry and jealous, who is trying to win back the affections of a woman who is now with another man
2. the woman: kind, gentle, and sorrowful, with no will of her own
3. Dartmoor: the man who has taken the woman away, and who seems to have some sort of influence over her
4. Mr. Pfeffer: a seagoing missionary who has been shipwrecked and taken in by the protagonist
5. the monstrosity: a strange creature that Dartmoor has been experimenting on
6. Dartmoor's two servants: men who do not like the quiet life on the island and have asked to be taken away
7. Ella: the woman who is now with Dartmoor, and who the protagonist is trying to win back

- protagonist is happy to have found a way to keep the woman he loves away from Dartmoor, even if it means marooning him on an island
- the missionary who is also stranded on the island is eager to help with the "new-born intelligence"
- the two servants who were left with Dartmoor ask to be taken off the island, which the protagonist does
- upon returning to the island, the protagonist hears a strange noise coming from the house

The style of this scene is rather dark and sinister. The narrator is clearly jealous of Dartmoor and has a sinister plan to get rid of him. The tone is tense and foreboding, and the point of view is from the first person perspective of the narrator.
