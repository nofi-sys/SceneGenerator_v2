- Lissa and Nathan are on the old overland route, and come across a ridge of earth that was probably made by emigrants being attacked by Indians.
- Lissa is imagining what it would be like to see a band of Indians on a war expedition, and shivers at the thought.
- They reach a small town and Lissa is surprised by how pleasant it looks after days of uninhabited wilds.
- The next morning, they start early and Lissa suddenly realizes she's been there before in a dream.
- They come to the place she described and Lissa remembers that it is the place where a white man was flayed alive by Indians.
