The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Bob and Harry, and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story.

Bob and Harry are two miners who have been working a claim in a remote area. They have been quite successful, amassing a small fortune in gold dust and nuggets. However, their claim suddenly dries up and they decide to pack up and head back to civilization.
They pack their gold into saddlebags and set off on horseback. A few nights into their journey, they make camp in a small hut. They are soon joined by their faithful dog, Wango.
Bob and Harry are just falling asleep when they are suddenly awoken by the sound of a gunshot. They see a man in the hut and Harry grabs his revolver and starts firing. The man is hit and falls to the ground. Harry then chases the other man, who is also armed, out of the hut.
Harry catches up to the man, who he recognizes as Vance, and starts to beat him. Vance is soon unconscious and Harry returns to the hut to check on Bob.
Bob has been shot in the arm and is bleeding heavily. Harry helps him to bandage the wound and then goes to get help from their neighbors.
A few men come to the hut and Bob is soon taken to the nearest town for medical treatment. He makes a full recovery and the two men are able to return to their claim and continue mining.

The style of this scene is very colloquial and conversational. The tone is light and humorous, despite the violence of the story. The point of view is first person, from the perspective of Johnnie.
