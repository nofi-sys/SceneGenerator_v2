The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Monson and to provide some background information about him. The author also introduces the concept of mesmerism and establishes the professor as an expert in this area.

A doctor leads a professor and a bald man into a small room containing a bed, a washstand, and one chair. The doctor explains that the bald man is intelligent and sensitive, but has lost his memory and has a strange antipathy to cats and dogs. As if on cue, a huge cat bounds into the room, followed by the bald man who begins to chase it. The cat escapes and the bald man is restrained by the doctor and nurse. The doctor orders a bench or pail for the bald man to sit on, and the professor begins to mesmerize him. The bald man falls into a trance and the professor begins to pull his hair and command him to stare into his eyes.
