At Bells Camp, a boy on horseback arrives leading two other saddled horses. He stops in front of the Budd house, from which three people emerge in answer to his whistle. The lookout in the shadow of the blacksmith shop leans forward to peer into the failing light. First comes a huge, shambling man, hairy and bearded, with his hands tied together in front of him. At his heels walks a straight, lithe figure recognized instantly by the watcher as McClintock. The deputy carries a revolver. A young woman in riding dress brings up the rear.
McClintock hands his revolver to the woman after he has helped her mount. He adjusts the stirrups of all the saddles, then hurries the group away. The watcher up the street reports their departure to a group of horsemen, who set off in pursuit.
Half a mile up the caon, Hugh stops to free Budd's hands. They listen for a moment, then Hugh says, "Our anxious friends aren't losin' any time." They continue riding through a rough, basaltic landscape. A rabbit scurries past them, and the scent of sage is strong in the air.
Vicky is excited by the adventure, and thrilled by the occasional contact with Hugh as they ride side by side. She knows that he is attracted to her, and feels a strange, reluctant dread that her feelings for him will be put to the test.
They are met by a group of armed men who order them to raise their hands in the air. Hugh tells Vicky not to move, then speaks up to the men, saying that they must have the wrong group. The men don't believe him, but when they step closer to investigate, they realize that Dutch is not with them. They apologize and ride off.
