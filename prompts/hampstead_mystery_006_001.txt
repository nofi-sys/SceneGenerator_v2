His wife is a woman who is trying to understand his inner conflict and to support him.

- Henry Hindes has been trying to find Jenny Walcheren to convince her to reconcile with her parents
- He has been unsuccessful and is now on his way home
- His wife, Hannah, is sympathetic and tells him that the Cramptons (Jenny's parents) were over earlier
- Henry is surprised to hear this and asks what they said
- Hannah tells him that they are not as angry with Jenny as her father is and that they think he will eventually forgive her
- Henry is relieved to hear this and takes a brandy-and-soda

The literary style of this scene is very formal. The tone is polite but strained, and the point of view is limited to what Henry Hindes can see and hear. There is a lot of dialogue, which gives the reader a sense of what the characters are thinking and feeling.
