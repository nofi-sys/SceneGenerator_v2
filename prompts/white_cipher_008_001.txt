A soldier shouts something as a small car drives quickly over the cobblestones and into the one street of the town. Fay, who is in the car, leans out and sees that the tires are made of sections of rubber hose bound with wire and rope. He realizes that this is because of England's embargo on imported goods. The Dutch boy driving the car speeds through the town and Fay holds tight to the seat, trying to see through the cracked windshield. They pass low barns and houses and eventually reach the quays of the city. Fay tells the boy to stop and hands him two sovereigns, telling him to buy new tires. He hurries off, planning to break into the embassy building. He recalls a similar job he did in Paris, where he broke into a vault, and is confident he can do the same here. He knows that a German crook named Dutch Gus is also planning to break into the embassy, and he is determined to beat him to it.
