The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to provide information about the protagonist, Roy Manley. The author achieves this by having Roy wake up and slowly remember where he is and what has happened to him.

- Roy Manley wakes up disoriented, with a headache and a sprained ankle, on an island in the middle of a river
- He has no memory of how he got there, but slowly pieces together that he and his friends were in a canoe that capsized
- He assumes that his friends have all drowned, but hopes that his friend Teddy, who was a strong swimmer, has made it to shore

The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person limited point of view. The tone is mostly matter-of-fact, though there is a hint of suspense and fear when Roy wonders what has happened to his companions.
