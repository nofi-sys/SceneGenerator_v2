The narrator proceeds towards a rotunda, where he sees a beautiful group in a fountain, illuminated by the moon. The rest of the hall is in shadow. He enters the other gallery and finds it deserted, but he can hear music coming from the rear. The music is sweet and plaintive, and the narrator is enchanted by it. He realizes that the music is coming from the fountain, and he watches as the water flows in an irregular and intermittent manner, causing the music to change in intensity.
The narrator remembers that Madame d'Ionis had told him that the music was out of order, and that sometimes it played by itself for several minutes. This does not prevent him from enjoying the music, and he is grateful that the fountain has reserved its music for him alone.
Suddenly, the narrator sees the statue of the naiad move. He is not sure at first if it is a trick of the light, but he soon realizes that there is a real being standing next to the statue. The being is exactly like the statue, and the narrator is not afraid. He admires the being's beauty and grace.
The being descends the steps of the monument and approaches the narrator. The narrator stretches out his arms to seize the being, but it seems as if the being is about to leap over a height of from five to six feet which still separates them.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the reader to the protagonist. The author achieves this by describing the protagonist's surroundings in detail and by providing information about the protagonist's thoughts and feelings.
