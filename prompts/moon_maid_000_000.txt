The style of this scene is formal and objective. The narrator is third-person limited, focusing on the thoughts and actions of the protagonist. There is a sense of detachment in the way the events are described.

In the year 1967, a message is sent from Mars to Earth, dated Helium, Barsoom. The message is a simple greeting, but it is the beginning of communication between the two planets.
On the same day, in the Blue Room of The Harding, a group of people are celebrating the event. Among them is the protagonist, who is sitting with a fellow diner. The fellow diner is a fighting man, and the two of them begin to talk about the message from Mars. The fighting man says that he envies the ignorance of the people celebrating, because they do not know what is to come. He says that he has seen things that he cannot explain or understand, and that he knows from personal observation that there is no such thing as time.
The fighting man is interrupted by a young woman who is dancing on a table nearby. He comments that she is not being careful and is in danger of falling. The protagonist offers to show the fighting man to his room, where he can rest. The fighting man accepts, and as they are leaving, he and the young woman exchange a look of recognition.
