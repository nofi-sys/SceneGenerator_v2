The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no emotional language or description, and the focus is on the events unfolding. The point of view is third person omniscient.

The purpose of this scene is to provide an overview of the events that have transpired and to set up the climax of the story. The author achieves this by having the character Vignerte recount the events leading up to the climax, and by having a runner come to tell the protagonist that he is needed at the commandant's headquarters.
