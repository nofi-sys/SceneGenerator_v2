Muckle John and a small band of defenders are holding a pass against a large group of soldiers. The soldiers are armed with muskets and are slowly driving the defenders back. Muckle John suddenly calls for claymores, and charges the soldiers with his great sword. The defenders manage to push the soldiers back, but two more men are lost in the process.
Muckle John is wounded in the ankle by a bullet, but he refuses to leave his post. The two remaining defenders, Grant and Macpherson, try to convince him to leave, but he refuses. The soldiers begin to advance again, and Muckle John screams at the two men to leave. They finally do, but Muckle John watches them go with wistful eyes.
The soldiers begin to creep up the passageway, but Muckle John is ready for them. He and Rob stand side by side, swords in hand, and manage to kill two of the soldiers. The soldiers retreat and Muckle John begins to play the "Battle of the Clans" on his chanter.
The soldiers wait in fear, but Captain Strange finally rallies them and they begin to creep up again. Muckle John and Rob manage to kill four more soldiers before the soldiers retreat again. This time, Muckle John plays the "Lament for the Children" on his chanter.
The soldiers creep up again, but this time they are met with a hail of bullets from Muckle John's pistol. One soldier is hit and screams as he falls down the slope. The soldiers retreat again and Muckle John and Rob prepare to defend the pass one last time.
