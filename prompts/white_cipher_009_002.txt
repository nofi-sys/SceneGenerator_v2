The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the conflict. The author achieves this by describing the murky, foggy setting and by introducing the police dragnet that is looking for Fay and Saidee.

Fay and Saidee are trying to escape the police by boat. Fay is rowing and Saidee is in the stern. The fog is thick and they can barely see. Fay says they're getting on and that they'll make it. Saidee is worried about the police finding them. Fay reassures her and says he's going to take the cipher-key to Sir Richard. They land and Fay kicks the boat out. They walk through the fog and eventually make it to safety.
