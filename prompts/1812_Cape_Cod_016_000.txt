The scene takes place on a schooner in the middle of a storm. The pilot, Hoppy Mayo, tells the captain, Dunton, that there is a small inlet to the south of them that they might be able to reach if they lose their anchor. Dunton is worried because they only have one anchor and it is not very strong. Hoppy tells him that they will have to try for the inlet if the anchor gives way.
Suddenly, the anchor does give way and the schooner starts to drift towards the shore. Dunton orders the crew to start rowing, but it is too late. The schooner hits the rocks and starts to sink. Dunton and the crew manage to get into a lifeboat and they are eventually rescued.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Dunton and Hoppy, and to set up the conflict between them. Dunton is presented as a competent and level-headed sailor, while Hoppy is shown to be reckless and self-serving. The scene also establishes the stakes of the conflict, with Dunton's life and the lives of his crew depending on Hoppy's skill as a pilot.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by a tense, suspenseful tone, as the characters await the outcome of the storm. The point of view is third person limited, focused on the thoughts and experiences of Captain Dunton. There is a sense of foreboding and dread throughout the scene, as the characters are aware of the danger they are in.
