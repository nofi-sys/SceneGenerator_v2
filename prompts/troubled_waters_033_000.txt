The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a focus on telling the story of Ruth's fight to get her husband pardoned. There is a touch of drama, but overall the tone is fairly positive and optimistic. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Ruth's perspective.

Ruth and her attorney appear before the board of pardons for the fourth time, and this time they are successful. Governor McDowell calls Ruth to tell her that Rowan and his three friends are to be paroled, and that he is considering a full pardon for Rowan.
