The style of this scene is light and satirical. The author is making fun of the guests and their behavior. The tone is one of amusement, and the point of view is third person omniscient.

- Madame Torialli suggests to Louis that they have supper instead of waiting for the Revue. 
- The guests rally a little under the approach of food. 
- The princes come in rather sulkily, but as they find some particular friends in the dining-room they recover enough to behave a little worse than anyone had quite expected. 
- A famous _danseuse_ who had just arrived was quite shocked; she was accustomed to quieter manners. 
- Una and the Lion, the Marquis de Trvaillant pointed out to Romain DUcelles. 
- Romain lifted his eyebrows and looked at Madame Torialli. 
- Jean overheard his uncle and hated him. He felt that he must speak or die. 
- Madame Torialli is trying to save the situation, my uncle, he said stiffly. 
- Romain laughed. 
- What can I do? What can I do? moaned the distracted Louis. 
- The Revue began in the most brilliant manner; everybody on the stage was anxious, self-conscious, and jealous; every one in the audience was amused. 
- Prince Ivan and Prince Rudolph fulfilled every ones expectation of the absurd. 
- The _femmes du monde_ danced beautifully; at least they wore practically nothing and moved about the stage very gracefully while some one was playing the piano.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the guests and the scene in the dining room.
