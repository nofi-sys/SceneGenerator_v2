The literary style of this scene is characterized by its third-person point of view, its focus on Hugh McClintock's thoughts and emotions, and its use of descriptive language to set the scene and establish the mood.

Hugh McClintock is a third owner of the Ground Hog mine, and he is also a contractor and teamster in the new mining camp of Bald Knob. He is very busy, but he is also the unofficial father of the camp, and so people are always coming to him with their problems.
On this afternoon, a barefoot Negro boy comes to him with a note from Vicky Lowell. The note says that she needs to see him, and it is very important.
Hugh knows that if Vicky says it is important, then it must be. He also knows that she is a proud woman who would never call him away from his work unless it was absolutely necessary. He begins to wonder if perhaps she has developed feelings for him.
He tries to push these thoughts out of his head, knowing that Vicky would never make the first move. He knows that he would have to make any advances himself.
He is finally able to leave his office and head to the schoolhouse, but he is now 15 minutes late. He wonders what could be so important that she would need to see him urgently.

The purpose of this scene is to establish Hugh's character and to set up the conflict of the story. Hugh is a busy man who is in love with Vicky Lowell. Vicky has called him to the schoolhouse to talk to him about something important, but he is late because he was detained by business matters.
