Dudley Baker: a thin, elongated 15-year-old boy; red-faced from embarrassment
Star Meyer: a haughty, muscular boy; easily and gracefully doing the calisthenics
Jimmy: a sturdy, stocky boy; loafing a bit when Mr. Sargent's gaze is not on him

-Dudley Baker is a 15-year-old high school student who is trying out for the school's baseball team.
-He is embarrassed when the team's manager, Barnes, asks him his age and weight in front of everyone.
-Later, his friend Jimmy tells him that he thinks he should pick a fight with Star Meyer, another player who has been making fun of him.
-Dud is not a very good fighter, but he decides to try to bluff Star into not fighting.
-It works, and Dud feels better about himself.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is some dialogue, but it is mostly exposition. The tone is somewhat tense and uncomfortable, as Dud is embarrassed and does not want to fight Star. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Dud.
