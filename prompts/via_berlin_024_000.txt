The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Ouro Preto and Miss Byrd, and to set up the conflict between them. The author achieves this by having Ouro Preto try to court Miss Byrd, who is clearly not interested.

- Ouro Preto is leaning on the deck of the ship, Southern Cross, making his way to a chair by Lillian Byrd's side. 
- Lillian Byrd sees him coming and feels a mix of triumph (at the success of her quiet, effective work to gain certain knowledge from him) and contrition. 
- Ouro Preto sits down in the chair and tells Lillian that he loves her and can offer her much, including a duchess title, position, rank, and fame. 
- Lillian Byrd forces a laugh and tells him that she is not the inexperienced girl he thinks she is.

-Ouro Preto: A wealthy young man, of Brazilian and German descent. He is the head of a great movement, and is about to be made a duke.
-Lillian Byrd: An American girl, who is bored and irritated by the long voyage. She is also experienced enough to know that no woman should feel sympathy or friendship for Ouro Preto.
