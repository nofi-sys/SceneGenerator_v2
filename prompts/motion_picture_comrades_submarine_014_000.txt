The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator describing the events and setting. There is a bit of dialogue between the characters, but mostly the narrator is describing the events as they unfold. The tone is fairly neutral, though there is a sense of excitement and anticipation as the characters wait to see what treasures they will find.
