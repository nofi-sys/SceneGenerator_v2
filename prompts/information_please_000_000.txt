The style of this scene is journalistic, with a touch of humor. The point of view is third person omniscient.

Sassoon is a politician who has seized control of a machine called the Solver, which is a super-brain that can answer any question. The scientists who built the Solver are upset because they believe it should remain under scientific control, not political. Professor Connor, the inventor of the Solver, is killed in a car crash. Sassoon announces that the Solver will be unveiled to the public with due ceremony, come Wednesday. The scientists are invited to attend, but they are not happy about it.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the Solver, a machine which can answer any question, and to the conflict between its inventor, Professor Connor, and the politician Sassoon. The scene also sets up the events of the following day, when the Solver is unveiled to the public.
