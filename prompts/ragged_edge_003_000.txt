The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the conflict. The conflict is between Larry Murphy and the women in the court. Larry is trying to keep a low profile and the women are gossiping about him.

-Mrs. Nolan: A red-faced, bare-armed woman who threw a pan of garbage into the gutter.
-Mrs. Burns: Mrs. Nolan's next door neighbor who was walking up and down the narrow strip of sidewalk, hushing the cry of a weazened baby.
-Jerry: A young man who was sitting on a feed-box in the doorway polishing a set of light harness.
-The group of dirty children: A group of children who were playing under an up-tilted cart.
-The two starving curs: A brace of starving curs who fought savagely up the alley over a mouldy bone.
-Johnnie Kerrigan: The son of the local saloon-keeper.
-Contractor McGlory: The owner of the stables and cart sheds.
-Old Larry Murphy: A crusty old man who went from door to door down the court collecting rent.
-Kellys: A man who is after the court.
-The drunken man: A man who passed the end of the court and pitched into the gutter.
-Young Larry Murphy: The son of Old Larry Murphy.

Mrs. Nolan and Mrs. Burns are gossiping in their courtyard when they see Jerry, the stable boy, preparing to go for a drive. Mrs. Nolan comments on how early it is for Jerry to be driving on a Sunday morning. Jerry says he's just going for a spin and wants to try out a new skate he bought.
The conversation turns to Johnnie Kerrigan, the son of the local tavern owner, who has just been seen entering the house of their mutual enemy, old Larry Murphy. Both women are shocked at this news.
Mrs. Nolan and Mrs. Burns discuss how terrible old Murphy is, and how he would never forgive them if they couldn't pay their rent on time. They also mention Kelly, another landlord who is trying to evict them from their homes.
Suddenly, they see young Larry Murphy standing on the steps of Murphy's house. He looks over at the women and swears at them before going inside.
The women are surprised and confused by this turn of events.
