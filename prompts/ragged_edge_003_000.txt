Mrs. Nolan and Mrs. Burns are gossiping in their courtyard when they see Jerry, the stable boy, preparing to go for a drive. Mrs. Nolan comments on how early it is for Jerry to be driving on a Sunday morning. Jerry says he's just going for a spin and wants to try out a new skate he bought.
The conversation turns to Johnnie Kerrigan, the son of the local tavern owner, who has just been seen entering the house of their mutual enemy, old Larry Murphy. Both women are shocked at this news.
Mrs. Nolan and Mrs. Burns discuss how terrible old Murphy is, and how he would never forgive them if they couldn't pay their rent on time. They also mention Kelly, another landlord who is trying to evict them from their homes.
Suddenly, they see young Larry Murphy standing on the steps of Murphy's house. He looks over at the women and swears at them before going inside.
The women are surprised and confused by this turn of events.
