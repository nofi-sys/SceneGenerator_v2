The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of the Bengalee zemindar and to establish his back story. The author also uses the scene to contrast the zemindar's tragic memories with the carefree attitudes of the other characters.

A group of young men are on the pier at Ross, discussing the recent absence of many of the island's residents. Among them is a tall, gaunt Bengalee man who is a zemindar from Oude. He is lost in thought, remembering his native village and the events of twenty years ago that led to his imprisonment. The men are joined by two others who have been out fishing and are laden with their catch. The group talks and laughs, unaware of the tragic memories of the Bengalee man.
