The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Julian and Nah-ee-lah, and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. Julian is a practical, level-headed Earthman, while Nah-ee-lah is a impulsive, emotional native of the planet Va-nah. Julian is immediately attracted to Nah-ee-lah, but is worried that her feelings for him are too strong and that she will not be able to think straight when it comes to finding her way home. Nah-ee-lah, on the other hand, is confident that she will be able to find Laythe, her home planet, and is not worried about the dangers they face. This scene also establishes the setting, which is a hostile, dangerous planet.
