In February 1909, a young woman is shooting ducks from a boat on the Volga River when she sees her father's Cossack signaling to her from the bank. The Cossack tells her that the Prince (her father) wants her in his study. When she arrives, her father shows her a letter from the Czar informing him that Emperor William is visiting St. Petersburg in May and that there will be a review at Tsarskoe-Selo. The Czar requests that the Astrakhan and Aral Cossacks be represented, and the Tumene Prince is to bring a brigade. The Czarina adds that she would like to make her little niece's acquaintance on this occasion. 
The young woman is excited at the prospect of going to Paris and seeing the Emperor. She spends days looking in the mirror, anticipating how she will impress everyone. She orders a new wardrobe from a fashionable French dressmaker, and when she returns to Astrakhan to collect it, she tells her father that she can find nothing suitable. She weeps and tells him she would rather die than be seen in public like a savage. Her father relents and they soon depart for Paris. 
Upon their arrival, the young woman is determined to make a good impression. She is cold and aloof with everyone she meets, and orders an extravagant wardrobe from the fashionable dressmaker Doucet. She also flirts with an old gentleman she meets at a restaurant, much to her father's dismay.

The style of this scene is light and humorous. The narrator has a light, sarcastic tone, and the point of view is third person limited.
