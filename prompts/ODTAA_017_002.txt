The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact, almost journalistic. There is a sense of urgency and tension, but it is conveyed through simple, straightforward language. There is a bit of foreshadowing with the mention of the snake, which creates a sense of unease.

- Hi: protagonist, looking for a horse to borrow
- the hostess: unhelpful about horses
- the hare: sick and praying
- the snake: Hi drives it away with stones
- the South German: friendly and helpful, takes Hi to the old farm
- the negress: takes Hi to see the old woman
- the old woman: fat, old, sitting in a tall-backed red chair

Hi is looking for a horse to borrow so he can continue on his journey. He meets a friendly young man who tells him there are no horses available, but he may be able to borrow a colt from the old woman across the road. Hi goes to the old woman's house and she lets him borrow the colt.
