- Jane: Crandall's girlfriend, who is also working on the secret project with him. She is supportive and care for him.
- Dave: a pseudonym for Crandall, who is pretending to be a physicist in order to fool the enemy. He is clever and quick-witted.
- The enemy: an unknown force that is trying to sabotage the secret project. They are cunning and resourceful.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of humor. The point of view is first person, from Dave's perspective. The tone is one of determination and resolve.

Dave is in the remote lab, preparing to test the crystal. He is sure that the people on the other side can see and hear him, but he doesn't think they can read minds. He is about to start the test when Jane comes in.
