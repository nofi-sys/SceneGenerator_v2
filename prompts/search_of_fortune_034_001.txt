The scene is of a kangaroo hunt, with men and dogs chasing the animals. The blacks are excited and enjoy the bloodshed. Archie is not content with the sport, and after a while he and Harry go to find Miss Winslow. They find her near their horses, and she tells them she is not interested in the hunt. Craig then arrives and they all mount their horses. The hounds soon find a kangaroo, and they have a wild ride chasing it. The kangaroo is eventually killed, and they all return to farmer Findlayson's house for dinner. The soup is made from the tail of the kangaroo.
