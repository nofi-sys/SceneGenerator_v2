The scene opens with Rosie Brine approaching a trio of children who are sitting on the lawn of the Lathrop residence. Rosie begins to swing in a hammock, asking the children if they know when Maida, a mutual friend, is coming back. When nobody answers, Rosie declares that she doesn't believe Maida is ever coming back. Arthur Duncan, one of the children, tells Rosie that Maida is coming back and that she always keeps her promises. Laura Lathrop, another child, says that it was easier to deal with Maida being gone when they were all in school because they didn't have time to miss her. Harold Lathrop, the third child, asks what they are going to do today, since it is the first day of vacation. Arthur says that he can't think of anything to do and just wants to lie in the grass. The scene ends with the children sitting in the hot sun, listless and tired.
