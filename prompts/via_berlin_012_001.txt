The literary style of this scene is characterized by its suspenseful, mysterious tone. The point of view is third person limited, and the reader is only privy to the thoughts and feelings of the character Rutile. This creates a sense of unease and tension, as we are left wondering what is going on outside of Rutile's apartment. The dialogue is also sharp and full of tension, as the characters argue with each other.
