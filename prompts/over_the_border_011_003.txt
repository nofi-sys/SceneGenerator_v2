The scene opens with the captain of a ship, Mr. Rogers, questioning one of his crew members, Bill, about what happened the previous night. Bill tells the captain that he saw the other accused prisoner, Tom, leave the wheel and go to the mate's window where he stabbed him. The captain then questions Tom who tells a different story. Tom says that he saw Bill leave the ship and go to the window where he stabbed the mate. The captain is angry with the two men for not speaking up sooner and for accusing each other. Rogers then speculates that neither man could have committed the murder, but Tom proves that he could have by reenacting the events of that night. The scene ends with the captain feeling sympathy for the two brothers.

-Captain Merwin: the captain of the ship, he is indignant at the two accused prisoners
-Mabel: the only witness, she can only say she saw one of the men draw his head and shoulders out of the mate's window
-Bill: one of the accused prisoners, he is direct and short in his testimony
-Tom: the other accused prisoner, he has more to say than Bill and gives a detailed account of what he saw

The purpose of this scene is to establish the innocence of one of the accused prisoners, and to condemn the other. The author achieves this by having the two prisoners give testimony against each other, and by having the only witness to the crime be unable to identify which of the two men is guilty.
