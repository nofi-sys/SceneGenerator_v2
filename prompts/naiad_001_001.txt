The literary style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The tone is polite but cool, and the point of view is third person limited.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Madame d'Ionis and Zphyrine, and to set up the conflict between them.
Madame d'Ionis is shown to be a kind and considerate woman, who is trying to make her mother-in-law's life more pleasant. She is also shown to be a bit manipulative, as she encourages the dowager's belief in the green ladies in order to keep her from worrying about the law suit.
Zphyrine, on the other hand, is shown to be a skeptical and practical woman. She is not fooled by Madame d'Ionis's ploy, and she is more interested in the reality of the law suit than in the dowager's fantasy.
