The purpose of this scene is to establish the author's credentials as a trustworthy narrator. The author also establishes the close relationship between the narrator and the Grand Duchess, which will be important later on.

Aurora, the Grand Duchess, has fallen ill with brain fever and is being cared for by her maid, Melusine. I, the narrator, have just revealed to them both that the Duke of Sangha is planning to overthrow Aurora. Aurora is shocked, but quickly recovers and decides to take action. She orders her car to be ready at four o'clock instead of five, telling us that she will come to fetch me at midnight so that we can investigate the Duke's plot. Melusine is worried, but Aurora is resolute.
