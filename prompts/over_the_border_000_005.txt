The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. The captain is explaining to Felton how he destroyed the _Argyll_, and Felton is trying to understand what happened. There is no hint of emotion or drama in the way the scene is written.

-Captain: Stepping down and laying a hand on Felton's shoulder. "You're not drugged. You're a little off your balance, and the drink was too heavy. Every drunken man sees double. Isn't that so?" This seemed logical, and Felton stammered assent.
-Felton: Climbing to the small platform on which the captain stood. Just before him was the eyepiece of the periscope, and, at a sign from the captain, he peeped into it.
-The crew of the airship: Displayed mortal fear of the captain, and jumped overboard at sight of him.
-The captain of the airship: Reversed his polarity, that's all. See that? Look, and listen." The captain turned a lever, and a dynamo nearby began to revolve, while an arc lamp suspended from above glowed, glistened, and sparkled, as the current passed through the carbons. Soon it began a curious, musical buzzing, and the captain shut it off.

The captain of a submarine explains to Felton how he destroyed the battleship _Argyll_ by reversing its polarity. He tells Felton that he is on the side of the Lord, and that Felton is a fool for believing in the invulnerability of the battleship.
