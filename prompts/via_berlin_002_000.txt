The scene opens with Topham waking up with a headache and nausea, the after-effects of the night before. He recalls being seasick and being helped by a Senorita Ferreira, but does not remember much else. He goes on deck and begins to feel better, but does not see the Senorita anywhere. He begins to think that maybe he was deliberately drugged in order to be robbed of a packet he was carrying, but is not sure. He decides to speak to the Spaniard who offered him a cigarette the night before, in hopes of getting some answers. The Senorita finally appears on deck later in the afternoon, and Topham goes to speak to her. They chat for a while, and the Senorita tells him that she must go to dinner. Topham asks her for another opportunity to talk, and she agrees.

-Topham: the protagonist, a man who was drugged the night before and is trying to figure out who did it
-Senorita Ferreira: the Spanish girl who Topham spoke to the day before and who he suspects may have drugged him
-The Spaniard: a man who Topham thinks may have drugged him

The style of this scene is formal and polite. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is somewhat mysterious.
