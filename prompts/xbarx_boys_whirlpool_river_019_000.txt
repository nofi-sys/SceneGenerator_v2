The purpose of this scene is to reveal that the cattle have been stolen by a gang of outlaws, not by Jake Trummer as Bardwell Manley had assumed. The author achieves this goal by having Teddy and Roy tell their story of what they overheard to Jake and Bardwell.

Two men from different ranches have a fight and then make up. The fight was over some cattle that were stolen. The men find out that it was a man named Denver Smith who stole the cattle and not Jake Trummer.

The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is told from Teddy's point of view, and the tone is mostly conversational. There is some tension between Mr. Manley and Jake Trummer, but it is resolved by the end of the scene.
