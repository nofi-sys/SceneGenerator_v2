- Wayne wants to be anesthetized with Dr. Felder's new anesthetic, novether, in order to see if it will work on him
- Dr. Felder is a doctor who specializes in sleep and has written a book on the subject
- Wayne has been living under an assumed name for years because he doesn't want to be known as the 'man who doesn't sleep'
- Dr. Felder's daughter, Marcia, is also interested in Wayne as a medical specimen
- Dr. Felder agrees to anesthetize Wayne and he is successfully put to sleep

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Wayne Randall and to establish his motivation for wanting to be anesthetized. The author achieves this by having Dr. Felder explain to Wayne the consensus of the doctors who studied him - that he is a mutant with a gland that allows him to stay awake and active without sleep. Wayne then explains that he wants to be anesthetized in order to find out if the new anesthetic, novether, will work on him.
