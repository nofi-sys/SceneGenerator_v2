The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator. However, the author does use some literary devices to create a more vivid picture. For instance, they use personification when they write that "the weather was cold and wet; the grain took long to ripen." This gives the reader a sense of the weather almost having a will of its own, which can be frustrating for farmers. They also use sensory language to describe the thunderstorm, which allows readers to almost feel the hail hitting them.
