The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Manton as someone who is prideful and suspicious. The author achieves this goal by having the Sleep-Walker tell Manton that he must be more humble and that he has hard lessons yet to learn.

The scene opens with Manton sitting at his writing desk, when suddenly the door bursts open and Madame enters, dressed in white. She appears to be in a trance-like state, and slowly approaches Manton, her hands outstretched. Manton recognizes that she is imitating the Sleep-Walker from the book he had just read, and decides to play along.
Madame begins to speak, but has difficulty forming words. She tells Manton that he must be more humble and that his pride and suspicion will never let him be saved. She says he must have some hard lessons yet to bring him down to humility and purify him.
Manton grows impatient and finally asks if that is all she has to say to him. Madame pauses for a moment, then tells him that there is more she must show him. She takes his hand and leads him out of the room.
The next scene shows Madame leading Manton down a dark hallway. She stops at a door and opens it, revealing a small, dark room. She leads Manton inside and tells him to sit down.
Manton asks what she is going to do, and Madame tells him that he must trust her. She begins to chant and wave her hands in the air, and Manton feels himself becoming drowsy. He soon falls asleep.
When he wakes up, he finds himself in a strange place. He is sitting in a large chair, and Madame is standing in front of him, holding a book. She tells him that he is in the future, and that he must listen to what she has to say.
Madame proceeds to tell Manton about the events that will take place in his life, and how he must act in order to avoid disaster. She tells him that he will be tempted to pride and arrogance, but he must resist. She also tells him that he will be tempted by women, but he must remain faithful to his wife.
When Madame is finished, she tells Manton to wake up. He does so, and finds himself back in the small, dark room. Madame tells him that he must remember what she has told him, and then she leaves.
