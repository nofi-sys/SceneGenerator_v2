The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Margot and Jean, and to set up the conflict between them. Margot is presented as a well-meaning but somewhat ditzy young woman, while Jean is shown to be a talented but temperamental musician. The scene also establishes the setting and establishes the tone of the story, which appears to be a light-hearted comedy.

The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is somewhat critical.
