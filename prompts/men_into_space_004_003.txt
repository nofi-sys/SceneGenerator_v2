McCauley is in his office at the space station, talking to two young officers who are on a mission to the moon. He is stern with them, and orders them to come back to the station immediately. The officers are reluctant, as they know they will not have enough air to make the journey back. However, McCauley tells them to head for Repeater One, which is closer to the station than their current location.
The officers begin their journey, and McCauley listens in on their conversation. They are resentful of each other, but cooperate in order to get back to the station. After a while, they lose radio contact with McCauley.
McCauley waits, and eventually picks up their radio transmissions again. They are close to Repeater One, but are having trouble finding it. McCauley gives them directions, and they finally find the relay station. However, they discover that the station is in disrepair, and will not be able to relay their signal back to the space station.
The officers are now in a desperate situation, as they do not have enough air to make it back to the station. They discuss their options, and eventually decide to try to repair the relay station. McCauley listens in as they work, and eventually they are able to get the station up and running. They radio McCauley to let him know they are safe, and he tells them to stay put until he can come and get them.
