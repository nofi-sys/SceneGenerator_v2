A man and his horse, Red Lightning, are traveling through a canyon in search of food. They come across a spring of water and decide to rest. The man removes his saddle and bridle from Red Lightning and lets him graze on the grass while he bathes in the spring. The man is hoping to find some human habitation where he can get food. 
The man comes across a small camp of three tents. He is discovered by a group of dogs who start barking. A man's head appears in the opening of one of the tents, but quickly withdraws. The man calls out that he wants to speak with their chief. The man waits for a minute, but when he doesn't receive a reply, calls out again. This time, the man receives a reply. The man in the tent tells him to go away or they will kill him. The man explains that he is not a Kalkar and has just escaped from them. He is in search of his own people who are fighting the Kalkars at the edge of their great camp to the east. 
The man in the tent comes out to investigate the man's claims. He is a small man, only three feet tall. He is followed by two other men of the same height. They form a semicircle around the man. The man in the middle tells the man that they have never been beyond their own hills. The man explains that he is from the desert beyond their farthest mountains. 
It is difficult to understand each other, but they manage to make themselves understood. The man in the middle tells the man that he can stay the night and in the morning, he will give him something to eat and send him on his way.
