The style of this scene is rough and crude, with a hint of violence. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of desperation.

The scene opens with Dodson robbing the till at the Back Home, a store owned by Mollie. He boasts of his exploits to his cronies, and Scot, who has been keeping an eye on him, hears about it. Scot decides to confront Dodson, and two days later, Dodson comes to the store. Mollie tries to stop him from taking the rent money, and Dodson begins to beat her. Scot intervenes and throws Dodson against the wall, knocking him unconscious. Mollie falls into Scot's arms, and he kisses her. She pushes him away, but he declares his love for her and promises to take care of her. In the days that follow, Scot struggles with his feelings for Mollie, pacing the floor and fighting against his desire for her.
