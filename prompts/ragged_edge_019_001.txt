The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is fairly neutral. There is some dialogue, but it is not particularly poetic or flowery.

- Goose McGonagle and second-hand dealer OHara are discussing the latter's outstanding debt
- Annie Clancy interrupts to tell Goose that her father, the store owner, has been in a bad mood since his half-sister's death
- Goose goes to talk to the store owner, who refuses to listen and orders Annie to return to work
- OHara threatens to send the constable after the store owner if he does not pay his debt by the next day

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Goose McGonagle and Annie Clancy's father. The author achieves this by having the two men argue over money owed to OHara, the second-hand dealer. This sets up the tension between the two characters and sets up the conflict for the rest of the story.
