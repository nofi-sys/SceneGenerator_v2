The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of emotion or feeling, and the point of view is that of an objective narrator.

-Orthis: A Va-gas man who is treated with distinction by Ga-va-go.
-Ga-va-go: The savage chieftain of the Va-gas tribe.
-Nah-ee-lah: A woman of the U-ga race who is being held captive by the Va-gas.
-Jemadar: Nah-ee-lah's father, a ruler of a great city.
-Laythe: The city of Laythe, ruled by Jemadar.

- Orthis and the narrator are separated after the Va-gas occupy the new village. Orthis is given a hut close to Ga-va-go, while the narrator is placed in another section.
- The narrator learns from the woman who taught her the Va-gas language that Orthis has promised to lead Ga-va-go to the land of the Va-gas' origin, where there is supposedly an abundance of flesh.
- Nah-ee-lah is confined in another part of the village, and the narrator only sees her occasionally. The narrator asks Nah-ee-lah why the Va-gas have not slain and eaten her, and Nah-ee-lah tells her that Ga-va-go has offered to return her to her father, the Jemadar, in exchange for 100 young women from the city of Laythe.
- The narrator and Nah-ee-lah walk into the woods and gather fruit. Nah-ee-lah tells the narrator that she only eats the flesh of the Va-gas, and the narrator is disgusted.
- The narrator thinks about it and realizes that Nah-ee-lah is not transgressing any natural law by eating the flesh of the Va-gas. The narrator decides that humans are more likely to be transgressing a natural law by eating the flesh of domestic animals.
