The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing objective description of the events. There is a bit of dialogue between the characters, but mostly the narrator is simply describing what is happening. There is a bit of foreshadowing with the mention of sharks, but otherwise the tone is fairly light and cheerful.
