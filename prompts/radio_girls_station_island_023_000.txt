The scene opens with Henrietta Haney, a young girl, talking to a wireless operator at a lighthouse station. She tells him that her friends, Jessie and Amy, are on a yacht (the Marigold) that sailed from Station Island the day before. The operator tells her that if they have a wireless on board the yacht, they may be able to catch a signal from the lighthouse.
 Henrietta then asks the operator to send a message to Jessie and Amy on the yacht. She dictates a message for them, which the operator sends out over the wireless. The message says "Miss Jessie, come home. The yacht is going to Boston without you."
The operator is surprised that Henrietta knows so much about radio and wireless technology. She tells him that Jessie is the one who invented it and built the first radio at Roselawn.
The scene ends with the operator sending out the message and Henrietta waiting to see if Jessie and Amy will receive it.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Henrietta Haney and to provide some background information about her. The author achieves this by having Henrietta interact with the wireless operator and revealing her loneliness and her love for Jessie.
