The purpose of this scene is to establish the backstory of the characters and to set up the conflict for the rest of the story. The author achieves this by revealing that Fay and Saidee have a history together and that Dutch Gus is a threat to both of them.

Saidee Isaacs tells Fay that Dutch Gus is in London, working with a group of Germans and Austrians who are trying to steal a cipher from the embassy. She gives Fay a revolver and tells him to be careful.

The literary style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of mystery and danger. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is tense and foreboding.
