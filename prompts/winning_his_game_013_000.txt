The literary style of this scene is light-hearted and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person limited.

The scene opens with Hugh, Jimmy, and Nick discussing the disappearance of their canoes. They speculate that the canoes may have run aground somewhere, and decide to walk home. The journey is difficult, as they have to navigate a marsh in the dark. They eventually make it back to campus, wet and muddy. Nick philosophically notes that at least their story about losing the canoes will be believable.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict and goal for the story. The conflict is that the boys are lost in the marsh and their goal is to find their way home.
