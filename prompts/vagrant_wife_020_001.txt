-Annie: the wife, "rather reluctantly" submitted to interrogation by her husband. She is described as having "dark eyes" and being "restless."
-Harry: the husband, who is "not in a mood to be argued with." He is described as having "lost his bright color" and looking "much older than when she had left the Grange."
-Mr. Aubrey Cooke: a friend of Annie's from her days as an actress, described as a "relative of [hers]" by the servant.

The purpose of this scene is to establish conflict between the husband and wife. The husband is accusing the wife of lying and being unfaithful, while the wife is trying to defend herself. This conflict will likely continue throughout the story.
