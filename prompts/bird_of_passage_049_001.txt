The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Barry and to set up the conflict between him and Helen. Barry is shown to be a crude, insensitive man who is more interested in himself than in others. He is also shown to be attracted to Helen, which sets up the conflict that will drive the story.

- Barry arrives at Dido and Katie's house and is introduced to Helen
- Barry and Helen begin talking and he is immediately impressed by her
- The group moves to the dining room for lunch where Barry proceeds to stuff himself
- Barry asks Helen about her time in the East and she tells him about her work as a governess
- Barry declares that he will take her to the band at Terryscreen next week

The style of this scene is light and conversational, with a bit of banter between the characters. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Helen's perspective.
