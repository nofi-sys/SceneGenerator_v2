-The scene is set in a forest, with a car full of children travelling down a long, winding road.
-The car turns into a clearing and the children see a group of deer.
-The deer run away and the car continues on, until they come to a huge house with a lawn full of peacocks.

The style of this scene is very descriptive, with a focus on the natural setting. The tone is peaceful and calming, and the point of view is third person omniscient.
