The literary style of this scene is characterized by its use of dialogue to further the plot. The tone is one of suspense and mystery, as the reader is left wondering what the woman has done to "catch her man." The point of view is third person limited, as the reader is only privy to the thoughts and feelings of the woman.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of the woman and to hint at her past. The author achieves this by having the woman act in a strange and mysterious way, which intrigues the other character and the reader.

The scene opens with the heroine, who has just been through a tough morning, walking with a spring in her step and a gleam in her eye. She is headed to a large, fashionable boarding house and, upon entering, is immediately accosted by another woman. This woman, after taking in the state of the heroine's clothing, starts to interrogate her about how she managed to "catch" her man. The heroine is nonplussed by the woman's questions and seems lost in her own thoughts. The other woman, growing impatient, demands to know what is going on. The heroine then comes out of her reverie and, with a smile, tells the other woman that she has "caught her man" and that she need not worry about him anymore.
