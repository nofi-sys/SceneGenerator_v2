McCauley orders Sammy Breen to catch his space rope, and then to tie on all of his equipment except for his air tanks. They continue to drift away from the Platform, and McCauley calculates their speed and angular velocity. He then orders Sammy to push the equipment at the end of the rope away from him, in the direction they are spinning.
