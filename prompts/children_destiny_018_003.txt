Skelton and Sylvia are sitting in the drawing room together when Mrs. Shapleigh and old Tom come in. Mrs. Shapleigh is surprised to see them together and old Tom says that they have been "bamboozled." Skelton and Sylvia agree that they are in love and are going to marry. Mrs. Shapleigh is shocked and says that there is the matter of Lewis Pryor. Skelton and Sylvia explain that they have already discussed it and are in agreement. Mr. Shapleigh gives his consent and Skelton leaves.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Skelton and Sylvia, and to show that they are both determined to marry each other despite the objections of her parents.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its tone of irony and sarcasm. The narrator is clearly mocking the characters, particularly Skelton and Mrs. Shapleigh. The point of view is also omniscient, allowing the reader to see into the thoughts of the characters.
