- Nathan and Lissa are on their way to the trading post and Indian village. 
- They are greeted by a number of Indians, each one asking about the _chuppet_ who accompanied him. 
- Soon they are at the village, a collection of Indian huts covering quite an area of ground. 
- The Indian industries seemed to be confined to the women, who were laboriously employed roasting corn in holes in the ground or scraping and rubbing the bison skins which had been recently brought in from the plains. 
- In vain our Eastern woman looked for the beautiful Indian maiden of poesy and song.
