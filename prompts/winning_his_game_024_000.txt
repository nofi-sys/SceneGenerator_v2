The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing objective description of the events. However, there is a bit of humor in the way the events are described, particularly in the dialogue between Jimmy and Dud.

- The team, 15 strong, leaves on the later train for Greenbank.
- Most of the team hopes for a second victory so they can go home for the summer, but a few want the series to go to three games so they can play.
- Dud and Jimmy sit together and Jimmy tries to make Star Meyer uncomfortable by staring at the back of his head.
- There is a delay at Webster and most of the team disembarks to stretch their legs.
- Jimmy and Dud wander back from the rear car and when the train starts to leave, they run after it.
- Jimmy grabs the railing and is pulled up by someone on the platform.
- Jimmy and Dud are rolled onto the platform and the train takes off.
- Jimmy gives chase, but the figure in the doorway of the last car waves goodbye.
