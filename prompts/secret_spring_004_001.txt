M. Thierry is discussing the recent death of the Grand Duke Rudolph of Lautenburg-Detmold with a young man who is considering taking a teaching position in the duchy. He tells the young man that the duchy is ruled by a peculiar set of laws, and that on the death of the Grand Duke, the crown passed to his wife, the Grand Duchess Aurora Anna Eleanor. This means that she is now married to her brother-in-law, the new Grand Duke Frederick Augustus.
M. Thierry goes on to say that there have been rumours of violent deaths at the Court of Lautenburg-Detmold, and that he has been told that the Grand Duke Frederick Augustus is a very extraordinary man who is capable of dissembling. He suggests that the Grand Duke may have been responsible for the death of his first wife, Countess von Tepwitz, and that he is a man of ambition who would not stop at anything.
The young man is intrigued by this information and asks M. Thierry to tell him more. M. Thierry says that he does not know much about the Grand Duchess, except for her age, Christian names, Russian origin, and that she was a Tumene princess. He says that it is possible that she is in collusion with the Grand Duke, but he does not know for sure.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the political situation in the fictional country of Lautenburg-Detmold. The author achieves this goal by having the character of M. Thierry explain the recent history of the country and the current situation of the royal family.
