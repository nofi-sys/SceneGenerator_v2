The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the landscape and the train station, and by introducing Fay and Saidee Isaacs.

Chester and Saidee are in Holland, trying to figure out how Harry Raymond is able to win so consistently at cards. They believe that there is some sort of connection between the smoked glasses he wears and his success.
They decide to go to Stavanger in order to get in a game with him and try to figure out his secret. They take a train which is headed for Delfzijl.
On the train, Fay purchases a first-class compartment for them. They arrive in Delfzijl just before dawn and have time to connect with the boat. They purchase clean linen and gloves for the trip.
The boat ride takes all day and part of the night. They arrive in Stavanger and go to the card game. They lose, but Fay is able to talk to Harry Raymond and learn that the glasses he wears are double-sided and have a hidden compartment in them. This compartment contains a cipher which allows him to know what cards are being played.
