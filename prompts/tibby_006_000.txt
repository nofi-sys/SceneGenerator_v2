Lissa wakes up in her new home, an adobe house on the prairie. She looks around and takes in the details of the house and the surrounding landscape. She wonders where her husband, Nathan, has gone.
She is interrupted by the arrival of Alice, who has come to take her to breakfast. Alice is carrying a large basket, which she sets down on the table. She explains that Nathan sent her to the post office to get some things.
Lissa and Alice walk to Alice's house, where they have breakfast. After breakfast, they walk back to Lissa's house. Lissa unpacks and arranges her belongings while Nathan is gone.
When Nathan returns, they sit down to tea. Lissa screams and spills tea when she sees an Indian's face pressed against the window. The Indian comes to the door and asks for food. Nathan gives him some biscuits and a watermelon. The Indian leaves.
