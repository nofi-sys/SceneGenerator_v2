The scene opens with Maida being greeted by her old friends in the Primrose Court. They all ask her questions about her life and she answers them politely. The children in the group are excited to see her and they all start talking at once. They tell her about their lives and what they have been up to. Tony the parrot interrupts them periodically with his own questions.
After a while, the group settles down on the Lathrop lawn and they continue to talk. They catch up on each other's lives and gossip about the people in the Court. They talk about how much everyone has grown and how different they all look. They are interrupted by Mrs. Lathrop and the Misses Allison, who start asking Maida more questions. Tony the parrot also starts up again with his questions.
 eventually the group says goodbye to Maida and she goes back to her own rooms in the Court.
