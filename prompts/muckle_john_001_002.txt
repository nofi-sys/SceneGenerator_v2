The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of the stranger, who is later revealed to be Muckle John. The author also establishes the relationship between the schoolmaster and Miss Macpherson, and reveals that they are conspiring against Rob.

It is pitch dark when the scene opens, and the protagonist wakes up suddenly, listening intently. He thinks he hears somebody speaking in the room, but there is only the sound of the wind outside. Then he hears a muffled conversation between Mr. Macaulay, the schoolmaster, and his aunt. They are discussing somebody they saw, and the schoolmaster says he wants to catch this person.
Rob, the protagonist, realizes they are talking about the big man from Fraser's tavern, and he knows in a trice who the great man in Fraser's tavern had been, who but the stranger on the moor who had lured the weasel from his lair. He is overjoyed, but the schoolmaster and his aunt are still discussing how to capture this person.
Suddenly, they hear the sound of music, and the schoolmaster recognizes it as the pipe of Muckle John. The music is getting closer, and then there is a banging at the door. The schoolmaster is afraid, but the aunt tells him to open the door.
A cold blast of air comes into the room, along with a tall, formidable man dressed in riding clothes. He has to bend nearly double to enter. The aunt holds a candle up to his face. The stranger closes the door behind him, takes off his hat, and bows.

The style of this scene is suspenseful and mysterious. The point of view is from Rob's perspective, and the tone is one of fear and danger.
