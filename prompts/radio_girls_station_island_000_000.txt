The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Jessie, Amy, and Nell, and to set up the conflict between Amy and Jessie. Amy is presented as a fun-loving, impulsive girl, while Jessie is more serious and level-headed. Nell is the voice of reason between them.

-Jessie Norwood: gaily excited, bounding into her sitting room waving a slit envelope over her sunny head, her face alight. Wore a pretty silk slip-on, a sports skirt, and silk hose and oxfords.
-Amy Drew: Jessie's chum, sitting in the sitting room with Nell Stanley. Tossed back her hair and grinned elfishly.
-Nell Stanley: Busy with sewing in her lap. The two visitors looked up in some surprise at Jessie's boisterous entrance, for usually she was the demurest of creatures.
-Mrs. Norwood: Jessie's mother, at the head of the committee that had in charge the raising of the foundation fund for the New Melford Women's and Children's Hospital.
-The Reverend: Nell Stanley's father, the minister.
-Fred: one of the Reverend's children.
-Bob: one of the Reverend's children.
-Sally: one of the Reverend's children.

Jessie Norwood is excited because she has received a five dollar donation for the hospital fund she is helping to raise money for. Her friends Amy Drew and Nell Stanley are with her in her sitting room and they are all discussing the recent success of the radio concert they put on to raise money. Amy is proud of the success and takes credit for suggesting the concert, while Nell is more humble, saying that they all contributed and it was a joint effort. Jessie agrees that it was a successful event, but points out that the excitement is over and they need to find something else to do to keep from getting bored.
Amy immediately suggests that they find something else exciting to do for the rest of the summer. Nell suggests that they go up to the farm where they went last year, but Amy is not enthusiastic about the idea, calling it boring. Jessie suggests that maybe Nell should have a break from her family and take a vacation without them, but Nell is not sure that is the right thing to do. They continue to discuss their options for the summer when Jessie's mother comes in and asks what they are talking about.
