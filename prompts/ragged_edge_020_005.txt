The scene opens with Larry nominating John Kerrigan for office. This causes an uproar among the anti-Kelly faction, who were expecting James Kelly to win. James Kelly is angry and surprised at the turn of events.
The vote is taken, and Larry and his friends move to coerce Daily and Levitsky into voting for Kerrigan. James Kelly and McQuirk hurry over to prevent this from happening. There is a brief scuffle, during which Larry threatens Daily and Levitsky with violence if they don't vote for Kerrigan.
In the end, James Kelly and McQuirk manage to calm the situation and the vote is taken without further incident.
