-Ruth: the girl; free and light-footed as a fawn; vivid and enthusiastic; attractive; a little wilful
-McCoy: the cattleman; loves all young, clean life; had been thinking of her since he left her at the gate of the Lodge
-Miss Morgan: Ruth's aunt; a thin, flat-bosomed spinster with the marks of ill health on her face; views life from a narrow, Puritanic standpoint
-Ruth (as a child): an orphan; brought up by Miss Morgan; a lawless, wilful little thing; naughty and painfully plain; difficult to train
-Flanders: a friend of McCoy's; says he's a famous bronco buster

-Ruth and McCoy are at Elkhorn Lodge and Ruth has just introduced him to her aunt, a thin, flat-bosomed spinster with the marks of ill health on her face. 
-Miss Morgan and her niece had come to the Rockies for the health of the older woman, and were scheduled to make an indefinite stay. 
-Ruth had been a lawless, wilful little thing, naughty and painfully plain by the standard of her aunt; a difficult little girl to train in the way she should go. 
-Surprisingly she had blossomed from the ugly-duckling stage into a most attractive girl. 
-The riders pass a poster for the annual round-up at Bad Ax and Ruth is determined that McCoy will ride. 
-From Flat Top they watched the sun go down behind a sea of rounded hills.

The style of this scene is lyrical and romantic. The point of view is from McCoy's perspective, and the tone is one of admiration and longing.
