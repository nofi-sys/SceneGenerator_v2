The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Mrs. Trimwell and to provide some comic relief. Mrs. Trimwell is presented as a down-to-earth woman with no time for church-going or sermons. Her frankness catches Corin off guard and he is unable to respond in kind. John is amused by the whole exchange.

-Mrs. Trimwell: an older woman, likely in her 60s or 70s. She is a widow and has a daughter, Tilda, who is mentioned later in the scene. She is a working class woman who is not religious.
-John: a young man, likely in his 20s. He is an artist who is working on restoring a church. He is from a wealthy family.
-Corin: a young man, likely in his 20s. He is John's friend and is helping him with the church restoration. He is also from a wealthy family.

- Mrs. Trimwell tells John and Corin about the day her uncle died, and how she fought for her daughter's life. 
- She talks about how she doesn't go to church, and how she thinks people should pray at home. 
- Corin and John agree with her, and John is amused by Corin's reaction to Mrs. Trimwell's dogmatic views.
