Archie and Bob are on their way to see Mr. Winslow and his daughter, Etheldene. Archie warns Bob that Mr. Winslow is a "rough stick" and not to be taken lightly. They arrive and are greeted by Etheldene, who leads them around to show off her pets and various other things. Mr. Winslow soon appears and they all have tea together. Afterwards, they all go their separate ways.
