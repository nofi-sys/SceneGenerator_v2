The purpose of this scene is to provide comic relief and to show
Archie's mischievous nature. The author achieves this by having Archie
dress up in his father's hunting gear, which is much too big for him.
This causes everyone to laugh, including Archie's brother Rupert who
is still recovering from his illness.

The style of this scene is light-hearted and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person omniscient.
