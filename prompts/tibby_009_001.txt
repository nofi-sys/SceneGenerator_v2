- Mrs. Wylie and Mrs. Lucien discuss conservatism and its crimes.
- They are joined by others as they sit near the door in a dimly lit room, waiting for the medium to arrive.
- The medium arrives, sits down, and asks for someone to sing.
- The spectators begin to sing religious hymns and almost immediately, a figure of light appears.
- The figure is called Starlight and vanishes.
- The medium then enters the cabinet and voices of different men are heard.
- Some in the audience recognize the voices.
- After a period of quiet, the curtains part again and a slender woman appears.
- The woman delivers a short oration on Universal Progress.
- She withdraws to give place to another figure, which calls a name in a soft, plaintive voice.
- The figure is recognized by a man in the audience and he goes forward, leading her around the room.
- Mrs. Wylie becomes agitated, fearing the next figure will be for her.
- As if to confirm her words, a figure of light advances and hovers before the cabinet.
- The figure is for Mrs. Lucien and she goes forward, embracing it.
- The figure calls her "mamma" and then a second, larger figure appears.
- For a moment, they hover flutteringly before her, then disappear and Mrs. Lucien is led back to her seat.
- Another figure appears, a man. A woman behind Mrs. Wylie arises and goes forward.
- The figure is for her and she cries out "O Jim!"
- The figure replies that he is sorry he did not do more for her when he was alive.
- With a groan, he disappears.
