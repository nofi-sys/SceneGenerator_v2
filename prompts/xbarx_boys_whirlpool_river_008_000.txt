The scene opens with Teddy and Roy questioning Nick about a letter they received from their father. Nick is initially tight-lipped about the contents of the letter, but after some prodding from the boys, he eventually opens up. He tells them that their father is worried about a slide near Whirlpool River that could force the cattle into the water.
Nick then goes on to tell the boys about a stranger who came to their camp last night and warned them about the slide. He says that the man told them that the whole top of Friendly Mountain has shifted and part of it has already slid into the valley. He says that if the rest of the mountain slides, it will block up the river and the cattle will be in danger.
Teddy and Roy are worried about their mother being alone with Marino, but Nick assures them that he will stay with her and she will be fine. The boys then set off to find Bug Eye and Pop to tell them about the situation.
Mrs. Manley takes the news of the situation calmly. Teddy and Roy promise to bring back some fish for Belle when they return. As they are leaving, Roy jokes that the only fish they are likely to catch are the kind that walk on land.

-Teddy: excited, curious
-Nick: mumbles, then becomes chatty after eating
-Roy: concerned, excited
-Slim Holiday: singing
-Hombre on Pony: brings news of slide
-Mrs. Manley: calm
-Nell and Ethel: disappointed
-Belle: excited about the possibility of fish

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the conflict that the boys will face in the story. Nick has just arrived with news that a slide has occurred near where their cattle are grazing, and that the whole mountain is in danger of collapsing. This puts the boys in a difficult position, as they must decide whether to stay and protect their home, or go and try to save the cattle.
