In the scene, McCoy is discussing with Silcott the issue of Joe Tait, a sheepman, crossing the "dead line" into cattle territory. They are joined by Rowan and Rogers, and they discuss what to do about the situation. They decide that Tait needs to be taught a lesson, and they plan to do so by meeting him halfway and showing him that he cannot just cross the line whenever he wants.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the cattlemen and the sheepmen. The author achieves this by showing the cattlemen's reaction to the news that the sheepmen are encroaching on their territory.
