The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Hi and the people in the camp. Hi is trying to reach Anselmo to warn Don Manuel of the Reds, but the people in the camp are suspicious of him and don't want to let him go. This conflict will drive the rest of the story.

- Hi: English, new to the land, does not speak Spanish
- Anton: Hi's friend, translating for him
- Don Pablo: leader of the group, suspicious of Hi
- the assembly: a group of talkers, mostly White and anti-clerical

Hi is woken up by the sound of his bombilla falling on the floor. He sees a big, elderly man with bloodshot eyes and a heavy mouth come into the room and realizes that this man is the leader of the group. Hi is then introduced to Don Pablo and he explains that he is on urgent business to see Don Manuel at Encinitas. However, he soon realizes that he has said something wrong as the group is anti-clerical and they hate Don Manuel. Anton then explains that Hi cannot reach Don Manuel from there and Hi says that he wants to reach Anselmo from there and from there go on to Don Manuel. However, the group is suspicious of Hi and they agree that he may justly be suspected. Don Pablo then says that Hi cannot go to Anselmo and Hi says that he must go. However, the group is still suspicious of Hi and they agree that he cannot go.
