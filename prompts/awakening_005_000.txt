1. The protagonist is a woman who wants to be made more beautiful.
2. The man is Julian, an eccentric beautician who specializes in making robots look more beautiful than humans.
3. The receptionist is Della, a beautiful but ambitious woman.
4. Kelsey is the protagonist's friend.

In the "room of hope", a square white box filled with shiny chrome cabinets, a willowy man greets the scene's protagonist with enthusiasm. He tells her that she wants to be beautiful, and she confirms that this is true. The man, Julian, promises to make her "radiantly beautiful", and begins to explain how he can make robots more beautiful than humans. He says that it is because they have souls and hearts, and can find pleasure in themselves and in being alone. 
The protagonist asks if she will feel real, the way a human feels, and Julian becomes thoughtful. He touches his forehead and slowly licks his thin red lips, before saying that he doesn't know.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Julian, the robot beautician, and to establish the conflict between him and the protagonist, who is a robot herself. Julian is shown to be a very eccentric character who is obsessed with beauty and with making robots more beautiful than humans. He is also shown to be a very lonely character who seems to find more fulfillment in beautifying robots than in dealing with humans. This sets up a conflict between him and the protagonist, who is a robot herself and who wants to be made more beautiful than any human.
