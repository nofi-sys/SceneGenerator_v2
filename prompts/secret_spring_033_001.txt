The purpose of this scene is to establish the Grand Duchess's character as a brave and determined woman, and to establish the setting of the story as the German-French border during the early days of World War I.

The Grand Duchess Aurora is on her way to the French border to see the troops at the outbreak of war. She is stopped by a group of German soldiers, who are surprised to see her. The officer in charge is Lieutenant von Hagen, of the 7th Hussars.
The Grand Duchess explains that she wanted to see the troops at the frontier, and the officer offers to take her to their commander, General von Offenburg. The General is surprised to see her, but is pleased to have the opportunity to dance with her again.
The Grand Duchess asks the General for an escort to take her as far as the outposts, and he provides a permit for her to return safely. She sets off with a troop of dragoons, but quickly outdistances them on the road.

The tone of this scene is one of excitement, as the Grand Duchess is eager to see the French frontier. The point of view is third person limited, as the reader only knows what the Grand Duchess and Lieutenant von Hagen are thinking and feeling.
