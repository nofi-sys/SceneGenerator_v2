The scene opens with the characters in a land cruiser, driving across a rough landscape. They come across a small stream and then a cluster of vehicles that are partially buried in clay. Borden realizes that Sattell has been there and has taken another vehicle. They set off in pursuit.
The chase leads them to a highway made of stone that stretches out into the distance. They follow the tracks of Sattell's vehicle and eventually catch up to him. When they do, they find that he has been killed by a bow and arrow.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the protagonists and the antagonist, as well as to establish the setting and the stakes of the story. The author achieves these goals by introducing the characters and their respective goals, as well as by describing the setting in detail.
