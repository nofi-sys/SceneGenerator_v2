Dartmoor, a wealthy medical student, takes possession of a freakish creature born without senses and vows to care for it in hopes of one day giving it consciousness. He enlists the help of his old school friend, who is unenthused about the project.
Dartmoor spends years massaging, exercising, and experimenting on the creature, to no avail. Meanwhile, his old friend falls out of favor with him when he loses interest in a girl Dartmoor is interested in.
The friend eventually makes a fortune in the pearl industry and returns to Dartmoor to find that he has finally succeeded in giving the creature consciousness.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Dartmoor and to establish his relationship with the narrator. The author also establishes Dartmoor's motivation for taking on the care of the freak.
