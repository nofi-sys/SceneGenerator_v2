John: tongue-tied, at a loss for words, embarrassed, infected with Rosamund's shyness
Rosamund: cordial, shy, young, assured, pretty, with burnished copper hair

John and Rosamund meet for the eighth time and find themselves tongue-tied and embarrassed. Rosamund suggests they go outside to the garden and John agrees. They admire the view from the terrace and John comments on how much he will miss the place. Rosamund confides in John that she has a feeling they will not have to leave after all, despite knowing it is an irrational feeling. John listens sympathetically and does not mock her.

The style of this scene is very formal and polite. There is a sense of tension and awkwardness between the two characters, likely due to the fact that they are from different social classes. John is very conscious of his lower class status and is trying very hard to impress Rosamund. The author uses a lot of description, both of the setting and the characters' emotions.
