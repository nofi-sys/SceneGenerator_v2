The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two main characters, Topham and the Countess. The author achieves this by having them stare at each other for a moment, during which they each think about what they know of the other. This is followed by the Countess inviting Topham to sit down, which he does.

-Topham is at the home of the Count and Countess of Ouro Preto, waiting to speak with the Countess
-The Countess comes down and they stare at each other for a moment before she greets him
-The Countess leads him to a seat and they sit down to talk
-The Baroness Ostersacken is also in the room and Topham greets her

The style of this scene is formal and polite, with a hint of tension and attraction between the two main characters. There is also a sense of foreboding, as if something is about to happen.
