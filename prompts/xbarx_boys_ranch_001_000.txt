The scene opens with two brothers, Teddy and Roy, discussing recent events on their ranch. They speak of the 8 X 8, where twenty head of cattle were stolen, and of Pop Burns, the oldest hand on the X Bar X ranch. Teddy and Roy then discuss their father's impending arrival, and their hope that his train will be late.
The brothers saunter out to look over the town, which is described as small and unassuming. They notice a man leaning against the front of Rimors Place, a restaurant known for its hard-stuff rather than its food. The man looks tough and out of sorts.
