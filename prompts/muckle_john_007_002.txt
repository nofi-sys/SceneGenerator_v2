Muckle John and Rob are being pursued by a group of men led by Ephraim Macaulay. Muckle John knows the country well and is able to lose their pursuers by leading them on a wild goose chase. However, the men are getting closer and closer and Muckle John knows they won't be able to outrun them forever. He tells Rob that they're after him, not Muckle John, and asks if there's anything he can do to help. Rob doesn't know what to say, but Muckle John is already thinking ahead. He tells Rob to hand over anything he doesn't want the men to find, in case they catch up to them.
