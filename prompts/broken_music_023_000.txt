Jean is on his way home from Rue Lalo, where he had a wonderful encounter with Gabrielle. He is elated and happy, feeling as though anything is possible. He enters his home to find Margot tidying up. He is immediately put off by her presence and annoyed that she would interrupt his thoughts of Gabrielle. They make small talk about music and eventually Margot brings up the subject of the Toriallis. Jean is visibly uncomfortable and Margot picks up on this. She asks if he is happy working for them and he says that he is, but she doesn't believe him. He is too distracted by his own thoughts to pay her much attention. She eventually leaves and he is left to his own thoughts once again.
