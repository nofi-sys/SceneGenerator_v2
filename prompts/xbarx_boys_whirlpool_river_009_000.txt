The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by having the characters interact with each other.

The scene is of a group of men paddling down a river in a hurry, admiring the scenery as they go. Teddy, one of the men, daydreams about a man named The Pup, and wonders if he will try to get revenge on them for leaving him behind. Roy reassures him that there is no danger.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator describing the scenery and the characters' thoughts and actions. There is a bit of dialogue, but mostly the narrator is describing the scene and the characters' reactions to it. The tone is fairly calm and peaceful, despite the characters' hurry, and there is a sense of wonder and beauty in the descriptions of the natural surroundings.
