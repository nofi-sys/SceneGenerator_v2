Jenny Crampton: the Cramptons' daughter; rose-leaf complexion, light hazel eyes, full lips; saucy and pretty
Mrs. Crampton: Jenny's mother; mild
Miss Bostock: Jenny's aunt
Mr. Crampton: Jenny's father
Aunt Clem: Jenny's other aunt; lugubrious expression
Mr. Wincher: Arab mare seller
Frederick Walcheren: Jenny's Popish admirer
Roman Catholics: the Walcherens

Jenny, her mother, and her aunt are on their way downstairs when Jenny's father calls her into the library. He tells her that he will not allow her to see or speak to Frederick Walcheren anymore because he is a gambler and a loose liver. If she does not comply, he will take her away from Hampstead. Jenny argues that Walcheren has plenty of money, but her father insists that his religion (he is a Roman Catholic) is an insurmountable barrier between them. He tells her that she must not see Walcheren again, either at their house or anywhere else. If she meets him, she is not to talk to him or dance with him. Jenny reluctantly agrees.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Jenny and her father over her relationship with Frederick Walcheren. Jenny's father is prohibiting her from seeing Frederick anymore, and Jenny is resisting.
