McNew, a newspaper proprietor, visits the White House to speak with the President or his secretary. He is met by a group of reporters who question him about his purpose for being there. McNew is evasive, saying only that he has business to attend to and that he is not there to ask for any favors. The reporters let him pass, and he enters the building.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of McNew and to hint at the conflict to come. The author achieves this by having McNew interact with the other newspaper men and by having him reveal his true purpose for coming to the White House.

The style of this scene is rather formal and businesslike. There is a sense of tension and anticipation among the newspapermen, and McNew comes across as a rather stern and serious figure.
