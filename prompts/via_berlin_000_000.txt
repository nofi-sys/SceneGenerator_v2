The tone of this scene is businesslike and matter-of-fact. The point of view is third person limited, focused on the Secretary of State and Mr. Topham. There is a sense of urgency in the Secretary's voice, as he is eager for Mr. Topham to begin his journey to Japan as soon as possible.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Topham and to provide him with instructions for his mission to Japan. The author achieves these goals by having the Secretary of State question Topham and by having Topham provide information about himself.
