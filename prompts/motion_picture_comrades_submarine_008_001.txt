The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the island and the submarine, and by introducing the characters' conversation about the island.

-Submarine is anchored near Coco Key
-Ballyhoo and Oscar are on deck, looking at the island
-Captain Shooks sends out a boat to check if there are any boats anchored on the other side of the island
-The boat comes back and reports that the coast is clear
-Oscar and Ballyhoo go back to their quarters

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing objective description of the events taking place. There is a bit of dialogue between the characters, but mostly the focus is on the physical setting and the actions of the characters. The tone is relatively neutral, though there is a hint of suspense as the boys wonder whether or not there are people on the island.
