The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Hugh and Vicky, and to set up the conflict between the two families.

Hugh McClintock visits the schoolhouse to walk home with Vicky Lowell, the lone girl who is popular. He finds her administering corporal punishment to a red-headed youth who is crying and promising never to do it again. Miss Lowell is embarrassed to be caught in the role of a stormy Amazon, and Hugh knows that she only whipped the boy after forcing herself to do it.
Vicky explains that she has been having trouble with Tommie, the red-headed boy, who has been bullying the other children. Hugh tells her that she has taken the right course with him and that he will be glad he found his "boss."
They discuss the recent strike on the Ground Hog claim and the danger of other miners jumping their claims. Hugh advises Vicky to take out leases on her claim with a few partners, and she agrees to let him help her.
They talk about Scot and his recovery, Mollie's joy in her baby, and young Alexander Hugh. As they are talking, they meet Ralph Dodson, who Hugh despises since the attempt on his brother's life. Vicky tells Hugh that Dodson is more dangerous than his brother.
