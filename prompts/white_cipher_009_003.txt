Chester and Saidee have just arrived at a summer house on a small island in a canal, after a long journey. Chester is worried that they may be followed, but Saidee is more concerned with the weather. They decide to pull up the bridge to the island to make sure they are not followed, and then wait out the misty morning.

The literary style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of mystery. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is anxious and dangerous.
