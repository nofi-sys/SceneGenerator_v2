The purpose of this scene is to reveal the news of Jenny's elopement to her parents, and to show the father's reaction of anger and despair. The author achieves this by having the father break the news to the Hindeses, and then showing the father's reaction through his dialogue.

Mr Crampton is extremely upset and cannot speak properly. His face is purple from agitation. Hannah fears he is going to have a fit and urges her husband to get him to the house.
Once they are in the house, Mr Crampton is placed in a chair in the library. He finally speaks, telling them that Jenny has gone off with Walcheren. He says they must have been communicating with each other since Wednesday and that Jenny lied about going to the dressmaker yesterday.
He shows them a note from Jenny saying she is married to Walcheren and that they should not be angry with her.
Mr Crampton is angry, saying Jenny has ruined her life and will go to hell because Walcheren is a Catholic. Hannah tries to console him, saying things may not look so black eventually and that Walcheren comes from a good family.

The tone of this scene is one of shock and disbelief, mixed with a touch of anger and sarcasm. The point of view is from the perspective of Mr. and Mrs. Hindes, who are hearing about the situation from Mr. Crampton.
