The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and simple. There is no real authorial voice present, and the point of view is third person limited. The tone is fairly neutral, although there is a hint of suspense or worry in the air.

Teddy and Roy are disappointed to stay at home while their father heads out on a long ride, but they understand his reasoning. They spend the day with their friends from the 8 X 8, then return home in the evening. Teddy goes to the bunkhouse to talk to Nat Raymond about the next day's work, and on the way he hears Flash neigh.
