The scene opens with the three girls, Jessie, Amy, and Nell, working on the new radio arrangement. They are laughing and joking as they work. Amy is hammering on a board, and Jessie tells her to stop because it is too loud. Amy confesses that she does not understand the scientific terms and does not know what she is doing. Nell says that she does not understand the tangle of wires either.
 Jessie tells them that she has arranged a surprise with her college friend, Mark Stratford, that is to come over the radio that evening. The little group of children that have gathered to listen to the radio are excited at the prospect of the surprise.
When the time comes, they tune the radio to the Stratfordtown station and wait. There is some static at first, but it clears up and they hear a deep voice coming over the air. The voice belongs to Mark Stratford, and he proceeds to tell a bedtime story about a little boy with rabbit ears. The story is a hit with the children, who are all ears for the rest of it.
