The style of this scene is light and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person omniscient.

The scene is set at a ball on the island of Ross. It is night, and the full moon is shining brightly. Guests are arriving by boat from the mainland, and the ballroom is decorated with festoons of greenery and flowers.
Mrs. Creery is the center of attention, holding court with the General in the middle of the room. Near the door, Miss Caggett is the center of a noisy group of people, laughing and chatting.
Everyone is waiting for Mr. Quentin, who finally arrives with Mr. Lisle. There is a shocked silence when they see that Mr. Lisle is wearing evening dress, as they had not thought he owned such clothes.
Mr. Lisle is nonchalant about the whole thing, and Miss Caggett pertly comments on his unexpected appearance. The scene ends with the beginning of the Lancers.
