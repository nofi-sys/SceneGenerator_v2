The scene opens with two slaves bringing food to the protagonist and his companion in their prison cell. The protagonist, who is unnamed, is a white man from Earth who has been captured by the Kalkars, a race of cruel, barbaric aliens. He and his companion discuss their chances of escape, and the protagonist comes up with a plan to reach the tunnel that leads to the crater where he and his fellow Earthmen are being held captive.
The protagonist falls asleep, and is awakened by his companion, who tells him that they are to be taken before the Kalkar leader, The Twentyfour. The protagonist is uncooperative, but Moh-goh, his companion, manages to get him to go along.
They are led into a large chamber where The Twentyfour and his court are assembled. The protagonist is interrogated about his home world and his purpose in coming to Laythe, the Kalkar planet. He refuses to answer, and is sentenced to death.
The executioner approaches, but before he can carry out the sentence, the Princess, who is revealed to be alive and well, intervenes and begs for the protagonist's life. The Twentyfour agrees to spare him, on the condition that he agrees to be her slave. The protagonist agrees, and is taken to the Princess's chambers.
The Princess tells the protagonist that she needs his help to escape from Laythe, as she is a prisoner herself. The two of them hatch a plan to reach the tunnel and escape.
They are successful in reaching the tunnel, but are pursued by the Kalkars. The Princess is injured, and the protagonist carries her through the tunnel to safety. They are finally free, and the story ends with the two of them planning their next move.

The style of this scene is rather formal and detached. The narrator is third person limited, and the point of view is that of the protagonist. The tone is somewhat matter-of-fact, and there is little emotion expressed.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of the protagonist and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. The protagonist, John Carter, is introduced as a brave and determined man who is not afraid to take risks. He is also shown to be a man with a strong sense of loyalty and justice. The conflict is established when Carter learns that the woman he loves, Nah-ee-lah, has been taken captive by the Kalkars and that he must find a way to rescue her.
