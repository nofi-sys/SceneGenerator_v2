The scene opens with Annie in a difficult position between her brother-in-law, William, and her husband, Harry. William is always wanting her to be out of doors with him, while Harry teases her with sulky reproaches if she is away from him for more than half an hour.
The invalid (Harry) comes down to the drawing-room, leaning on his brother's arm. Annie has managed to maintain the ascendency over him that she gained in the sickroom. William makes himself obnoxious by calling Harry the Ogre, sometimes out of hearing of his elder brother and sometimes within.
When William is dispatched by Annie to Beckham to meet his eldest brother, Harry knocks over a gypsy-table covered with trifles. As Annie is picking them up, Harry testily says, "What are you in such a hurry for? I do hate a woman to be in a hurry." Annie explains that it is getting late and she must dress for dinner now that George is coming back. Harry sulks in his chair and says, "Oh, all this fuss for George! Your appearance didn't matter for me, I suppose? I'm only your husband!"
Annie tries to reason with Harry, explaining that she has not changed her gown to see him eat toast and mutton-broth in his dressing-gown because he has been ill and she has not wanted to hurt his feelings. Harry suddenly becomes conciliatory, telling Annie that he sometimes thinks she looks prettier when she is mischievous and her eyes sparkle. He adds, "You--you look so mischievous, and your eyes sparkle so, you make one want to kiss you--only then--then, somehow, you never seem to want to be kissed--at least not by me!"
Annie bursts out laughing, a little constrainedly perhaps. She says, carelessly, "Why, whom should I want to kiss me except my husband?" Harry, feeling that his conciliatory speech has not met with the response it deserved, walks over to her and puts his arm on her shoulder. He repeats, "It wouldn't make any difference, would it?" Annie looks up rather mischievously and says, "I don't think it would, Harry." This is a disconcerting answer to a husband.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Harry and William, and to foreshadow the arrival of Wilfred and Sir George. The author achieves these goals by having Annie put off questions about her four years away, leading to tension between the brothers, and by having Harry knock over a table when he's fidgeting.
