-Kelsey: a man who is in tune with his crowd and wants to make sure he stays that way
-Alice: a woman who looks all wrong and can never look any different, never look human
-Gloria: a woman who is half sleeping and staring at the Tevee
-Reacto Tester: a mechanical device that records accurate tastes

The purpose of this scene is to show Alice's internal struggle between her love for Kelsey and her own self-loathing. Alice is a robot who is in love with Kelsey, but she knows that she can never be with him because she is not human. This scene shows her conflict between wanting to be with him and wanting to die.

Alice is a servant in Kelsey's house. Kelsey is watching a self-improvement commercial on TV. The commercial is for a device called the Reacto Tester, which is supposed to help people conform to the tastes of their social group. Kelsey and Alice are both watching the commercial, and Kelsey comments that he thinks Alice likes him a little more than she used to.
Alice goes to her closet to rest, and she begins to think about how different her life is now that she is in love with Kelsey. She remembers how lonely she used to be, but now the loneliness is unbearable because she knows what it feels like to be in love. She thinks about how Kelsey's love makes her feel more alive than she ever has before.
Suddenly, Alice has an epiphany: she realizes that she can no longer just dream about being with Kelsey, she has to take action. She runs out into the backyard and looks up at the open sky, feeling alive and free for the first time.
