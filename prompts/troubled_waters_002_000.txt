In the scene, Joe Tait, a sheep rancher, is in the store of Boviers Camp, a trading center in the heart of cattle country. He is angry about a letter he has received warning him not to cross the badlands. Tait is a big, aggressive man, and the other men in the store are intimidated by him. Rowan McCoy, the leader of the cattle interests in the area, is present, and Tait challenges him to a fight. McCoy does not respond, and after a moment, Tait leaves the store.

The literary style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of hostility and danger.
