- Judy the Fancy: a beggar woman who is also the mother of Andy All Right. She is known for her sharp tongue and for being able to extract money from even the stingiest of people.
- Mrs. Megaw: a well-to-do woman who is often the target of Judy's begging.
- Tim Duffy: another man who is often the target of Judy's begging.
- Mr. Barry: a middle-sized man with bandy legs, a red face, and beaming countenance. He is well-dressed and self-confident.

In the scene, Judy the Fancy is sitting on the steps of a church, talking to Helen and her cousins. She tells them that Barry, a Justice of the Peace, is inside and she wants him to do a small favor for her. The cousins go inside and Barry is stretched out on a sofa. He tells Helen that he has come to see her and she is surprised. He is dressed in a short coat, white waistcoat, and tie. His sleeves and trousers reveal a margin of red wrist and grey stocking.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Judy the Fancy, and to establish her as a greedy, manipulative woman who uses her wit and her words to exploit those around her. The author also achieves the goal of establishing a contrast between Judy and the other characters in the scene, who are all well-dressed and well-to-do.
