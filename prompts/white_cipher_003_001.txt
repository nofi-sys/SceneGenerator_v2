Chester Fay is a former criminal who is now working for Scotland Yard. He is approached by a soldier who is looking for his hotel. Fay pretends to be a British citizen and offers to help the soldier find his way.
The two men walk to the square, where the soldier sees the red mass of the Huntington Temperance Hotel and realizes that Fay has been leading him in the wrong direction. The soldier confronts Fay, who admits that he is American and that he came to Europe without a uniform.
The soldier is skeptical of Fay's story, but Fay insists that he is telling the truth. He offers to buy the soldier a drink at a cafe in New York, and then leaves him at the hotel.
Fay hurries to a nearby antique shop, where he is let in by the owner, M. Clanson. Fay has stayed at the shop before, when he was being pursued by the police. He pays Clanson for a room for the night and then goes to bed.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is from Fay's perspective, and the tone is one of anxiety and fear.
