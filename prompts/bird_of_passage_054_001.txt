The purpose of this scene is to reveal the backstory of the protagonist's uncle, and to establish the conflict between him and the other characters in the story. The author achieves this by having the protagonist's cousin confide in her about the uncle's eccentricities, and how they have caused problems for the family.

The literary style of this scene is very formal and serious. The tone is somber and the point of view is third person limited.

Dido and her cousin Helen are sitting in Dido's room, discussing the financial situation of the family. Dido is upset because her father has been borrowing money from her, and she is now left with very little. Helen tries to comfort her, but Dido is adamant that the only way to solve the problem is to sell her cow, Daisy.
Helen is shocked at this idea, and tries to think of another solution. However, Dido is adamant that there is no other way. She then confesses to Helen that her father is eccentric and has been getting more so lately. Helen sympathizes with her, and they both agree that her father's mental state is the reason why she has been avoiding Mr. Halliday.
