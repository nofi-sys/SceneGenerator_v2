Donald Bartram and Tibby are out for a ride when Donald begins to question Tibby about her lack of seriousness. Tibby reflects on a time when she was serious and tells him about when she had an attack of quinsy and was diagnosed with diphtheria. Donald finds her candor bewitching and they continue to ride.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Donald and Tibby, and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. The author achieves this by showing Donald's initial interest in Tibby, and Tibby's ambivalence towards him.
