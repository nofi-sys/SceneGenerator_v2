The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two characters, and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. The author achieves this by having the two characters share their histories with each other, and by having them express their love for each other.

The literary style of this scene is very formal and old-fashioned. The tone is very serious and the point of view is third person omniscient.

Topham and the countess are alone in the countess's drawing room. Topham has just asked the countess to send away her duenna so that they can speak privately. The countess is surprised but agrees.
Topham tells the countess that he comes from an old Virginia family and that love has come to him suddenly and powerfully. He confesses that he has never felt this way before and declares his love for the countess.
The countess tells Topham that she loves him too but cannot marry him immediately. When Topham asks why, she says it is because of honor. Topham is surprised but the countess does not elaborate.
The countess kisses Topham and tells him that she will marry him eventually, but not right away. Topham is disappointed but agrees to wait.
