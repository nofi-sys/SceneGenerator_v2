The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by having the characters talk about their lives.

In the scene, two young men are talking in a third-story room of a tenement building. One young man, Larry Murphy, has just awakened and is stretching lazily. The other young man, Jimmie Larkin, is reading a pink sporting paper. They discuss the upcoming Solemn High Mass and the property holders who will be attending. Larry Murphy advises Jimmie Larkin not to say anything negative about the property holders when they are on the street. Jimmie Larkin tells Larry Murphy that he doesn't have to ask permission from a gang of Mocaraws to go to a ball. They discuss Jack Slattery, who was recently beaten up in a boxing match. Jimmie Larkin tells Larry Murphy about his upcoming trip South for boxing matches. He is excited about the prospect of becoming a main squeeze and having sporting guys come out from under their hats for him. Larry Murphy comments that drinking is a tough game to go up against. Jimmie Larkin tells Larry Murphy about a fight that happened at the club last night. Mart Kelly started to hammer Hogan after Hogan said Kelly's father was a stiff who had trun down the party. All is quiet in the street except for the sound of an accordion being played down the alley. A barb of yellow sunlight shines on a lithograph of the Virgin that Larry Murphy has tacked to the wall. He bought it years before because he thought it looked like his dead mother. Across the room is a large photograph of Jimmie Larkin in ring costume. Under the photograph is a policy slip with three numbers underscored, commemorative of the day that Jimmie Larkin struck the Hard Luck Row, at Levitskys policy shop, and got his name down upon the books of the tenth police district as a drunk and disorderly. Larry Murphy wonders aloud how the old man is, referring to Jimmie Larkin's father. Jimmie Larkin tells him that he saw Rosie OHara last night and she said that he was as good as gone.

The literary style of this scene is realistic, with a focus on the harsh realities of life. The tone is cynical and the point of view is third person limited.
