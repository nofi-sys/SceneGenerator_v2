The purpose of this scene is to introduce the characters of Miss Prenderghast and Elizabeth, and to establish the setting. The author achieves this by having the characters discuss their opinions of each other and their respective countries.

- The Cur: Formed Jean's taste, military service, delicate, raw, untrained nerves, morbid religious fancies.
- The doctor: Wishes he could have done his military service, thinks the Cur is a fool, modern science only goes by whats at the end of a stethoscope or microscope, doesn't allow for life forces.
- Ucelles: Long French windows, cold and vacant air, half blind and wholly dumb, needs all the sunshine of summer to help the observer to bear the freezing sense of departed life.
- Elizabeth: English maid, sourness, exiled mind, loves Jean.
- Miss Prenderghast: High neck, short ankles, knitting, robust conscience and anemic emotions, never considered in the light of a human being, a natural phenomenon of a disagreeable nature.

The scene opens with the Cur (a Catholic priest) and the doctor discussing the latter's military service. The Cur suggests that the doctor's taste should be considered, as he has formed Jean's taste. The doctor wishes that Jean had done his military service, as he is delicate. The two men then discuss science and faith, with the doctor asserting that science has tried to lead faith when it should have knelt before her.
They arrive at the house of Miss Prenderghast, an English spinster, and are greeted by her sour maid, Elizabeth. Elizabeth leads them to a small reception room, where they find Miss Prenderghast knitting. Miss Prenderghast tells Elizabeth to serve lunch, but Elizabeth says she will not do so until Jean comes.
The men discuss Miss Prenderghast, noting that she is a cold, unemotional woman. The Cur thinks to himself that English ladies have no temptations, which is why they are Protestants. The doctor reflects that they will have trouble with Jean sooner or later, as he has his father's blood in him.
Miss Prenderghast tells the men that it was kind of them to come, and they exchange pleasantries about the walk from St. Jouin. Miss Prenderghast then comments on the scarcity of wild flowers in the area.
