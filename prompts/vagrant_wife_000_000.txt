The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The point of view is third person omniscient.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Lilian Braithwaite and Annie Lane. Lilian is shown to be a confident, self-assured young woman who is not afraid to speak her mind. Annie is shown to be shy and reserved, and not quite as comfortable in social situations as Lilian is.

The scene takes place at a church, where a group of girls are being confirmed. Among them is Lilian Braithwaite, a beautiful 17-year-old. She is accompanied by her mother and brother, as well as by a young man named Stephen Lawler, who is deformed and uses crutches.
After the confirmation service, the crowd begins to disperse and Lilian's brother helps her put on her mantle. Stephen tells her that he wanted to see her in her white dress, and she scolds him for coming out despite his doctor's orders. Harry Braithwaite, Lilian's cousin, then admires another girl in the crowd, Annie Lane, the governess.
As the crowd begins to make their way to the door, it starts to rain heavily. Mrs. Mainwaring, the vicar's wife, is worried that her husband, who is outside in the carriage, will catch a cold. Harry Braithwaite offers to take her, Miss Lane, and the vicar in their own carriage to shelter them from the rain. Mrs. Mainwaring is hesitant at first, but decides to accept when Harry assures her that there is plenty of room.
Once they are in the carriage, Mrs. Mainwaring begins to worry that her husband will disapprove of her letting Miss Lane ride with them. However, Joan, her eldest daughter, points out that Miss Lane is a grown woman and can take care of herself. The vicar then arrives and they set off.
