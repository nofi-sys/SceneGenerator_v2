The style of this scene is very action-packed and fast-paced. There is also a lot of dialogue, which gives the reader a sense of what is happening.

-Dusty Britton: the commander of the Marandanian fleet, he is a tall man with broad shoulders and a deep voice. He is determined to find the barytrine generator and stop it.
-The barytrine operator: he is the one who locates the barytrine generator. He is hopeful as he watches the detector.
-Radar operators: they are the ones who try to make sense of the signal pips on the radar screens.
-Interceptors: they are the ones who try to rise to meet the Marandanian fleet, but are tossed madly in the racing shock-stream and lose ground.
-Junior Spacemen: they are the ones who are tasked with finding the barytrine generator. They are boys on bicycles and a few in cars driven by parents, scouring the landscape.
-Gant Nerley: he is the one who yells at Dusty Britton to stop as he races towards the blue haze.

- Thirteen Marandanian spacecraft are inching lower and lower into the atmosphere, causing a thunderous racket across the globe.
- Dusty Britton, commander of the fleet, orders the Junior Spacemen to find a hidden barytrine generator somewhere near the lower tip of Lake Michigan.
- The Junior Spacemen set out to find the generator, and Dusty eventually locates it himself.
- Dusty destroys the generator with a fluted-barrelled weapon, to the cheers of the Junior Spacemen.
