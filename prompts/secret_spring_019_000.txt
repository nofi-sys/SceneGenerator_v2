The Grand Duchess Aurora loved hunting, but preferred to do it alone, without any attendants. She would go out in the afternoon and return in the evening. On this particular day, she was accompanied by Count Marais and her dog. They rode to a rustic hut in the marsh and left their horses with the servants. They then set out on foot, with Marais's dog Dick and the Grand Duchess's dog Taras-Bulba.
They walked for a while, enjoying the scenery and the wildlife. The Grand Duchess was an excellent shot and managed to hit many birds. Marais was also a good shot, but preferred to stay behind and let the Grand Duchess do the shooting. They continued walking and eventually came to a stretch of marsh known as "La Cible".
The Grand Duchess was familiar with the area and knew all the different types of birds that lived there. She managed to shoot many of them, much to the delight of Count Marais. They continued walking and eventually made their way back to the hut. They mounted their horses and rode back to the castle, arriving in the evening.
