The scene opens with the five men--Teddy, Roy, Bug Eye, Pop, and Casey--in the truck on their way to the river. They are all excited about the journey they are about to take. They reach the river and unload the canoe. Roy and Bug Eye are to paddle first, while Teddy and Pop sit in the middle. They all say their goodbyes and set off. The canoe is soon loaded and ready to start. Roy and Bug Eye paddle while Teddy and Pop sit in the middle. They paddle for a while, admiring the scenery. After a while, they stop to rest and Roy asks Bug Eye about the river. Bug Eye tells him that it curves around to the left and then it's straight for a long stretch before the rough water starts.
