Jean sees Margot on the stage of a Revue and is surprised. He is further surprised when he realizes that she is singing his own song, "La plainte de lamour." The music fills him with emotions and he is no longer possessed by phantoms.

The style of this scene is intense and emotional. The point of view is from Jean's perspective, and the tone is one of anguish and despair. The setting is a light and airy Revue, but Jean sees it as a hollow and false facade. Margot's singing is the only thing that feels real to him.
The music is described as being "very clever, very neat, and topical and gay," but Jean does not pay attention to it because he knows it is not real. He is only interested in Margot, who he sees as the only thing in the Revue with any substance or reality. Her voice is described as being full of emotion and meaning, and it fills Jean with a sense of hope and freedom.
