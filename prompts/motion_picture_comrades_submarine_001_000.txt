The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is a hint of excitement in the boys' conversation, but overall the tone is fairly calm. The point of view is third person omniscient.

The boys are excited to be on their submarine voyage and are eager to explore all the sights they see. They spot a black steam yacht in the distance and wonder if it could be their rival, the _Dauntless_. Captain Barnaby Shooks comes up from the conning-tower and tells them it is time to go below for the night.
