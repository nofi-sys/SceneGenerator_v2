The style of this scene is very formal and polite. The tone is one of admiration and respect for the Grand Duchess, and there is a hint of romance between the narrator and Melusine. The point of view is third person limited, and the focus is on the narrator's interactions with the other characters.

The scene opens with the protagonist, Monsieur Vignerte, receiving an invitation to a dinner party in honor of the King of Wrtemberg and General von Eichhorn. Vignerte spends the afternoon in his room, not reading, and then goes for a walk in the park.
At the dinner party, Vignerte is seated between a major of the Dragoons and the wife of a Court Councillor, neither of whom speak to him. He cannot see the Grand Duchess, the King, or the Dukes from his seat, so he slips out and goes to the Great Hall.
There he meets Melusine von Graffenfried, who is dressing the room with flowers. They talk, and Vignerte confesses that he found her more attractive before he saw the Grand Duchess. Melusine laughs and says she will tell the Grand Duchess.
