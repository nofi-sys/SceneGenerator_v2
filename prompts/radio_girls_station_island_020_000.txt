The scene opens with the skipper finding the girls in the stateroom with smoke swirling around them. He goes below to investigate and finds a fire in the hold. He calls for the men to help him put it out, but it is difficult to do with the lack of steam. The wind also grows stronger, making it even harder to make progress. Burd is pessimistic about their chances of reaching shelter.
