- The scene takes place at a dinner table, where the conversation turns to Barry Sheridan's nephew, Mr. Lisle. 
- Barry Sheridan and his sister, Katie, tease their cousin, Helen, about her supposed attraction to Mr. Lisle. 
- Barry Sheridan then proceeds to badmouth Mr. Lisle, calling him a "great catch" and saying that he has a screw loose. 
- Helen defends Mr. Lisle, saying that he is a gentleman and a good conversationalist. 
- Barry Sheridan continues to boast about himself, while his sister and cousin try to calm him down.

The literary style of this scene is light-hearted and banterous. The tone is playful and there is a lot of good-natured teasing going on between the characters. The point of view is third person limited, and we only see into the thoughts of Dido.

-Barry Sheridan: a boastful, red-faced man who is clearly uncomfortable around women
-Helen: a cool, collected woman who is unimpressed by Barry's antics
-Dido: a fiery woman who is quick to defend Mr. Lisle's character
-Katie: a peacemaker, trying to smooth over the tension between Barry and the others
