The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Mrs. Wylie's belief in the supernatural and Mark's skepticism. Mrs. Wylie believes in the power of mind over matter, while Mark believes that all phenomena can be explained by natural causes. This conflict will be important to the development of the plot.

Alice is sitting in her room, brushing the wall with a broom. She is startled by something and looks back over her shoulder. Nellie comes in and asks her what is wrong. Alice says she can see horrible crawling things on the walls and they make her nervous. Nellie tries to calm her down and tells her it is just her imagination.
Mark comes in and tells them both that Alice has been reading books given to her by a spirit-medium and she has become interested in the supernatural. He is worried about her and asks Nellie to try to keep her mind off of these things. Mrs. Wylie comes in and says that she has seen more of this than she would like to admit. She tells them both about a friend of hers who is a medium and can do many wonderful things.
Mark says that he does not believe in the supernatural and that all of these phenomena can be explained by natural causes. Mrs. Wylie says that she is not sure but that all of it can be explained. The most mysterious thing to her is slate-writing. Mark says that he thinks it is just the medium's spirit acting on matter.
Mrs. Wylie says that if one mind can influence another, then it is possible for the mind or spirit of the dead to act after it is separated from the body.

The literary style of this scene is formal and scientific. The tone is serious and the point of view is objective.
