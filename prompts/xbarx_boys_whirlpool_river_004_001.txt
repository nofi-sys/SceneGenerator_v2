The scene opens with Teddy wondering how the girls on the 8 X 8 are doing. He decides to ride over to visit them as soon as his current business is finished. He fills a flour can and heads toward the house.
On the way, he thinks about the recent trouble they've had with rustlers and how the West is anything but a quiet place to live. He muses that they have a tough job ahead of them, but he's prepared for it.
When he gets to the house, he finds Roy and they discuss their plans. Nick is off getting information from a local puncher and they're waiting for him to return before they head out.
Suddenly, they hear a noise coming from behind the house and go to investigate. They find a strange contraption that Teddy recognizes as Bug Eye's car. The girls in the back are trying to suppress their laughter.
Bug Eye explains that it's his Fishmobile and Teddy is amazed.
