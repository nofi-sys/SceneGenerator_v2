The scene opens with American officer Hoppy confronting Englishman Dunton on board an American vessel. Hoppy informs Dunton that the vessel now belongs to the Americans and that Dunton and his men are now prisoners. Dunton is angered and calls on his officers to help him, but Hoppy warns them that he is armed and will not hesitate to kill them if they don't back down. Hoppy then proceeds to throw all the arms on board into the sea.
Dunton is furious and demands to know where his pistols are. Hoppy tells him that they are in safe keeping and that he will explain how he got them later. He then warns Dunton that he is being watched and that any further attempts to escape or resist will be met with force.
The scene ends with Hoppy informing Dunton that he will be delivered to the authorities in Eastham when the flats are dry. He tells Dunton that he is not to blame for the situation they are in and that he should be thankful that he is not being treated more harshly.
