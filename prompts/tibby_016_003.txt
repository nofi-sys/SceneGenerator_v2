-Donald: interested in the scene, forgets the humorous side, notices Esther's pale face and rigid body
-Esther: pale, rigid, vacant eyes, small and brown hands, exhausted after the waltz
-Russell: coarse, scheming, false, mesmerizing
-Mark: skeptical, staggered, removes the handkerchief from Esther's eyes, punctures her skin with a pin, concerned
-The company: hushed and expectant

The purpose of this scene is to show that Russell is a fraud and that he is using Esther for his own gain. The author also shows that Esther is a victim of Russell's manipulation.

The scene opens with Donald becoming interested in the spectacle before him and forgetting the humorous side. He sees Esther's face is pale and rigid and her hand is cold. He looks to Russell and sees that he is looking at Esther intently. The Professor gets up and moves his hands in front of Esther's face without touching her. He then takes a handkerchief from one of the gentlemen and ties it tightly over her eyes. All sit in hushed expectancy until Esther, rising from her chair, glides like a phantom to the middle of the floor. She begins humming a soft, slow waltz and floats around the room, avoiding the chairs and other articles in her way without losing step or breaking time. The girl continues dancing for ten minutes before she is led out of the room by unseen hands and throws herself, apparently exhausted, upon a small lounge in the adjoining apartment. Russell enters the room and sees Mark bending over Esther. He coarsely comments on the situation and then attempts to wake her. Mark is beginning to fear that the sleep is one which would find its awakening in another world, when Russell enters the room. Russell places his hand upon the girl's brow and says that she is waking up now. Esther, to Mark's delight, arises to a sitting posture, passes her hands several times over her eyes as if striving to collect her thoughts, and seeing only Mark present, asks plaintively what has happened. She looks about the room in a bewildered way and, hearing the sound of voices from the adjoining apartment, turns and bury's her face upon the lounge, bursting into hysterical weeping. Mark springs to her side and tries to comfort her. Esther asks if she has been dancing again and if the "horrible, horrible man" has made her into a waltzing puppet for the people to laugh at. Mark assures her that there was nothing ridiculous or laughable in her dancing and that he believes she is entirely unconscious when she performs the feat. He also tells her that her hands are sometimes placed as though she were dancing with a partner.
