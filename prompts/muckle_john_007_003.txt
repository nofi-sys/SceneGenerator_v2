-Rob: young boy, exhausted from running
-Muckle John: older man, helping Rob escape
-Highlanders: pursuers, armed with claymores
-Ephraim Macaulay: leader of the Highlanders

Muckle John and Rob are being pursued by a group of Highlanders. John leads Rob up a hill to the summit, where they are seen, and the pursuers give chase. John and Rob make a run for it, but Rob falls and John has to carry him. They make it to a cul-de-sac, where John sets Rob down and tells him to climb up the cliff face. Rob does so, while John holds off their pursuers. They make it to the top and escape.

The purpose of this scene is to create suspense and tension as the protagonist, Rob, tries to escape his pursuers. The author achieves this by having Rob narrowly escape being hit by a rock, and then by having him climb up a slippery cliff face with no margin for error.
