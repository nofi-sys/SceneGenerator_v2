The style of this scene is very casual and conversational. There is a lot of dialogue between the characters, and the author uses short, simple sentences. The tone is somewhat ominous and foreboding, and the point of view is third person limited.

Rob, a young man, is in the company of a gipsy named Gloom. They are in the Highlands of Scotland, and have just come across a stream. They knock on the door of a woman's house, and Rob asks her if Invernenty is home. The woman says he is not, and Rob is suspicious.
The gipsy and the young man set up camp, and during the day, several Macgregors come and stare at them. In the afternoon, Rob goes with Gloom to see what the Macgregors are up to.
They are handling a smooth stone with holes for fingers, and trying to lift it onto a small rock. Rob sees a tall, dark man watching them from a distance, and he is sure the man knows who he is. The man is James More, son of Rob Roy, and he is new from Culloden.
Later, a tall, gaunt woman comes to speak to Gloom in private. She is John Maclaren, and she tells him that James is up to his old tricks and the clan is scared of Rob.
Gloom decides they must leave, and they pack up their camp and head for Strathyre. As they approach Castle Murdoch, a man's voice calls out to them, asking who they are. It is Murdoch, the owner of the castle.
Murdoch invites them in, and they follow him into the courtyard. He is a white-haired man with a limp, and he tells them they are not welcome there.
