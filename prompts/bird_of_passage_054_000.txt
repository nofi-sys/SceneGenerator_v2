In a large room, Helen, Katie, and old Biddy are preparing food for a market. They are laughing and joking while they work. Darby, the butler, comes in and talks to Helen. He is sly and seems to be up to something. Helen goes to the office to find her cousin Dido. Dido is crying at her desk. Helen asks her what is wrong. Dido explains that she is struggling to keep the family out of debt and it is proving to be too much for her. She has received a bill for eleven pounds that she was not expecting and does not have the money to pay it. Helen tells her to let Uncle pay the bill. Barry has told her that the family income is a thousand pounds a year.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a mix of dialogue and narration. The tone is one of mild frustration, as Helen tries to get to the bottom of why her cousin is upset. There is a hint of suspicion in her questioning of Darby, but overall the mood is fairly light. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Helen's perspective.
