The scene opens with a description of a distress signal sent by Dusty Britton, an actor and owner of a schooner, from off the coast of Baja California. The signal is picked up by the United States Coast Guard, who dispatch a search and rescue squad. The squad finds the schooner in good condition and Britton and an unknown woman on board, waving and seemingly unharmed.
The Coast Guard cutter arrives and Britton tells his story of a Galactic Civilization called Marandis that is moving the Earth to another sun because our position interferes with their program of running Galactic Highways back and forth across the trackless wastes of space. The scientists interviewed following this claim are skeptical, but Dr. Foster of the Wellmann Observatory suggests that enough of Dusty Britton's story is logical to make it sound good.
The scene ends with a description of the press conference held at Arlington, Virginia, where the Federal Communications Commission declares the signal false and Dusty Britton is asked to show just cause for emitting such a report.

The style of this scene is journalistic. It is written in a dry, matter-of-fact tone and is full of factual details. There is no hint of emotion or opinion.
