Jean is meeting with Madame, who is asking him to write invitations for Louis' ball. Jean is hesitant, as he does not get along with Louis. Madame explains that Louis is just misunderstood and has a heart of gold. She also mentions that Louis has a great vanity - he believes himself to be clever and would rather be thought guilty of a crime than of a mistake.
Jean starts to understand Louis better and agrees to write the invitations. He is also touched by Madame's words about Louis' feelings for him. Just then, the butler announces the arrival of Madame Salvi.
