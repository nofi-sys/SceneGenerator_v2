The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the two main characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by having the two characters interact with each other.

- Hi and the man who helped him escape from prison are walking through the city
- The man is carrying a long, heavy ebony ruler
- They hear singing from the direction of the prison yard and Hi recognizes the voice as Henery Peach Kezia
- The man says they should go around the fire to avoid being seen
- They turn up a road and the man asks Hi where he's going
- Hi says he's going to Anselmo, and the man says he knows the way
- They walk in silence for a while and Hi notices the man's eyes are fixed on him strangely
- The man suddenly asks Hi if he's a damn sight too nosy

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of mystery and danger. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is somewhat ominous.
