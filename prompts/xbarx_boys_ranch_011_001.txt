The scene opens with two boys, Roy and Teddy, walking slowly towards a corral. Roy asks Teddy how he is feeling, and Teddy says that he is feeling better but that he misses their horse, Flash. Roy says that he feels the same about his horse, Star, and that they just have to be patient and wait for the right time to take action.
Teddy then asks about the two girls that are coming to visit, and Roy tells him that they will be arriving soon. Teddy seems excited about the prospect of seeing the girls again, and the two boys make their way to the corral to start working.
As they are working, they hear the sound of a car approaching. They recognize the voice of the driver as Pete Ball, and they watch as he arrives with the two girls, Nell and Ethel.
The scene ends with the four of them talking and getting to know each other better.
