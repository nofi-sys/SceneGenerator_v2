Hugh McClintock is preparing to face down the notorious outlaw Sam Dutch, who has killed many men. He oils his revolver and tries to psych himself up, reminding himself that Dutch is no different from any other man. He sneaks up to Dutch's cabin and waits outside, planning to shoot him when he comes out. However, Dutch is more cautious than Hugh expects, and he and his companion William Buckley sneak into the cabin through the back door. Hugh follows them and shoots them both through the window.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Hugh McClintock and to show how he overcomes his fears. The author achieves this by having Hugh face his fears head-on and then using his intelligence to come up with a plan to defeat his opponent.

The literary style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of fear and dread.
