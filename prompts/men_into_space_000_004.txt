-McCauley turns around to inspect the rocket one last time before launch
-He climbs into the rocket and is strapped in
-The nose-cone door is closed and he is left alone
-He hears a voice in his earphones checking in

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of McCauley and to set up the situation he will be in for the rest of the story. We learn that he is a methodical man who is careful and detail-oriented. We also learn that he is nervous about the height, even though he is only a few feet off the ground. This foreshadows the challenges he will face later in the story.

-Randy: McCauley's friend and co-worker. He is worried about the launch but tries to act nonchalant.

-The fueling crew: They are finished with their work but stay to watch McCauley launch.
-The man in the blockhouse: He is in charge of the launch.
-The civilian motorist: He is upset about being kept off the test site.
