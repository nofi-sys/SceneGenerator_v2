The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Hal Falkner and to foreshadow the conflict between him and the McCoys. Falkner is established as a dangerous, sullen man with a quick temper. The conflict between him and the McCoys is foreshadowed by his comment about postponing any plans to escape, "but, take it from me, they are merely postponed."

The literary style of this scene is wistful and suspenseful. The tone is one of admiration for Ruth's husband, mixed with a sense of foreboding. The point of view is third person limited.

Ruth McCoy has come to see Hal Falkner in jail, in hopes that he will tell her what he knows about the shooting of her husband, Dan Gilroy. Falkner is initially hostile, but Ruth persists, telling him that she knows he is a good man despite his reputation. Falkner relents, and tells her that he knows who started the shooting and who killed Dan Gilroy. He also tells her that her husband, Rowan McCoy, is a good man.
