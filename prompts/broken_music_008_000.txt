The child, Margot, is sitting on a box in an alley, looking frightened. Jean, a young man, comes and sits down next to her, and tells her that he knows she is in trouble and alone. Margot denies it, but Jean insists, saying that he has heard Monsieur Picot speak to her in a way that shows he is taking advantage of her. Jean says he wants to help Margot, and asks what he can do. Margot is surprised, and asks why he would want to help her. Jean explains that he is a musician and an artist, and that he feels sympathy for Margot because she is in a difficult situation. Margot says she has often seen Jean at the theater where she works, and has wondered what he does there. Jean tells her that he is a struggling artist and that he has a plan to help her. Margot is skeptical, but Jean explains that he wants to train her voice so she can become a successful singer. Margot is surprised and delighted, and agrees to let Jean train her voice.
