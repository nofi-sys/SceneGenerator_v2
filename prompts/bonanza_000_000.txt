The style of this scene is straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is no attempt at poetic language or flowery description. The focus is on the action and the dialogue, with a few brief details about the setting and the characters.

1. Byers: small and wiry, hard as nails, seething with impatience
2. the fat station keeper: sings lugubriously and tunelessly, chewing tobacco
3. the wrangler: holding a second saddled horse, bitter about the delay
4. Old Grimes (deceased): single-breasted coat, buttoned down before, hair inclined to gray, wore it in a queue
5. the stableman: interjects at the end of a stanza
