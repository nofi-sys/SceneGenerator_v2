The scene opens with Hi Ridden, a young man, admiring the beauty of Carlotta Valdes. He is struck by her perfection and notes her long eyebrows, deep brown hair, and kind eyes. Carlotta is amused by Hi's staring and comments on the English tendency to "want to do things." She then asks him to play tennis with her after lunch.
Rosa, Carlotta's maid, interrupts to say that lunch is ready. As they walk to the dining room, Carlotta asks Hi about his work cutting out Easter dresses. Hi complains that women always make men slaves.
At lunch, the conversation turns to Carlotta's singing. She sings a couple of Spanish songs, one strange and the other grim. Hi is entranced by her voice.
After lunch, they go out to play tennis. Hi is still struck by Carlotta's beauty and wonders if he could take anything of hers as a souvenir. He notices her hands and sees that she is wearing an engagement ring. This makes him feel jealous of the man who is engaged to her, and he wonders if he could fight him for her.
The scene ends with Carlotta and Hi going back inside.

The style of this scene is very descriptive, with long, detailed sentences about Carlotta's appearance. The point of view is from Hi's perspective, and the tone is one of awe and admiration.
