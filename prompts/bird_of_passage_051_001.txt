Sally and Andy come running into the kitchen, telling Dido and her aunt about a terrible experience they had. Katie and Helen follow them and discover that they saw a ghost.

- Katie: A young girl who is very loyal to her family. She is also quite naïve and doesn’t seem to understand the gravity of certain situations.
- Dido: Katie’s older sister. She is more level-headed than Katie but has also experienced a great disappointment in her life.
- Mr. Halliday: Dido’s former lover. He is a kind and good man, but was ultimately rejected by her family.
- Malachi Sheridan: Katie and Dido’s father. He is a very successful man who is very protective of his daughters.
- Biddy: A maid who works for the Sheridans. She is very gossipy and likes to keep up with the goings-on in the household.
- Sally: Another maid who works for the Sheridans. She is very superstitious and is easily scared.
- Andy: Sally’s husband. He is also very superstitious and is easily scared.

The style of this scene is very melodramatic, with a touch of the supernatural. The characters are all very emotional, and the dialogue is full of exclamations and rhetorical questions.
