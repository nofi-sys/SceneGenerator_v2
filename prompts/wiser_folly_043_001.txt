- David and Elizabeth are by a stream
- David is telling Elizabeth about a time when he was younger and read Tennyson's "The Holy Grail"
- He talks about how he used to play make-believe and it has come back to him now
- Elizabeth tells him that what he is experiencing is real

The literary style of this scene is very poetic and romantic. The tone is dreamy and mystical, and the point of view is first person.

Elizabeth: She is a kind and gentle woman who is very wise. She has a soft voice and is very patient.
David: He is a young man who is struggling with an internal conflict. He is torn between what he knows is real and what his heart is telling him.
