The sheriff, district attorney, and another man arrive on the island where the murder took place. Bassett tells them his story and shows them the scene of the shooting. They then go to the house where the rest of the island's occupants are gathered. Rawson questions them and then they all go back to the mainland.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the characters of the sheriff and the district attorney, and to establish the setting of the story. The author achieves these goals by having the characters discuss the murder case and the location of the crime.
