-Captain Barnaby Shooks: an old mariner who is the commander of the low _Argonaut_
-Ballyhoo: a boy who is on the _Argonaut_ and strikes up an intimate acquaintance with the captain
-Oscar: a boy on the _Argonaut_ who is Ballyhoo's friend
-the officer: an officer from a black destroyer who came aboard the _Argonaut_ to look over the ship's papers

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and simple. There is no real authorial voice present, and the point of view is third person omniscient. The tone is mostly neutral, although there is a hint of excitement in the boys' conversation about the possibility of being followed by the other boat.

- The scene is set on a black steam yacht, evidently capable of making much faster time than the low _Argonaut_. 
- Ballyhoo and the captain have struck up an intimate acquaintance, and the captain has just told them that the yacht following them is the _Dauntless_, their rival in the salvage trade. 
- Ballyhoo is dismayed at the prospect of being followed, but Oscar assures him that they will be fine. 
- The boys do not go on deck again after their meal, and they have a difficult time sleeping in their cramped quarters. 
- In the morning, they discover that they have passed Fortress Monroe and are now being followed by a cutter from a black destroyer. 
- The officer aboard looks over the ship's papers and asks many questions, then bids the captain good luck and good bye. 
- The engines begin to throb and the boat to quiver, and the boys look back at the shore they are leaving.
