The style of this scene is conversational and light-hearted. There is a touch of humor in the way the captain refers to Archie's "hobbledehoy" days, and in the description of Sarah as the "genuine ore" that Archie found in Sydney. The tone is friendly and good-natured, and the point of view is third person limited, focusing on Archie's perspective.
