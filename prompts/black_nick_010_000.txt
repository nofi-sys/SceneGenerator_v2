The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of the supernatural or the paranormal, despite the mention of the "Mountain Devil." The tone is one of calm observation, and the point of view is third-person omniscient.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Adrian Schuyler and to introduce the legend of the Mountain Devil.

1. A small party of horsemen, led by Adrian Schuyler, are reconnoitering near the town of Bennington.
2. The scout in front of the party spots a camp of Baum and his Hessians, and Schuyler takes a look at it through a telescope.
3. Schuyler and the scout discuss the legend of the "Mountain Devil," a mysterious figure who has been terrorizing the area lately.
