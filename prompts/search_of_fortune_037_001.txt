The scene is set on a sheep station in Australia, where the sheep are being shorn. Findlayson, a visitor to the station, comments on how dangerous it is for the Joukie-daidles (sheep) to be around the child, Diana. He shows Bob how to build a fauld (enclosure) to keep her safe. 
The men are busy at the washing-ground, trying to wash the sheep. The sheep are being difficult, and the men are having a hard time. Diana is watching from her fauld, cheering the men on. 
Suddenly, the kangaroo escapes from its enclosure and starts running around. The sheep start running too, and Diana is in danger of being trampled. Bounce, the collie dog, tries to herd the sheep away from her, but it's not enough. Findlayson manages to grab Diana and pull her to safety just in time. 
Everyone is relieved that Diana is safe. Bob scolds the kangaroo and puts it back in its enclosure. They all go back to work, with Diana safely out of harm's way.
