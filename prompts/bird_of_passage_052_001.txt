In the scene, Mr. Sheridan is convincing Helen and her cousins of the feasibility of his latest invention - wings that will allow humans to fly. He is eager to test them out and does so successfully, though in the darkness. His daughter Dido is unimpressed and he scolds her for her lack of appreciation for money.

The purpose of this scene is to establish Mr. Sheridan as a eccentric character who is passionate about his work. The author achieves this by having him give a long, enthusiastic speech about his invention and then abruptly end the conversation in the dark.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its dramatic and intense tone. The point of view is from an omniscient third person, and the language is highly descriptive. Mr. Sheridan's enthusiasm is evident in the way he speaks to the girls, and the girls' reactions are also described in detail. The overall effect is one of suspense and excitement.
