The tone of this scene is one of haggling and negotiation. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Hi's perspective. The style is straightforward and matter-of-fact.

A man wants to hire a horse for two days and offers one English sovereign. The woman agrees to lend a horse, saddled and bridled, for two days, for one English sovereign and all the small change the man has. The horse is a sour-coloured pony who is rough-haired and has not been shod or had his feet pared.
