The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two main characters, McCoy and Ruth. The author achieves this by showing how they react to each other in a crowd and when they are alone.

The scene opens with the outlaw bronco Tenderfoot trying its best to buck off its rider, McCoy. Ruth Trovillion watches from the stands, fascinated. She can tell that McCoy is an experienced rider, and that he has the situation under control. The bronco eventually tires and McCoy is declared the winner.
After the victory, McCoy goes to speak with Ruth in the stands. He is humble about his win, but Ruth is adamant that he was the best rider. They part ways, but not before Ruth makes it clear that she would like to see him again.
Later, Ruth and McCoy are separated from their friends in the crowded streets of Bad Ax. They wander together, and the atmosphere between them grows more charged. Eventually they find themselves alone under the stars, and Ruth allows McCoy to touch her gown in the darkness.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by a focus on detail, a close third person point of view, and a tense, suspenseful atmosphere.
