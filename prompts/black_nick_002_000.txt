The literary style of this scene is characterized by its tone, which is at once flirtatious and respectful, as well as by its point of view, which is from the perspective of the hussar. Additionally, the language is somewhat formal, befitting the setting of an encounter between a gentleman and a lady.

-The Rock Nymph: a beautiful girl who looks like a statue of Diana, the goddess of hunting. She has a haughty and insulted aspect, but her expression softens when she sees the young hussar.
-The hussar: a young, dashing soldier. He is unafraid of the dogs and bear, and admires the Rock Nymph. He is a skilled man of the world, and takes advantage of the situation to flatter the girl.

The scene opens with the hussar, a young officer, being accosted by a girl who is the mistress of a menagerie including hounds, a black bear, and fawns. The girl resembles a statue of Diana, the patroness of hunting, and is armed with a bow and quiver. The hussar remains calm in the face of the animals, and the girl eventually approaches him.
The girl is surprised that the hussar knows her name, and he explains that the beauty of Diana is famous. The girl is further amazed when the hussar tells her that he knows her mountain is haunted by a demon, but that he never dreamed the demon would be so beautiful.
The hussar then explains that he is on the mountain because he is looking for the lost city of Atlantis. The girl is skeptical, but the hussar tells her that he has a map that will lead him to the city. The girl is still skeptical, but she is also curious, and she agrees to show the hussar the way to the city.
