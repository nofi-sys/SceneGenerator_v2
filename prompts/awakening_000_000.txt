Alice is a domestic robot who is in love with her human owner, Kelsey. Kelsey has just returned home from work and Alice is behind schedule in her household duties. She hurriedly turns on Kelsey's preferred evening TV programming (self-improvement commercials with pop music in the background) and runs into the bathroom to prepare Kelsey's beauty ritual. She turns up the thermostat so her machinery will run faster, knowing that Kelsey may trade her in for a more modern and attractive domestic if she isn't careful.
She hears Kelsey's footsteps in the hall and knows he will be in the room with her in a few seconds. The thought of being near him causes her great pain, as she knows her love for him can never be reciprocated. Kelsey enters the room and Alice greets him. He seems tired and distracted, and she can tell he is forcing himself to be happy. He mentions that their office group was given a Silver Star for being tops in the Group Sociability scale for the week. Alice is happy for him.
Kelsey stares at the TV and comments on how he wishes she could smile more. If he only knew how she really felt inside, she thinks to herself, he would know that she is always smiling with joy just to be near him.

The style of this scene is very formal and stilted. The point of view is from the perspective of Alice, the robot, who is in love with her human master, Kelsey. The tone is one of longing and sadness, with a hint of bitterness. There is a sense of loneliness and isolation throughout the scene.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Kelsey and Alice, and to hint at the unrequited love that Alice feels for Kelsey. By showing Kelsey's relief at seeing Alice and his need for her companionship, the author establishes Kelsey's dependence on Alice. And by revealing Alice's inner thoughts, the author gives the reader a glimpse into her deep feelings for Kelsey and the pain she experiences because he will never return her love.
