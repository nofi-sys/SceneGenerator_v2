The scene is set in a house during a storm. The children are inside, around the fireplace, while the adults are busy with various tasks. Rosie is popping corn, Laura is toasting macaroons, Silva and Maida are making molasses candy, and the boys are fanning it to cool it down. The little children are running about, playing or looking at books. Mrs. Dore is rocking Delia, who has fallen asleep. Granny Flynn is reading from her Lives of the Saints.
Rosie exclaims that she can't believe summer is over. Laura agrees, saying that the warm weather up to now made her think autumn would never come. Silva says that autumn arrives when the goldenrod and asters bloom. Maida mournfully agrees, saying that the flowers coming and going makes one aware of how quickly summer is passing.
Arthur and Dicky say that the storm makes them think of fall, and Harold says it makes him think of school. Everybody groans. Rosie suggests that the popcorn and apples may be responsible for their somber mood, but then says that she feels like it is Halloween night. They all begin to reminisce about the Halloween party at Laura's house last year.
Rosie says that next Sunday night means going back to Charlestown and Monday morning means school again. She says that the thing she will miss most is her little room outdoors. Tyma Burle says that if the cave had been a Mammoth Cave, people would have been coming all the time to look at it and it wouldn't be their cave anymore. He says that he has enjoyed playing tennis the most this summer. Laura says that she doesn't wonder he likes tennis, since he can beat everybody at it.

The purpose of this scene is to show the contrast between the outside world and the inside of the house on a stormy night. The author also uses the scene to highlight the contrast between summer and fall.
