The style of this scene is lighthearted and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person omniscient.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two factions of the hockey team, and to introduce the character of Starling Meyer. The author achieves these goals by having the characters discuss the reasons for the team's poor performance, and by having them debate whether or not Meyer is to blame.

- Ned Musgrave says that the trouble began when Yetter was made captain.
- Bert Winslow says that Meyer is a peach of a hockey player but also a peach of a trouble-maker.
- Roy Dresser asks why they didn't elect Gus Weston.
- Pop Driver says that Meyer pulled all the strings he could.
- Musgrave says that more than three-fourths of the team wanted Meyer for captain long before the election.
- Nick Blake makes a joke at Driver's expense.
- Jimmy takes advantage of a lull in the discussion to tell a joke about Dud.
