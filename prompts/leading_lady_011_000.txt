1. Rawson: a lean man, exultant, with a light face
2. Bassett: worried, with lifted brows
3. Williams: craned neck, also worried

The literary style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person omniscient, and the tone is one of mystery and intrigue.

The scene takes place in a summer-house that is covered in Virginia creeper. Rawson finds some scraps of gold material caught in the table legs and wonders if they came from Miss Saunders' sash. Bassett and Williams agree that they probably did, which means that Miss Saunders was in the summer-house before she was shot. Rawson theorizes that she was scared by someone with a pistol and jumped up, tearing the fringe off her sash as she ran. They all agree that this means the person who shot her was in the summer-house with her and that it was not an accidental meeting.
