Lovat, an exiled Scottish chief, is being pursued by two men. He and his companion, Rob, come across a pony and Lovat mounts it. They are soon joined by two more men, Fraser by their tartan. The four of them continue on towards the west. Lovat turns back to look at Gortuleg one last time before they leave. The men are eventually joined by a third man and they continue running towards Knoidart.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Lovat and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. Lovat is shown to be a complex character--he is capable of both great cruelty and great sentimentality. He is also shown to be a master manipulator, able to play on the emotions of those around him.
The conflict that is established is between Lovat and his son, the Master. Lovat is shown to be a rebel, while the Master is shown to be an upstanding member of society. This conflict will drive the rest of the story as Lovat tries to regain his power and position.
