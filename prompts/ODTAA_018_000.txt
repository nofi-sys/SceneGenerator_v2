The scene opens with the German coming slowly towards Hi, waving with his left arm. He tells Hi to mind out at the ford, and Hi thanks him for his help. The German turns back to his hoeing and Hi sets out upon his path.
When he is out of sight of the settlement, Hi begins to wonder what the German meant by his warning. He wonders if there is danger of highwaymen at the ford, or if the floods are out. The question of how far Anselmo is also arises, and Hi decides he can make it there by 5 or 5.30.
He whacks up the horse into a solitude of rocky barren, densely grown with small thorn and prickly pear. The strangeness of the landscape and the eagles cruising for their prey make his ride a dream of delight for some miles. However, the landscape grows more ominous as he rides on, with the pudding-cactus exuding over his path and the prevalence of snakes in the puddles. The noise of the horse's hooves echoing in the rocks grows louder and louder.
Looking back, Hi sees that a horse and man are following him. He is certain it is Bright Tooth, and the horse looks like the dark chestnut mare he saw in the stable. Bright Tooth calls to Hi to stop, but Hi rides on. Bright Tooth presses his horse up to His off quarter and calls out that Hi is to give back the horse or pay good money. Hi refuses, and Bright Tooth makes a grab for his rein. The yellow horse shies away and Hi is nearly off. He recovers first and pulls out his knife, poking it towards Bright Tooth and calling out a warning. Bright Tooth whips out his own knife with a long, sharp blade.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Hi and Bright Tooth, and to set up the stakes of the story. Hi is on his way to Anselmo, and Bright Tooth is trying to stop him. The conflict is established when Bright Tooth tries to grab Hi's reins, and Hi pulls out his knife. The stakes are established when Bright Tooth pulls out his own knife, which is much larger and sharper than Hi's.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is from Hi's perspective, and the tone is one of danger and threat.
