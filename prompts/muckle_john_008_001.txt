The style of this scene is very formal and stilted. The dialogue is stiff and the characters seem to be speaking in a very rehearsed way. There is a sense of tension and foreboding throughout the scene.

Muckle John and Rob are stopped by Captain Campbell, who is curious about their identity and what they are doing in the area. Muckle John tells him they are on the trail of the rebel leaders and are looking for Lord Lovat. Captain Campbell tells him that the Duke of Cumberland is also looking for Lovat and that he is considered a very important target. Muckle John and Rob thank him for the information and continue on their way.
