The literary style of this scene is straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is no hint of irony or sarcasm, and the tone is relatively neutral. The point of view is third-person limited, focused on the protagonist.

The captain of a ship visits two men who are being held captive in the hold. He is impressed by the one man's strength and character, and asks if he is a navigator. The man says he can take the sun for latitude, but is not a good navigator. The captain then turns to the other man, who is still shaken from a nightmare, and asks how he was able to defeat his second mate in a fight. The man explains that he knows jiu jitsu and was able to use it to his advantage. The captain is impressed and decides to let the two men go.
