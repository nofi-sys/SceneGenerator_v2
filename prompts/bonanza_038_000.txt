The scene opens with two men, Browning and McClintock, sitting in a French restaurant in Austin, discussing their investigation into the death of William Thornton. They have been unable to find any evidence of foul play, but they have a lead that Thornton had a brother named Chug.
They go to a local saloon to ask around about Chug, and they learn that he died about two years ago. They also learn that the two brothers were very different from each other, and that they hadn't spoken in years.
The next stop is the local newspaper office, where they look through the back issues for any mention of Chug's death. They find an article from two years ago that mentions both brothers' deaths. They also learn that the two brothers had very similar names.
Hugh has an intuition that he is on the edge of an important discovery, but he doesn't know what it is.
