The style of this scene is light-hearted and humorous, with a touch of suspense. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is playful.

In the scene, two friends are trapped after an experiment goes wrong. One is shrunken to three inches tall, while the other has grown to twenty feet tall. They are unable to move or communicate their situation to anyone. 
Luckily, their colleague Clarissa Wilkins comes in and, after some confusion, is able to reverse the machine and return them to normal.
