The style of this scene is conversational and intimate. The point of view is from Tibby's perspective, and the tone is one of longing and nostalgia.

-Tibby: a young girl with red-brown curls. She is small and has a expressive face. She is good-natured and likes to help others.
-Tom: a boy who is Tibby's brother. He is good-natured and agile. He is also a bit of a jokester.
-The driver: a man who is driving a carriage. He is forced to stop when the carriage breaks. He is practical and efficient.
-The lady: a small, dainty woman who is accompanied by a yellow-haired boy. She is well-dressed and seems to be from a wealthy background. She is also kind and compassionate.

The scene opens with Tibby tossing her red-brown curls and pursing up her small mouth expressively. She remembers her quest to find a toad for her brother Tom andboosts him up into the tree to capture the singer. The toad is a dull gray and looks homely to Tibby. The scene then shifts to a glittering carriage coming down the hill and breaking near the end of the bridge. The driver asks for supplies to repair the carriage from Tom and Tibby. A small lady and yellow-haired boy then enter the scene. The lady sits under the shade of the tree and Tibby tells her of her brothers and sisters. The boy becomes restless and Tibby tells him of the little singing toad in the tree-top and of the twittering squirrels to calm him. He falls asleep in her arms. Tibby then gazes upon the lady's outfit and feels the contrast between her own attire and the city-bred woman's. The woman senses Tibby's desire to have dainty boots and beautiful gowns and offers to take her back to the city with her to help care for her son. Tibby accepts the offer and the scene ends.
