The style of this scene is very emotional and intense. Lady Mary is clearly distraught and Father Maloney is trying to comfort her. The language is also quite formal and old-fashioned.

Father Maloney is overjoyed to find a yellow parchment that has been hidden for years. He believes it is a miracle. Lady Mary is silent, overwhelmed by the discovery. Father Maloney speculates that the old Sir Antony was up to something when Henry found him. He also believes that the boy (referring to Lady Mary's son) will be found before sundown. Lady Mary is afraid that it may be too late. Father Maloney reassures her that if it is two miracles that are needed, God will work them. Lady Mary confesses that she may not have given up everything wholeheartedly and that she still held onto the idea of the Castle in her mind. Father Maloney tells her not to worry, that God knows the human side of us well enough and wasn't holding her to account for any little weakness. He reassures her that her son is safe and that if he isn't, it is no punishment to her. Lady Mary is relieved and grateful.
