The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Miss Macpherson and Major Fraser, and to set up the stakes of the story. Miss Macpherson is trying to figure out what to do about the situation with Rob, and she is clearly not happy with Major Fraser.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Culloden, the English government is offering a reward for the capture of any rebel Scots who participated in the uprising. Miss Macpherson, a distant relative of one such rebel, Rob Fraser, reads the notice with horror and dismay. She knows that if he is caught, he will be executed.
She goes to the tavern of Major James Fraser (who is related to Rob's father), hoping to find some help or information. Instead, she finds that he is the one who turned Rob in to the authorities. Enraged, she berates him for his betrayal.
Major Fraser is unapologetic, and tries to convince Miss Macpherson that it is all for the best. He insists that the rebellion will eventually blow over and that Rob will be forgotten. Miss Macpherson is not convinced, and leaves in a fury.
