The purpose of this scene is to establish the plan that the captain and the boys have for exploring the sunken ship. The author also establishes the setting and gives some information about the characters.

The scene opens with the captain coming aboard and the Camera Boys eagerly questioning him. He tells them that they have likely found the wreck they were looking for, and that he plans to stay by it until morning. He also says that they will be allowed to come up to the surface for the night, but that all lights must be extinguished and silence must be kept.
The boys then discuss the captain's plans among themselves. They surmise that he is worried about Captain Badger, a known adventurer and trickster, and that he wants to be sure they are not seen by him. They also speculate on the captain's plans for the next day, guessing that he will use a float to work on the wreck.
The scene ends with the captain announcing that they will be going back up to the surface.
