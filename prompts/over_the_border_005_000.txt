A man and his wife are aboard a yacht with Ella Madison and George Lance. Ella is pregnant and about to give birth, and the man tells Dunbar (Lance's right-hand man) about the situation. Dunbar is shocked, but doesn't say anything. Later, when the baby is born, it goes missing and Lance is nowhere to be found. The man suspects that Lance killed the baby to keep it from ruining his reputation.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the character of Dunbar and to establish the conflict between him and Lance. The author achieves this by having Dunbar discover that Lance is the father of Ella's child, which he had previously suspected.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the focus is on the characters of Dunbar and Lance. The tone is one of foreboding and dread.
