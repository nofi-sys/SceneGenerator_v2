The literary style of this scene is characterized by its suspenseful tone and use of dialogue to further the plot. The point of view is third person omniscient, which allows the reader to see into the thoughts of the characters.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Manton and to foreshadow the events to come. Manton is established as a skeptical and cold-hearted man, who is not to be trusted. The scene also foreshadows the fact that Manton will be visited by the woman in a clairvoyant state, and that she will later be found dead.

Manton is in his room when he is suddenly visited by a woman in a clairvoyant state. She accuses him of not treating her right and of neglecting her needs, and says that the people in Heaven are complaining about him. Manton is amused and dismissive at first, but when the woman starts to say that he doesn't give her money, he loses his temper and kicks her out.
Two hours later, he returns to find the woman's daughter, Elna, in a state of hysterics. She tells him that her mother is dead, and Manton realizes that he left her in a clairvoyant state without making any effort to wake her up. He quickly does so, and the woman is none the worse for wear.
Manton is deeply repentant for his suspicions and for his treatment of the woman, and he is left with a newfound respect for the art of clairvoyance.
