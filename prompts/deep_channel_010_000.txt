The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Mr. Bixby as a shy, unassuming man who is often overlooked by others. The author also uses the scene to contrast the attitudes of the different characters towards the war. Elizabeth is tired of hearing about the war, while the reverend gentleman is patriotic and wants to talk about it. Mrs. Johnson is more understanding of Mr. Bixby's situation, while Aunt Sadie is tolerant of Elizabeth but is also quick to point out her flaws. Julie is the only one who seems to truly see Mr. Bixby as a human being, and she is the one who ultimately helps him feel more comfortable in the situation.
