The scene opens with the clerk of the court reading the verdict of first-degree murder for the prisoner, who shows no emotion. The only sound in the courtroom is the sobbing of Ruth, who has collapsed into the arms of Mrs. Flanders. The old cattleman tells the prisoner that he will get a new trial and that he is still their friend. The prisoner is touched by a telegram from his friends and a message from Mrs. Stovall. Men begin to say that the prisoner is being punished for the crimes of others and that he did not intend to kill Joe. The financial side of the affair is troubling the officials of the county.
