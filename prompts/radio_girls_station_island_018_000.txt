The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Jessie, Amy, and Nell and to set up the conflict between Amy and Jessie. The author achieves this by having the girls disrobe and take a shower together, then have tea with Mrs. Olliver. Amy and Jessie argue over whether or not the Romans were good bathers, and Nell tries to mediate. By the end of the scene, the conflict is established and the girls are on their way back to the landing.

- The girls from Roselawn visit Mrs. Purdy Olliver, a wealthy woman from New York, at her hotel suite.
- They take tea with her and then go to the beach, where they find their boat half-filled with water.
- They row back to the landing, where they are met by the grouchy old fisherman.
- Jessie and Amy try to blame Nell for losing the rudder, but she insists it was Amy's fault.
