A crowd of miners has gathered around Hugh, who is trying to arrest Budd for shooting his brother. The sheriff says Hugh's warrant is only good in Ormsby County, but Hugh insists it is extra-territorial. The crowd is on Hugh's side, but Sloan and the Dodson brothers are gathering the camp toughs for a rescue. Suddenly, a girl appears and speaks up for Hugh, saying he is a brave man.

The purpose of this scene is to establish Hugh as a brave and honorable man, someone who is worthy of the people's trust. The author also uses the scene to establish the character of Dutch as a villain.
