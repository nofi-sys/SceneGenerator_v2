The style of this scene is highly descriptive, with long passages devoted to detailing the setting and the characters' actions and thoughts. The tone is somewhat dreamy and romantic, as the protagonist is preoccupied with his meeting with Madame d'Ionis. The point of view is third person limited, as we only know what the protagonist is thinking and feeling.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the main character. The author also establishes the conflict in this scene by introducing the character's goal (to find out what is going on in the house) and the obstacle (Madame d'Ionis' coldness).
