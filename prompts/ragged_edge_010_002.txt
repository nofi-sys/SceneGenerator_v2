A crowd of people are trying to get into a club, but the bouncer, Murphy, won't let them in. Foley, one of the people trying to get in, argues with Murphy, and the girl he's with starts to get angry. McGonagle, another man trying to get in, tells Murphy that he won't let his girls dance on the same floor as the girl Foley is with. The crowd starts to get restless and the policeman tells them to move along. Daily, one of the men in the crowd, tells Foley and McGonagle to wait and see what happens. Levi and his orchestra go in and the crowd starts to disperse. McGlory, McCarty, Shaffer, Lentze, and Koskee go in with their respective dates. The man at the door starts to collect checks from the people who are going in.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the crowd of people waiting to enter the ballroom, and by introducing some of the main characters.
