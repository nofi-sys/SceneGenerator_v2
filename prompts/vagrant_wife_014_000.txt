The tone of this scene is one of detachment and irony. The narrator is third person limited, and the point of view is Annie's. The style is direct and matter-of-fact.

The scene opens with Annie sitting by Harry's bedside as he sleeps. He wakes up and starts talking to her about a dog he bought, and Susan Green, the blacksmith's daughter. He then starts to talk about Miss West, whom he and his companions had been supping with on the night he had his accident. Annie listens to his talk about other women, feeling disgusted and longing for the company of one man - her former companion, William. When Mrs. Stanley takes her place in the sickroom, Annie escapes to the outdoors, where she wanders through the fields and copses, trying to forget that she is married. These rambles bring her both pain and pleasure, as they remind her of the long walks she used to take with William.
Harry suddenly wakes up and sees Annie sitting in the armchair by the fire. He is surprised to see her there and asks why she is nursing him. Annie tells him that she is going away as soon as he is well. Harry comments on how much she has changed and accuses her of only coming back because she could not find anyone else to admire her. Annie calmly goes back to reading her book, and the scene ends with Harry staring at her.
