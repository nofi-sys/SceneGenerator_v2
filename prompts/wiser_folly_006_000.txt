-Mrs. Trimwell: black-eyed, white-aproned woman; tells story of seeing an angel
-Corin: deep in armchair, smoking cigarette; interested in hearing Mrs. Trimwell's story
-John: laughing, approaches table; skeptical of Mrs. Trimwell's story

The purpose of this scene is to establish Mrs. Trimwell as a reliable narrator and to establish the credibility of her story. The author achieves this by having Mrs. Trimwell tell her story in a matter-of-fact way and by having the characters of Corin and John take her story seriously.

- Mrs. Trimwell, a black-eyed, white-aproned woman, enters with a covered dish.
- Corin, deep in an armchair, is smoking a cigarette and reflects aloud on what the old painter of the church down yonder thinks of their proceedings.
- John merely laughs and approaches the table. Mrs. Trimwell raises the dish-cover to reveal two golden-brown soles.
- Corin continues, saying that he has never seen a spirit but he firmly believes that one might be seen under favourable conditions.
- John and Mrs. Trimwell laugh. Mrs. Trimwell says that she once saw an angel, as plain as she sees them.
- Corin and John are both skeptical but Mrs. Trimwell insists that she is telling the truth.
- John wonders aloud why the angel would have come and Mrs. Trimwell says she doesn't know.
