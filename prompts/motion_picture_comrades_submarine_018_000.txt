The scene opens with the three main characters - Jack, Ballyhoo, and Oscar - discussing the appearance of Captain Badger on the canal locks. They are worried that he may cause trouble for them, especially if he finds out that they are staying in the lock for the night.
Captain Shooks is also on deck, and the boys notice that he seems to be holding some sort of weapon. He tells them that he is not worried about Captain Badger, and that he is prepared to defend the Argonaut if necessary.
The rest of the night passes without incident, and in the morning the boys watch as the Argonaut is released from the lock. They see the crew of the Dauntless watching them, and they remark on how afraid they seem of their captain.
Captain Shooks decides to tie up close to the lock for the rest of the day, in case they have any trouble. The boys approve of this idea, and they spend the day on deck, keeping an eye on the Dauntless.
