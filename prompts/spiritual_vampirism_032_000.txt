The style of this scene is highly satirical. The author is clearly poking fun at the character of Etherial Softdown, and her many "accomplishments." The tone is one of mockery, and the point of view is that of an outside observer.

Etherial Softdown was a former Quaker preacher who turned to elocution lectures, and later took up phrenology, mesmerism, neurology, and clairvoyance. She was known as a Swedenborgian Arcana and as the Patroness of Art. The author is poking fun at her many accomplishments and her grandiose title.
