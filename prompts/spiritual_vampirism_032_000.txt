The style of this scene is highly satirical. The author is clearly poking fun at the character of Etherial Softdown, and her many "accomplishments." The tone is one of mockery, and the point of view is that of an outside observer.

Etherial Softdown: a former Quaker preacher turned elocution lecturer, who later took up phrenology, mesmerism, neurology, and clairvoyance. She is known as a Swedenborgian Arcana and as the Patroness of Art.
Orne (Marie): Etherial's first husband, whom she left after taking up public speaking.
Quakers: a religious sect known for their simple lifestyle and plain dress.
Boanerges Phospher: a celebrated preacher of Universalism.
Andrew Jackson Davis: a seer known for his work in Swedenborgian Arcana.
Gabriel: the angel said to have appeared to Etherial in a vision.
Pork, Tobacco, Wine: three vices that Etherial Softdown warns against in her lectures.
Grahamism: a system of diet and exercise advocated by Sylvester Graham in the 19th century.
Bran-bread: a type of bread made with bran, advocated by Graham as part of his healthy diet.

This scene is a partial schedule of the terms of a terrible
confederacy, as furnished in a detached note by Yieger. He
regarded this particular organisation as the most formidable of
all, and traced many of its ramifications, in their covert
results, with a singularly dogged tenacity.
First, we have here a note concerning Etherial Softdown. This
woman, whose patronymic was Softdown, first married a Quaker,
named Orne; which name, after her separation, and until after her
divorce, she continued to bear, with the _alias_ of Marie. She
began her public career, soon after her marriage, as a Quaker
preacher; but the straitness of this sect not conforming at all to
her latitudinarian principles, she recanted in disgust, and left
the society.
She now plunged at once into Physiology, and, after a
miraculously short gestation, produced a few lectures, with which she
went the rounds of two or three New England States, accompanied by her
husband, whom she, _sans ceremonie_, dubbed M. D., without putting him
to the trouble of reading, or ever having read, a book on any subject.
Finding this to be poor business on the whole, she deserted him,
taking her child with her. The next occupation in which we find her
versatile genius engaged, was that of teaching French; a more humble
employment, surely, but one for which she was equally well fitted.
Having now fairly assayed her wings for flight, she soared aloft at
once, in full career, through mid-air. She became first a preacher
of Universalism; but meeting, about this time, with the celebrated
Boanerges Phospher, she, in a few weeks, turned out full-plumed,
as a lecturer on Elocution.
Then, as a natural consequence, came Mesmerism; then Neurology. Of
all these sciences she became the prompt expounder, after a few days
investigation.
From this point she immediately ascended a step higher, and announced
herself as a revelator in Clairvoyance; and, by an inevitable
progression, she at once found admission, along with Andrew Jackson
Davis and a host of other seers, into the Swedenborgian Arcana.
The exposition of Grahamism and Bran-bread was now added to the
enlarged circle of her enlightened Professorships; and, by this
aid, and that of her spiritual commission, she wrought wonders, in
assailing the camps of the great foes of humanityPork, Tobacco, and
Wine!
