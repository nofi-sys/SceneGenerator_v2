The style of this scene is very dramatic. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is one of suspense and fear.

Moses Samuels, a Jew, is talking to Julian, a Quaker. He tells Julian that the new commander of the Kash Guard, Or-tis, has ordered five hides from him to be tanned the finest. Moses says that Or-tis is as bad as that, and heaven help us.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of the protagonist, Julian, and to provide background information on the setting and the conflict. The author achieves these goals by having Julian recount a recent traumatic event in his life - the massacre of his family by the Kalkars. This event serves to establish Julian as a sympathetic character, and also provides information on the Kalkars, who are the antagonists in the story.
