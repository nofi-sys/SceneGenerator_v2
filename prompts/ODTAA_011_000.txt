The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The dialogue is polite but stiff, and the characters seem to be very proper and well-mannered. There is a sense of tension and suspense throughout the scene, as the characters wait to find out what the proclamation is all about.

Don Inocencio, a senator of the White party, visits Rosa and her mother to tell them about a recent proclamation by the government. He is excited about the document, which he believes will be a landmark in history, and proceeds to read it aloud.
The proclamation is a call for all citizens to be quiet and orderly during Lent. Don Inocencio is pleased with the document, but Rosa and her mother are not very impressed.
