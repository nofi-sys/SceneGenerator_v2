The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the conspiracy against Sagroth, and to establish the character of Ju-lan as a curious and inquisitive person.

The scene takes place in the city of Laythe, on the moon. Ju-lan, the protagonist, is talking to two men who are loyal to Ko-tah, the leader of a coup d'etat against the current ruler, Sagroth. Ju-lan has just learned that the coup has been in the works for ten years, and is not surprised to hear that it may take another ten years to come to fruition.
As Ju-lan is leaving Ko-tah's palace, he sees a man who he believes to be an enemy of Laythe. Ju-lan follows the man into a room, only to find Ko-tah and three other men, two of whom are Kalkars (enemies of Laythe). Ko-tah explains that the three men are prisoners, and Ju-lan backs out of the room.
Ju-lan later talks to Moh-goh, a friend, about what he saw. Moh-goh tells Ju-lan to forget about it, and Ju-lan agrees.
