-The Wolf: armed with a light lance, knife, and sword; short and stout; bow and quiver of arrows slung beneath his right stirrup leather; metal blades from Kolrado
-The Kolrados: bring news and metal from a far place; travel many days to reach the Wolf's clan; pass through many lands unmolested; once in two years
-The Utaws: bring metal; inferior to Kolrado metal; only used for horse shoes
-The people of the world: used to travel freely and speak the same language; now divided by the Kalkars
-The Kalkars: brought hatred and suspicion among the people of the world; the Wolf's clan's never-ending crusade is to drive the last of them into the sea
-The Red Hawk: 20 years old; fierce chiefs of 100 clans bow to his will; 20th Julian; can trace his line back 534 years; learned to hate the Kalkars and the tribe of Or-tis; schooled in riding and the deeds of his forebears
-The Rock: raised his spear and shook it savagely toward the valley; scalp-lock fastened just below its metal-shod tip trembled in the wind
-The Rattlesnake: cried that the green of the groves will be dyed red with the Kalkars' blood
-The Coyote: laughed as the Wolf clan rode downward out of the hills toward the desert
