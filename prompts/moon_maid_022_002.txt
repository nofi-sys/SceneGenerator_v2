The author achieves these goals by having the protagonist talk about his feelings for the girl and by having him describe the enemy that they will be up against.

The protagonist is out walking with Jim, Mollie, and Juana when he runs into Peter Johansen. He knows that Johansen is up to something, so he confront him. Johansen then attacks him with a knife, but the protagonist is able to disarm and injure him. He goes home and tells his mother what happened.
