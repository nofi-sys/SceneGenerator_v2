The purpose of this scene is to create suspense and tension as the protagonist, Rob, attempts to escape from prison. The author achieves this by describing the escape in detail and then introducing the possibility that Rob may be caught.

1. Rob: A prisoner who has escaped from his cell and is hiding in a cart of hay.
2. Muckle John: A man who helped Rob escape and was supposed to meet him.
3. The sentry: A guard who is patrolling the fort.
4. Strange: A man who is in charge of the fort.

- Rob is in his cell, scraping at the bars of the window to try and file through them
- He finally succeeds in cutting through one bar and starts to work on the cross-bar
- It takes him a long time, but he eventually cuts through that too
- He then ties one end of his rope to the bar and lowers himself down the wall
- He reaches the ground and starts to look for the cart of hay that Muckle John said would be there
- He finds it and climbs in, just as the dawn is starting to break
- Suddenly, there is a commotion as someone sees the rope dangling from the wall and raises the alarm
- Rob hears the sentry running towards his cell and the bugle sounding the call to arms
- He wonders if Muckle John has failed him, but then hears him shouting from the window that he's found the escapee
- The excitement in the courtyard grows and Rob hears muskets firing from the walls, but no one comes near the cart
- It's all very baffling and mysterious.
