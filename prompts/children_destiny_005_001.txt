The tone of this scene is light and humorous, with a bit of an edge to it. The POV is third person omniscient.

In the scene, Mr. Shapleigh is discussing with his wife and daughter the possibility of inviting Richard Skelton to dinner. Mrs. Shapleigh is against the idea, as she has heard that Mr. Skelton does not believe in hell, and she is worried about what the bishop will say if he finds out. Mr. Shapleigh eventually agrees to invite Mr. Skelton, and old Tom is sent to Deerchase to extend the invitation.
When old Tom arrives, he is met by Mr. Skelton in the library. The two men chat for a while about Sylvia, and Mr. Shapleigh expresses his hope that Mr. Skelton will do something great with his life. Mr. Skelton is noncommittal, but old Tom is sure that he has the potential for greatness.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Richard Skelton and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. We learn that Skelton is a brilliant but misunderstood man who is not afraid to challenge authority. We also learn that he is married to a woman who does not believe in hell, which will be a point of contention later in the story.
