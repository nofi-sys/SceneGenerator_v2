George visits his sick father at the Grange, where he learns that Sir George has forgiven Harry and wants George to provide for him. George promises to do so, and Sir George then dies.

The purpose of this scene is to show the death of Sir George and the reaction of his family.

The literary style of this scene is very formal and old-fashioned. The dialogue is stiff and formal, and the characters speak in a very polite, deferential way. There is a sense of foreboding and tragedy throughout the scene, and the atmosphere is very somber.
