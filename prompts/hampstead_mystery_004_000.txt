The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Mr and Mrs Hindes, and to set up the conflict between them regarding their daughter Jenny's relationship with Mr Walcheren.

Mr and Mrs Hindes are discussing Mr Walcheren, a man who has been paying attention to their daughter, Jenny. Mrs Hindes is concerned that Jenny may have developed feelings for him, but Mr Hindes is sure that Jenny is only interested in his money. They are interrupted by the arrival of Mr Crampton, who is out of breath and clearly upset about something.

The literary style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The tone is polite but cool, and the point of view is third person limited.
