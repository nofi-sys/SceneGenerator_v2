The literary style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The dialogue is stiff and the characters seem to be speaking in a very proper, polite manner. There is a sense of distance between the characters and the reader.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Mrs. Lucien and to establish her as a mystery woman with a possible hidden past. The author achieves this by having the characters discuss Mrs. Lucien's background and speculate on her true identity.
