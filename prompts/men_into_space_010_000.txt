-McCauley: a man who is feeling weak and stupid, though he can't figure out why. He's the one who notices the radiation coming through the screen and tells Bramwell.
-Randy: McCauley's partner. He's also feeling listless and not himself.
-Mr. Perkins: the ship's canary. He's not singing well today.
-Bramwell: the man who designed the Bramwell-Faraday screen. He's irritable and doesn't want to be disturbed.

- McCauley and Randy are two weeks into their journey to Venus
- They have a Bramwell-Faraday screen that is supposed to keep out radiation, but it's not working
- McCauley goes to talk to Bramwell about it, and Bramwell is angry and yells at him
- McCauley adjusts the screen and the radiation count goes down

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of unease and foreboding.
