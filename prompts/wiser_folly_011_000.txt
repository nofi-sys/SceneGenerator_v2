Corin and John are discussing John's recent trip to America, during which he met a family with whom he has become close. Corin argues that John is being too sympathetic to the family's problems, and that he has no right to take them to heart since he is not actually part of the family. John disagrees, and insists that his sympathy is just a normal human reaction.

The literary style of this scene is lighthearted and sarcastic. The tone is one of teasing and good-natured banter. The point of view is third person limited, with the focus on Corin's thoughts and feelings.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between John and Corin's different perspectives. John is sympathetic to the family's plight, while Corin is more rational and detached. This conflict will drive the rest of the story.
