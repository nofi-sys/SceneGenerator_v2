The tone of this scene is one of jealousy and frustration, mixed with a touch of humor. The point of view is from Elizabeth's perspective, and we see Blair through her eyes. The style is fairly straightforward and simple, with some dialogue interspersed throughout.

Blair and Elizabeth have been married for 15 years and live on a farm. Blair is obsessed with a black horse named Alabaster that belongs to their neighbor, Tom Shapleigh. Blair is convinced that Alabaster is a better horse than any of the thoroughbreds in the stable of their rival, Richard Skelton.
 Elizabeth tries to dissuade Blair from fixating on the horse, reminding him that they can't afford to buy it and that Mr. Shapleigh has no intention of selling it. Blair is undeterred, however, and tells Elizabeth that he is determined to own the horse. He is so obsessed with it that he has been dreaming about it at night.
Blair goes to talk to Mr. Shapleigh, who is initially resistant to selling the horse. However, Blair is able to convince him to sell Alabaster by offering to pay off all of the mortgages on the Shapleigh farm.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Blair and Elizabeth over the horse Alabaster. Blair is obsessed with the horse and Elizabeth is jealous of the attention he is giving it.
