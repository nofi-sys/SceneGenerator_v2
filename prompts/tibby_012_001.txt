The literary style of this scene is formal and objective. The narrator is third-person omniscient, and the tone is dispassionate.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Mr. and Mrs. Wylie. The author achieves this by showing how their disagreement over Mr. Wylie's involvement in spiritism has led to a rift in their relationship.

Mrs. Wylie is disappointed in her husband's growing interest in the creed of Dr. Lyman, and she spends less time with him as a result. She becomes more involved in society and more extravagant, while her husband withdraws into his books and papers.
