The purpose of this scene is to reveal that the Dodsons' title to the Bald Knob mine is invalid. The author achieves this goal by having the character Ralph Dodson cross-examined about the details of his purchase from Singlefoot Bill, which reveals that Bill was actually named Willis Thornton and had died before the sale.

The scene opens with the jury in the Bald Knob mine case deliberating. The evidence against the Dodsons is circumstantial, but the jury is ready to convict them when the opposing lawyer, Browning, produces evidence that the man they claim to have bought the mine from, Singlefoot Bill, was actually named Willis Thornton and had died six weeks before the date on the contract. Ralph Dodson, the last witness for the plaintiffs, is stunned. He had been sure of the date and had even obtained a specimen of Singlefoot Bill's signature, but he had never guessed there was another Thornton. Browning continues to produce evidence that Singlefoot Bill had admitted, before several witnesses, that he was not going to patent any of his prospects, and Ralph Dodson's face grows increasingly pale. In the end, the Dodsons are convicted and Browning triumphantly declares that justice has been served.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its tense, dramatic atmosphere. The dialogue is sharp and the characters' emotions are high. The point of view is third person limited, and the focus is on Ralph Dodson's inner thoughts and feelings.
