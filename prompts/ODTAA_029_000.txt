The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a sense of foreboding. The point of view is from Hi's perspective, and the tone is one of fear and anxiety.

The scene opens with Hi and the American discussing the firing they can hear in the distance. The American explains that it is an attack, but that it seems to be winding down. Suddenly, however, the firing picks up again, this time much closer. The two men take cover as bullets begin to ricochet off the nearby roofs. Hi is worried about Carlotta, but the American assures him that the Whites must be winning if they are entering the town.
The firing continues for some time, eventually dying down as night falls. Hi and the American can hear the sound of horses and shouting as the Whites enter the town. Soon after, they hear the sound of executions taking place nearby. Hi is horrified, but the American is nonchalant, explaining that this is standard procedure in their Republic.

The purpose of this scene is to show the brutality of war and the consequences of losing. The author achieves this by describing the executions of prisoners in graphic detail.
