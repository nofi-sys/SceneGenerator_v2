The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Ruth and Mr. Jennings, and to set up the conflict between them. Ruth is determined to make her ranch a success, and Mr. Jennings is skeptical that she will be able to do it.

Ruth is preparing to go ahead with a project on the ranch, and she assumes that the foreman is as enthusiastic as she is. However, he is not very optimistic about her chances of success. Ruth is more interested in her baby than the ranch, and she is determined to raise him scientifically. She takes him with her when she drives around the property on business. In her letters to Rowan, she always mentions the baby first and shows him that the boy is just as much his son as hers.
