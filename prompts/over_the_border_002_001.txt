1. On a Sunday morning, the crew of an American ship is preparing for their weekly chores.
2. One of the crew, Devlin, wants a haircut and shave.
3. The other crew members refuse, so Andrus volunteers.
4. Andrus cuts Devlin's hair and shaves him clumsily but quickly.
5. Devlin suddenly starts barking and growling like a dog.
6. The mates and skipper try to get Devlin to stop, but he only grows more violent.
7. Devlin is put in his berth and voted crazy.
8. A few days later, Andrus is lost overboard in a squall.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Devlin and to foreshadow the events to come. Devlin is established as a hot-headed, rebellious Irishman who is not afraid to speak his mind. He is also shown to be somewhat of a ne'er-do-well. The author achieves these goals by having Devlin argue with the other sailors and then volunteer to give them haircuts and shaves. This establishes his character as someone who is not afraid of a challenge and who is willing to take on tasks that others do not want to do. The author also foreshadows the events to come by having Devlin growl and bark like a dog after his haircut and shave. This foreshadows the fact that Devlin will later go crazy and start barking like a dog.
