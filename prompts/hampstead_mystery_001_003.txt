- Jenny Crampton: A fast girl of the nineteenth century. She is beautiful and vain, and has a sharp tongue.
- Mrs Crampton: Jenny's mother. She is anxious and timid, and deeply loves her daughter.
- Miss Bostock: Jenny's aunt. She is meek and unoffending.

Jenny is driving in her Ralli cart and is rude and impertinent to her parents and aunt. The pedestrians say she is the beautiful Miss Crampton and she is pleased. Frederick Walcheren is infatuated with her and believes her to be good and lovable.

The style of this scene is very harsh and critical. Jenny is portrayed as a selfish and spoiled young woman, and her mother and aunt are shown to be meek and submissive. There is a sense of foreboding throughout the scene, as Jenny's mother is worried about her daughter's safety.
