The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two main characters, Helen and Mrs. Durand. The author also establishes the conflict between the two characters: Mrs. Durand believes that Helen is in love with Gilbert Lisle, while her husband believes that Helen is in love with Quentin.

The tone of this scene is one of suspense and mystery, as the reader is left guessing about the nature of Helen's "trouble" and who she might be in love with. The point of view is third person limited, as we only know what the characters are thinking and feeling, and not what is going on in the wider world. The style is fairly straightforward, with some dialogue interspersed with the narrator's thoughts and observations.

Mrs. Durand is walking home with her husband after a dinner party, during which they had discussed the recent engagement of Gilbert Lisle and Helen Home. Mrs. Durand confides in her husband that she believes Helen is secretly in love with Lisle, based on her observations of the girl's behavior during the party. Her husband is skeptical, but Mrs. Durand is adamant in her belief.
They discuss the possibility that Lisle may have saved Helen's life on two occasions - once when she was drowning, and once when she was stranded on the mainland - and Mrs. Durand posits that these events may have created a bond between the two. They also recall a conversation from the night of the ball in which Lisle had said what a nice girl Helen was.
Mrs. Durand is convinced that Helen is in love with Lisle, but her husband remains skeptical.
