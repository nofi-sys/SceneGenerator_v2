The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Rob Fraser and to provide background information on the events leading up to his escape from prison. The author achieves this by having Strange taunt Rob about his impending execution and informing him that he will be known as a traitor. This causes Rob to despair and he contemplates suicide. However, the arrival of Muckle John outside his cell gives him hope and he begins to plan his escape.

Rob Fraser is a Jacobite prisoner who has been tortured for information. When his captor, Strange, returns, he tells Rob that he will be let go if he betrays the location of Lovat. Rob agrees, and is given a week. He uses the time to file through his chains and bars, and escape. At cock-crow, he meets Muckle John, who takes him to safety.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of foreboding. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Rob's perspective. The tone is one of despair, with a touch of hope.
