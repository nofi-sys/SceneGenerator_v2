The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict that David is feeling between his desire for the gold and his desire for the unknown thing that he sees before him. The author achieves this by having David explain his dilemma to Elizabeth in a series of symbols.

Elizabeth: Elizabeth is a patient and understanding listener. She is also amused by David's innocence.
David: David is a man on a mission. He is confident and single-minded in his pursuit. However, he is also somewhat naive.

In this scene, David is trying to explain to Elizabeth why he is embarking on a new quest, even though he has already achieved his original goal. He compares it to a man finding a sack of gold, but then seeing something else that he wants and knowing that he has to go for it.
