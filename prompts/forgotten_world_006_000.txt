The style of this scene is rather dry and matter-of-fact. There is a sense of tension between the characters, but it is not overtly expressed. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Carlin's perspective.

-Harb Land: older brother, hostile, gangly
-Gramp Land: proud, old man, Gramp is short for Grandfather
-Jonny Land: younger brother, quiet, thin-faced, a Cosmic Engineer graduate from Canopus University
