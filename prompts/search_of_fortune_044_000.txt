The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the conflict. The author achieves this by describing the landscape and the weather, and by introducing the character of the collie dog.

- It was the last month of winter and a gay party from Burley New Farm set out to visit Findlayson. 
- They camped out in the Bush and the evening was spent in much the same way as the night before, with singing and story-telling around the fire. 
- In the morning, they were greeted with a thorough old-fashioned hoar frost. 
- The young men ran merrily away to the pool in the creek, and most effectually scared the ducks. 
- The breakfast was a different sort of a meal to the morsel of stiff damper and corned junk that had been partaken of at last bivouac. 
- Craig and Archie, riding on in front, came upon the well-known bobtailed collie, who was the almost constant companion of the squatter. 
- The dog was alive, but dying. There was a terrible spear-gash in his neck. 
- Craig dismounted and knelt beside him. The poor brute knew him, wagged his inch-long tail, licked the hand that caressed him, and almost immediately expired. 
- Craig immediately rode back to the others and said, "Do not be alarmed, ladies. But I fear the worst. There is no smoke in Findlayson's chimney. The black fellows have killed his dog." 
- The men consulted hurriedly, and it was agreed that while Branson and Harry waited with the ladies, Archie and Craig should ride on towards the house. 
- They found several dead natives, festering and sweltering in the noonday sun, as well as the boomerangs and spears that had fallen from their hands as they dropped. 
- Inside the house, they found the bodies of Hurricane Bill and poor Findlayson, hacked about almost beyond recognition.
