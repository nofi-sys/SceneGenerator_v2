The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is from Dud's perspective, and the tone is one of anger and frustration.

Duds: a small boy who was just trying to get his towel from his locker when he was confronted by the much larger Star. He seems to be a bit of a hothead, based on his reaction to being called an insect.
Star: a large, bullying boy who was apparently picking on Duds for talking around school. He is quick to anger and doesn't seem to care about anyone but himself.
Davy: the Welsh janitor who breaks up the fight between Duds and Star. He seems to be a fair man, trying to keep the peace in the locker room.
Jimmy: a friend of Duds who was apparently watching the whole thing. He seems to be excited by the prospect of a fight and is disappointed when it doesn't happen.
