The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and characters for the story, as well as to establish the conflict. The author achieves this by introducing the two main characters and their respective weapons, as well as by establishing the rules of their duel.

-Aurora: A woman who is the subject of Melusine's thoughts. She is sleeping at the beginning of the scene.
-Melusine: The narrator and protagonist of the scene. She is tired and contemplates telling Aurora everything.
-Hagen: A man who arrives later in the scene. He is a skilled swordsman and has come prepared with a statement and an alarm clock.

Two adversaries, Hagen and the Professor, are about to duel. Hagen has set an alarm clock to go off ten minutes after six, at which point they will fire their pistols at each other. The Professor reflects on the absurdity of the situation, but goes along with it.
