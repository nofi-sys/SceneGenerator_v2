Kelsey: a man who is trying to be accepted by a group
Alice: a woman who is trying to understand Kelsey's love
Gloria: a woman who Kelsey loves
The woman on the TV: a woman who is trying to sell a product

The purpose of this scene is to show the contrast between the life of Kelsey and his love, Gloria, and the life of Alice, a domestic robot. Kelsey and Gloria are happy and in love, while Alice feels only fear and hunger. The scene also highlights the difference between humans and robots, as Alice is not able to experience love or feel any connection to the people around her.

Kelsey and his girlfriend Gloria are sitting on the couch watching TV when an ad for a Sky-Splitter jet sporter comes on. Kelsey is immediately interested, but Gloria reminds him that they can't afford it. Kelsey says they could get a roommate permit, but Gloria doesn't want to rush things.
 Alice, who is Kelsey's domestic robot, is watching them from the kitchen. She feels a growing desire to be with Kelsey and to feel him holding her, never to let him leave or be taken from her. However, she knows it can never happen because she is not human.
