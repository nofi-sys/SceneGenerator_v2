The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a sense of foreboding. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Hi's perspective. The tone is one of fear and dread, as Hi anticipates the arrival of the Reds.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal that the Reds have won the revolution and are now in control of the city. This is a significant plot point because it changes the power dynamic between the protagonist (Hi) and the antagonist (Don Manuel). Up until this point, Hi has been a prisoner of the Whites and at the mercy of Don Manuel. However, with the Reds in control, Hi now has a chance to escape and potentially get revenge on his captor.

A group of English-speaking people are detained in a church by a group of armed guards. The leader of the guards is a prim-lipped man who is waiting for someone. The detainees are eventually joined by the commandant, who is a big, flashy cavalryman, and a woman who is also wearing a scarlet sash. The American detainee whispers to Hi that the woman is the were-wolf and that there will be blood.
