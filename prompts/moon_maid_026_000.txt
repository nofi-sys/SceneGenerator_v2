The scene takes place near a prison camp for American prisoners of war during the Kalkar occupation. The protagonist, Julian 8th, has just arrived and is hiding outside the stockade, trying to attract the attention of one of the sentries.
After a brief conversation, Julian 8th learns that his father is also a prisoner at the camp. They discuss Julian's plan to escape and his father tells him that some of the other prisoners may be willing to help, but that many are too weak and demoralized to even try.
As they continue to talk, the sentry grows more and more restless and eventually walks away. Julian 8th and his father take this opportunity to discuss the details of the escape plan. Julian's father agrees to help, but warns him that the chances of success are slim.
The scene ends with the two men parting ways, each planning to do their part to make the escape attempt a success.
