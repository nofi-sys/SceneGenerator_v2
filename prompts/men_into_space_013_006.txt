McCauley is the leader of a team of astronauts who are exploring the asteroid Eros. One of the team members, Fallon, becomes agitated when McCauley tries to fix his knot. Fallon believes that McCauley is trying to kill him, so he unties his rope and floats away from the asteroid.
The other team members quickly realize what has happened and work together to rescue Fallon. One of them finally manages to snag Fallon's rope with his own, and they haul him back to safety.
Later, McCauley explains to the team what happened. Fallon is embarrassed and ashamed, but the others forgive him.
