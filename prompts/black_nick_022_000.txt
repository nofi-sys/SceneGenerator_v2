Alphonse de Cavannes, count in France, baron in Germany, and even duke of a small Italian province, was, at thirty, an object of envy to half of Europe, for his riches and social position. Descended from a family which united the best bloods of three kingdoms, he inherited vast estates in all, greatest of all in France. Such was the frank generosity of his nature, that his parasites were numerous, but to none of them had he shown so much kindness as to a young English officer, a scion of the noble house of Oxford, Pierce Harley by name. This youth had been taken prisoner by the count in the famous battle of Fontenoy, thirty-two years before the date of our tale, and his captor, instead of leaving him, as he well might have done, to the fate of an officer on parole, on scanty pay, had taken him into his own house in Paris, and treated him with the kindness of a brother. He had been induced to this course chiefly from the finding that Harley was a distant relation of the young Countess de Cavannes, who was, by birth, English, and whom her husband positively adored. Young Harley, then a handsome, athletic young fellow, had professed himself extremely grateful for this kindness. Being a younger son, without fortune, the friendship of the great French lord was of much value to him. When peace was concluded, moreover, instead of allowing Harley to go back to England, the generous count insisted on his resigning his commission, and remaining in France as steward of all De Cavannes estates, everywhere treated as the trusted friend of their owner. Harley accepted it, and for twelve years occupied the post, doing exactly as he pleased.
The Count de Cavannes is a wealthy French nobleman who, thirty years prior to the events of the story, took in a young English prisoner of war, Pierce Harley, and treated him with great kindness. Harley eventually became the steward of all the Count's estates in France, and the two men became close friends. Twelve years before the story begins, the Count met up with an old friend, Adrian Schuyler, who convinced him to buy an estate in America. The Count, his daughter Diana, and Harley all move to America and settle in Vermont.
At the beginning of the story, the Count, Schuyler, Diana, and Harley are all gathered around a table in the Count's Vermont home, enjoying a meal together. The Count tells them that he is going to finally redeem a promise he made long ago to tell his children the story of his life. He proceeds to tell them the story of his life, which we shall epitomize as briefly as possible.
