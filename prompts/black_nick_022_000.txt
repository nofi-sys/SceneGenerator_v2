Count de Cavannes is a wealthy French nobleman who, thirty years prior to the events of the story, took in a young English prisoner of war, Pierce Harley, and treated him with great kindness. Harley eventually became the steward of all the Count's estates in France, and the two men became close friends. Twelve years before the story begins, the Count met up with an old friend, Adrian Schuyler, who convinced him to buy an estate in America. The Count, his daughter Diana, and Harley all move to America and settle in Vermont.
