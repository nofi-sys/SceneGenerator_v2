- McCauley arrives at Grimaldi Base, furious that Kent and Holmes have not yet been transferred out.
- He is informed that they are setting up a relay on Farside and may be checking in with base.
- McCauley snaps that they are in more trouble than they know, as they have lost two air tanks.
- He takes over the relay himself, in hopes of intercepting any messages from the two men.

The tone of this scene is tense and suspenseful, as the reader is left wondering whether or not the two men will actually kill each other. The point of view is third person limited, as we only know what McCauley is thinking and feeling.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two main characters, Holmes and Kent. The author achieves this by showing the reader the history of the men's enmity and how it has played out in their previous encounters.
