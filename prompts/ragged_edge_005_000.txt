The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by introducing the characters through their dialogue.

1. In the wake-house of Paddy Murphy, groups of children sit upon cellar doors and slatternly women stand on doorsteps, morbidly watching all who come and go.
2. Mrs. Nolan, her head muffled in a woollen shawl, is leaning out at her kitchen window, when Hogan the policeman comes through the court.
3. Hogan asks Mrs. Nolan if she is going in to the wake, and she tells him that her family will go tomorrow night.
4. Hogan tells Mrs. Nolan that a Solemn High Mass will be held for Paddy Murphy.
5. Mrs. Nolan says that there will be a lot of hacks at the funeral, and that her family will go in style in one of O'Connor's hacks.
6. As Mrs. Nolan is speaking, she sees a drunken young man, Martin Kelly, stagger up the steps of Murphy's house.
7. Goose McGonagle, who is with Kelly, tries to dissuade him from going into the wake-house, but Kelly is determined to go in and "lick Larry Murphy."
8. Hogan grabs Kelly and tells him he's under arrest.
9. Kelly is hustled down the street just as Mary Carroll opens the door to the wake-house.
10. McGonagle tells Mary that Kelly was just causing a disturbance and she says that he was there earlier and said shameful things.
11. McGonagle enters the wake-house, where a black box rests upon a pair of low trestles and a number of wax lights burn at its head.
