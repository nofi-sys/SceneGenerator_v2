The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator. However, there is a touch of romance and legend-building in the way that the events are described. This is seen in the way that Scot's actions are described as "heroic" and how Hugh is described as an "instrument of justice."

- Scot McClintock: the Ormsby House hotel proprietor and patron, known for his gift of the heroic touch
- Hugh McClintock: Colonel McClintock's son, who killed Dutch in a duel
- Father Marston: a prophet who predicted Dutch's death
- Jim Budd: the new sheriff of Piodie county
- Byers: an associate of the McClintocks
- Vicky Lowell: a claim-holder and popular, lone, defenceless girl in Piodie

The scene is set in Piodie, Nevada, where a new gold strike has just been made. Hugh McClintock, one of the owners of the claims, arrives to find that everyone is excited about the strike. Sheriff Jim Budd tells Hugh that his claims are in danger of being jumped, but that the claim owned by Miss Lowell is safe because she is a popular, lone, defenceless girl.
