In the room of a farm-house in the American lines near Saratoga, a
large gathering of officers was assembled, including British, Hessian, and American officers. A carriage rolled
up to the door of the farm-house, attended by a single dragoon, and a
lady with two little children was helped out by one of the American
officers. This same officer took up the frightened little ones in his arms, kissed them affectionately,
and turned to welcome the mother.
The lady was the Baroness Reidesel, wife of the Hessian commander, and
the officer was General Schuyler. Schuyler took the Baroness and her children to his tent, where he introduced her to his betrothed wife, Mademoiselle Diane de Cavannes, and his cousin, Captain Adrian Schuyler.
The conversation was carried on in English, German,
and French, and the Baroness soon felt at ease. However, an incident occurred which
showed that war was not at rest entirely. There was a disturbance heard outside, and Adrian Schuyler went
out to see what was the matter. It turned out that Burgoyne and his principal officers had been dining with
Gates and his staff, and that all were somewhat the worse for wine.

The style of this scene is formal and polite. The tone is one of cordiality and respect, and the point of view is third person omniscient.
