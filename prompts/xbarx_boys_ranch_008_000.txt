Teddy Manley is rolling and tumbling down an incline when he is suddenly stopped by a tree. He hangs on the edge of a cliff for a moment before falling unconscious. When he wakes up, he has a headache and is confused. He does not know how he got to where he is. He stands up and looks around. He is in a rocky cubicle with a drop off of two or three hundred feet. He has no recollection of how he got there. His clothes are torn and he has cuts on his hands. He is thirsty. He tries to remember what happened before he fell. He and his friend Roy were looking for a spring to quench their thirst. They must have become separated. Teddy falls asleep and has a dream in which he is back at the spring with Roy. In the dream, he tells Roy about the red lightning he saw. He wakes up and realizes that the red lightning was real. He looks up and sees the sun setting. He is determined to find a way out before it gets dark.
