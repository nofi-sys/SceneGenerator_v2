The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Annie and Aubrey, and to hint at Aubrey's feelings for Annie.
The author achieves this by having Aubrey take Annie to see the sights of each town they visit, and by having them share intimate conversations. The author also hints at Aubrey's feelings for Annie by having him notice even the smallest details about her, and by having him feel nervous about proposing to her.

-Aubrey Cooke: well-educated and witty, with a charm that the Braithwaites were one and all sadly deficient in.
-Annie Langton: capricious and high-spirited, with a charm that made all other women seem insipid in Aubrey's eyes.
-Mrs. Briggs: an old, frightened, and apologetic woman.
-William: a delightful companion with the same high spirits as Aubrey.
-Colonel Richardson: a handsome Lovelace that Miss Langton takes an interest in.

Aubrey Cooke and Annie Langton are sitting by the fire in Mrs. Briggs' kitchen, chatting amicably. Mrs. Briggs comes in and is surprised to see them home before her. Aubrey scolds her for being away from the house for four hours. Annie runs away laughing to her sitting room. Aubrey goes upstairs, singing. They are now good friends.
