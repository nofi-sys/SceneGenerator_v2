A man has just arrived in Holland and is staying at a hotel. He is a fugitive from Dartmoor prison and is aware that the police are likely to be looking for him. He is also aware that he has very little time to accomplish his goals.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of mystery and danger. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is tense and foreboding.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the main character. The author achieves this by describing the city and the hotel, and by introducing Fay as a British traveler.
