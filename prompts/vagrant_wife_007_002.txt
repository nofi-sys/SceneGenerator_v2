In the scene, Annie is playing the piano for Colonel Richardson and Lilian is trying to get his attention. George joins Annie in the conservatory and tells her that she played beautifully. Annie is surprised that George would notice and says that he must be more civilized than she thought. George tells her that even among the "semi-civilized" there are people with potential for more.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Annie and George, and to set up the conflict between them. Annie is a passionate musician who feels stifled by her life in the country, while George is a boorish man who is uninterested in music. This conflict will drive the rest of the story.

-Annie: A matronly woman who is pleased when Colonel Richardson recognizes her music. She is simple and child-like.
-Lilian: A woman who is jealous of Annie's attention from the Colonel. She is dangerous and piquant.
-George: A man who is patient with Annie. He is quiet and understands music.
