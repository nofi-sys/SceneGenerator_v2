The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the main character. The author achieves this by describing the character's reaction to the news that he will have to spend a year on Earth.

- Carlin is a space traveler who is suffering from star-sickness, a condition where the mind can't take the strain of star-travel
- He is being forced to go to Earth, the planet of his ancestors, to rest and recuperate
- Carlin is resentful and angry at the thought of spending any amount of time on the "old relic"
- As the space ship carrying him nears Earth, the other passengers are excited and eager to see the planet
- Carlin himself is unimpressed by the small, yellow sun and the tiny planets orbiting it
- He is relieved when the space ship finally lands on Earth, even though he knows he will have to spend some time there

The style of this scene is rather formal and clinical. The narrator is third person omniscient, and the tone is detached and objective.
