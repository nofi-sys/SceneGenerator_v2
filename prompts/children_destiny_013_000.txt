The purpose of this scene is to show the aftermath of the horse race, in which Hilary's horse, Alabaster, is injured and Blair kicks the horse in anger. The goals the author achieves are to show the Blair's reaction to the events, as well as the reactions of those around them.

The literary style of this scene is one of tragedy and suspense. The tone is tense and dramatic, and the point of view is from that of an omniscient narrator.

- Before waiting to hear more about Hilary, Blair ran up to the struggling horse and stamped his foot violently in its quivering flank. 
- The horse, half dead, sank back and Blair, struck with shame and horror, knelt down and took the horse's head in his arms. 
- Mrs. Blair, sat bolt upright in her saddle, until Blair kicked the dying horse; then, without a word or a cry, she fell over. 
- Skelton caught her and laid her down upon the grass. Sylvia Shapleigh, jumping out of the carriage, ran to her. 
- Mrs. Blair, although more than half conscious by that time, yet could not take it all in and she seemed to be lingering on the borders of a dim world of peace and sweet forgetfulness. 
- All at once everything returned to her with a rush. She saw Hilary go down. She saw Blair's furious and insane action. 
- Mrs. Blair, as if inspired by a new spirit, sat up and, disdaining Skeltons arm, rose to her feet. 
- Just then Blair came up. In ten minutes he had aged ten years. He had had a crazy moment or two, but now he was deadly calm and pale. 
- The boy is all right, he said. As a matter of fact, Hilary was far from all right, but Blair did not intend to tell Mrs. Blair then. 
- Mrs. Blair declined the carriage rather stiffly and, gathering up the reins in her trembling hands, rode off the field with her husband. 
- People gave them all the room they wanted, for they were encompassed with the dignity of misfortune. They took a private road through the woods that led to the Newington lane. 
- Mrs. Blair did not know whether Alabaster were dead or alive and she asked Blair presently. 
- Shot, replied Blair briefly.
