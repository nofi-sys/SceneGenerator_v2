The purpose of this scene is to establish the background and context for the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. The author establishes the stakes (the potential for disaster if the Earthmen succeed in their plan) and introduces the main characters and their motivations.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person omniscient.

The scene opens with Carlin having doubts about the Sun-mining plan that he has agreed to help Earthmen with. He remembers the disastrous consequences of previous attempts at Sun-mining, and is worried that the Earthmen will not be able to control the process. However, he goes out to the workshop with Jonny and Harb to see the machine they have built. Jonny explains how it works, and Carlin nods curtly. He agrees that it is the same scheme that has been tried before, and that it will have the same result: a Sun-spot that will grow and eventually engulf the mining ship.
