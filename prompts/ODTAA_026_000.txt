The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is from Hi's perspective, and the tone is one of anxiety and fear.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Hi and the murderer, and to set up the stakes of the story. The author achieves this by having the murderer steal Hi's book, which contains the only evidence that could incriminate him. This act of theft raises the stakes and makes it clear to Hi that the murderer is not going to let him leave the village alive.
