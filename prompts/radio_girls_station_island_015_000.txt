- Jessie Norwood talks to her father about a new super-regenerative circuit she read about and he becomes interested. They decide to build it and test it on their radio.
- Mr. Norwood is practical and when the girls are uncertain how to proceed, it is nice to have somebody like him to turn to.
- The boys are cleaning up the yacht while the girls work on the radio. Nell's Aunt Freda has arrived and Henrietta is playing with little Sally.
- Fred nearly floored Aunt Freda at the start. She says it takes her several hours to get 'acclimated' when she comes to their house.
- Amy Drew tells a story about when she was younger and smeared chocolate cake on her brother's new trousers.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Jessie, Amy, and Nell as practical, level-headed girls, and to contrast them with Henrietta, who is impulsive and flighty. The scene also sets up the conflict between Jessie's desire to build the new radio set and Amy's and Nell's desire to play golf with the boys.

The style of this scene is lighthearted and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person limited.
