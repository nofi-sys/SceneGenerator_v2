Scot McClintock returns to the Dodson camp to find Mollie nursing a black eye. She tells him she fell against the corner of the wagon, but he does not believe her. Vicky tells him that Dodson beat her because she did not have supper ready for him when he came home. Scot is angry and decides to confront Dodson. He finds him in a vacant lot, drunk and sleeping under an empty wagon. Scot tells him to stop beating Mollie and to leave the camp. Dodson refuses, so Scot beats him up and tells him to leave again. This time Dodson leaves and does not return.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Scot and Mollie, and to show how Scot is helping the family.
The author achieves this by having Scot bring food to the family, and by having Vicky tell him about her father's abuse. This establishes Scot as a caring, helpful character, and Mollie as a victim of domestic violence.
