The scene opens with three girls, Jessie, Amy, and Bertha, discussing radio sets. Amy and Bertha are impressed with Monty Shannon's radio set, and Jessie is curious about the difference between her own set and Monty's. Monty explains that his set is a regenerative radio set with an audion detector, which makes it much more selective and therefore able to tune out all but a few commercial stations.
