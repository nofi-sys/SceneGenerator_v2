The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a focus on the characters' dialogue and actions. There is a bit of tension created by the situation (the yacht is sinking and the radio is out), but overall the tone is fairly calm. The point of view is third person limited, with the focus on Jessie's thoughts and feelings.

-Amy: composed, level-headed
-Burd Alling: impatient, easily-angered
-Dr. Stanley: calm, collected
-Darrington (Darry): sober, responsible
-Nell: admonishing, motherly
-Jessie: cheerful, optimistic
-Old Bowser: hard-working

The scene opens with a discussion of the possibility of using the radio to call for help, since the yacht is on fire and sinking. Burd Alling is skeptical that the radio will work, and Dr. Stanley is concerned that they may need to call for help. Darrington, the owner of the yacht, is also worried.
The yacht then pitches sharply and Burd almost falls. The waves are getting rough and the rain is coming down hard. Jessie is worried about the radio not working.
She and Amy go up to the wireless room to try to figure out what is wrong. They quickly realize that the boys have made a mess of the wiring and connections.
 Jessie sighs, wishing they knew as much about radio as the operator at the old lighthouse they had visited. Amy dryly reminds her that he had said he didn't know very much after five years. Jessie agrees that there is always something new to learn about radio.
