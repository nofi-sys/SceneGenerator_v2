The scene is set in a large hall in a castle, which serves as both a council chamber and a banqueting hall. The castle is located on a hill in the town, with the palace meeting the castle in the middle. The castle has a keep which flies the standard in black and white, with a golden leopard and the Lautenburg motto: _Summum decus, flectere_. The hall has two large panelled chambers on the first floor, in the northern wing of the castle, opposite the great court. One of the chambers has an open window which looks out on the terrace and the other chamber has two windows which look out on the ravine where the Melna plunges and roared, and beyond that the Knigsplatz, the barracks of the 182nd Regiment and the Cathedral.
