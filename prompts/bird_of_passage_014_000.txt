Mrs. Creery is talking to Helen about her recent dinner party, and she is not impressed. She then starts to talk about Mr. Lisle, and how he is talking to three European convicts. Helen is surprised to hear this, and Mrs. Creery explains that they are ticket-of-leave men and are allowed to use the garden and library. She then calls Mr. Lisle over and starts to scold him for talking to them. Mr. Lisle defends himself, saying that they are just poor creatures who never have the chance to talk to anyone. Mrs. Creery then invites him to talk to her instead.
