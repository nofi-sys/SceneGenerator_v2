Mrs. Watkins and Julie are discussing Miss Fogg's niece. Julie is trying to get Miss Fogg to write to her niece, but the old woman is being obstinate. Mrs. Watkins tells Julie that she thinks a lot of her and that it would be a sad day for everyone in the house if she left.
This encourages Julie to try again to get Miss Fogg to write to her niece. She brings her some nice paper and tries to persuade her, but Miss Fogg breaks down in tears, saying she can't do it. She explains that her niece is mad at her about something and she's afraid she won't come.
Julie promises to write the letter for her and Miss Fogg agrees. Julie starts the letter with "Madam" and signs it "From a Friend" because she doesn't know the niece's name. She writes urgently, enclosing the sheet of paper with Miss Fogg's words on it.
Finally, she asks Miss Fogg for the niece's address.

The style of this scene is very emotional and heart-wrenching. The point of view is from Julie's perspective, and the tone is one of sympathy and compassion.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Julie and Miss Fogg over the latter's niece. Julie is trying to persuade Miss Fogg to write to her niece, but the old woman is reluctant. The scene also reveals the reason for Miss Fogg's reluctance: she believes her niece has "gone back on her" and she is afraid of being rejected again.
