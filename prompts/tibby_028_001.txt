Donald: a hunter who is also sensitive to the feelings of animals
Tibby: a fashionable woman who is against hunting and killing animals for sport or fashion

The literary style of this scene is playful and flirtatious. The tone is light and teasing, and the point of view is from Donald's perspective.

Donald and Tibby are discussing the hunting of animals and the possibility of animals coming back to haunt hunters after they are killed. Tibby expresses her belief that this is possible and Donald does not argue with her. He changes the subject abruptly, telling her that she looks pretty with her hat tilted in that way. Tibby is offended by his comment and tells him that she will not speak to him for a long time.
