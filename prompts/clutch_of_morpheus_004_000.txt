- Wayne is running out of the building into the street, thinking about the "disturbance of a peculiar nature" that Dr. Felder mentioned.
- He commandeers a taxi and heads to Dr. Felder's house, hoping to find some clues about the strange phenomenon.
- The house is empty, but Wayne finds a dead sample of nerve tissue under a microscope in the laboratory.
- He also finds a note from Dr. Felder, which leads him to the garage where he finds the doctor and his daughter asleep in the car.
- Wayne takes them back to the WRV laboratory, where they are greeted by the other workers.
- Wayne explains that Dr. Felder is the one who solved the problem, and hands over the notes and diagram to Grayson.
