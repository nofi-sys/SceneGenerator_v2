The scene opens with the protagonist, the Red Hawk, preparing for battle. He is mounted on his horse, Red Lightning, and armed with a light shield and a two-edged sword. He is facing the enemy Kalkars, who are massed around their tents. The Kalkars are armed with heavy lances and are backed by heavy horses.
The Red Hawk charges the Kalkars, and the two sides begin to fight. The Kalkars are driven back by the Red Hawk and his allies, but they eventually surge forward and push the Red Hawk and his men back. The fighting continues back and forth, with neither side gaining an advantage.
At one point during the battle, the Red Hawk sees the Wolf, an old, grey chief, fighting nearby. He calls out to him, and the Wolf smiles in recognition. The two men exchange banter about their fighting prowess.
Later, a Kalkar approaches the Red Hawk and tells him that the Jemadar, Or-tis, wants to discuss terms of peace. The Red Hawk laughs and tells the Kalkar that there is only one peace that they can share, and that is the peace of death. He says that he will grant the Jemadar this peace, and the Kalkar leaves.
The fighting continues, and eventually the Red Hawk and his men are victorious.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of the Red Hawk and the Wolf, and to set up the conflict between the Kalkars and the Julians. The author achieves this by having the two characters meet in the midst of the battle and exchange banter. The Kalkar messenger then arrives and delivers his message, which the Red Hawk rejects.
