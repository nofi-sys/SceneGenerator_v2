- Pauline stands up and the man before her turns white. 
- Jean steps forward and Pauline gives him the slightest possible inclination of her head.

- Hester Lvi: dark, handsomely dressed woman; of a race that is hated, feared, and despised; has marvellous great eyes; represents money and brains; makes other women in the room look insignificant

- Lucien: laughs at the situation
- Jean: feels sick and distaste at the performance; silent and slender
- the other end of the room: full of angry whispers
- the dapper-looking man: of early middle age; fat and pink; obsequious; smiles continuously; rubs his hands together
- Monsieur Flaubert: the man from the other end of the room; slimy and greasy

The style of this scene is rather formal and stilted. There is a lot of dialogue, and the characters seem to be speaking in a very polite, formal way. There is a lot of description, both of the characters and of the setting. The tone is somewhat cold and detached.
