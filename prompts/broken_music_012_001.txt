The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of mild amusement.

In the scene, Jean's uncle Romain comes to visit him in his small, modest apartment. Romain is a wealthy man and is amused by the contrast between his own luxurious lifestyle and Jean's more humble circumstances. He tells Jean that he has seen Margot, the girl Jean is infatuated with, and that she is charming but not without her flaws. Romain advises Jean to be more discriminating in his choice of partners, warning him that his current relationship is a "muddle" that will lead nowhere. Jean insists that his relationship with Margot is innocent and that he is only staying with her and her mother because it is the only way he can continue his musical career. Romain is skeptical, but Jean insists that music is the only thing tying them together. Romain ultimately advises Jean to be careful, warning him that innocence is not always a desirable quality.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Jean and his uncle Romain. Romain is a symbol of the materialistic values that Jean rejects, and the scene serves to highlight the differences between them.
