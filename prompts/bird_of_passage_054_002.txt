Helen plans to disguise herself and sell the girls' market goods in town, since their usual worker is injured. Dido objects at first, but eventually agrees.

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. The narrator is third-person omniscient, and the dialogue is naturalistic. There is a sense of urgency and tension throughout, as the characters discuss their options for dealing with a difficult situation.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Dido and Helen over what to do about their uncle's mental illness, and to establish Helen's determination to take matters into her own hands.
