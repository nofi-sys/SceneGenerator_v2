The style of this scene is very suspenseful, with a hint of the supernatural. The point of view is third person omniscient, and the tone is slightly creepy.

The scene is set in a rustic farmhouse, where the furniture is all deliberately old-fashioned. The guests tonight are old Kate, the housekeeper, and her family. They are sitting around the room, drinking tea and listening to old Kate's stories. 
Suddenly, one of the strings on Elsie's harp breaks, causing a loud noise that startles everyone. Old Kate continues her story, about a haunted house with a room that is said to be full of ghosts. 
Just as she is getting to the part where the ghosts appear, they hear slow, heavy footsteps coming up the stairs. Everyone is alarmed, thinking it might be a ghost. But it turns out to be just Bounder, the family dog.

-Old Kate: ancient, wild-eyed, tells spooky stories
-Archie: young boy, helpful
-Elsie: young girl, scared easily
-Peter: young boy, nursing Fuss the dog
-Bounder: the dog
