In the seventh inning, with the score 3-1 in favor of the other team, the pitcher for Grafton, Ben Myatt, begins to falter. The coach calls in a relief pitcher, Gus Weston, who promptly walks the first batter. The bases are now full, with no outs.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a focus on the action of the game. There is a bit of dialogue, but it is mostly exposition. The tone is tense, as the game is close and there is a lot riding on the outcome. The point of view is third person omniscient.
