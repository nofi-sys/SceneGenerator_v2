-Felton: A man who has just been pulled out of a submarine's torpedo tube. He is an expert on torpedoes.
-The man who gave Felton a drink: A member of the submarine's crew.
-The captain of the submarine: A man who looks exactly like the captain of the airship that Felton jumped out of.

A man is sucked into the open tube of a submarine after jumping out of an airship. He is pulled into the lighted handling room, where he is given a drink of some stimulant. He is then able to take in his surroundings and notices that the submarine is very similar to the airship, with the same type of stanchions, air flasks, trimming tanks, and steering gear. He also notices that the crew of the submarine is identical to the crew of the airship. He becomes agitated and accuses the crew of drugging him.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of the surreal. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of confusion and bewilderment.
