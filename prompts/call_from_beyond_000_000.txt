The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of emotion or feeling, and the narrator seems to be simply reporting what he sees. This makes the scene seem all the more surreal and strange.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the character of Frederick West and to establish the setting. West is a space explorer who has landed on an uncharted moon. He is surprised to find a pyramid made of bottles and a space hut. Inside the hut he meets a man who is living there alone. The man is unkempt and appears to be drunk.
The author achieves several goals in this scene. First, they establish the character of Frederick West as someone who is curious and adventurous. Second, they establish the setting as an uncharted moon that is inhabited by a single man. Third, they establish the man as someone who is living in squalor and appears to be drunk. This scene sets up the conflict that West will face in the story: whether or not to help the man.

Frederick West lands on Pluto's moon, where he finds a pyramid made of bottles. He also finds a space hut, but there is no sign of life. He enters the hut and finds a man sitting on the edge of a cot. The man is unkempt and has a bottle of whisky. The man offers West a drink, but West declines. West looks around the hut and sees that there is no radio. The man tells West that he is drinking himself to death. West is astounded at the man's poverty and squalor.
