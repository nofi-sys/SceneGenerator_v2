The scene opens with the young d'Aillane speaking to the protagonist's father about his daughter. He says that he is sure of her innocence and that he will not let anything stand in the way of her happiness. The father replies that he knows of d'Aillane's reputation and that he trusts him. The protagonist then interrupts, saying that she knows of certain testimony in d'Aillane's favor that she cannot reveal without being laughed at. However, she says, this testimony is so serious to her that she is convinced of his innocence despite appearances.
The young d'Aillane asks who this testimony is from, and the protagonist replies that she would rather not say. He then takes his leave, but she asks him to come back into her room for a moment. There, she tells him that she is convinced of his innocence and that she is determined to fight for him. However, she says, he must grant her a meeting the following day so that she can prove her courage.
D'Aillane agrees, and they part ways.

The purpose of this scene is to establish a conflict between the two characters, and to set up the resolution of that conflict. The author achieves this by having the two characters argue with each other, and then eventually come to an understanding.
