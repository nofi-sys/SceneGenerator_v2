Ruth is riding her horse through the forest, enjoying the scenery and the peace of being alone, when she comes across a grove of pine trees. She decides to stop and read a letter from her husband, Rowan, that she received from the post office that day. The letter fills her with happiness and she thanks God for it. 
Rowan is in prison, but his letters to Ruth are always full of hope and love. In this particular letter, he talks about how he has been reading poems by Robert Browning and how they have been helping him to keep a positive outlook. He quotes one of the poems to her, which is about how the best is yet to come and that we should trust God and not be afraid. 
Ruth sits in the pine grove, reading and re-reading the letter from her husband, until it starts to get dark. She then rides back to the ranch, her heart full of love for him.
