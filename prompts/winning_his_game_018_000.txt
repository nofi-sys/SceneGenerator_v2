The scene opens with the coach meeting Dud at third base. The coach appears calm, but his jumbled speech betrays his nervousness. He asks Dud if he thinks he can pitch the team to a win, and Dud is too honest to lie, so he says nothing.
Murtha, the team captain, greets Dud and tries to encourage him, but it is clear he is not thrilled with the coach's decision to put Dud in the game. He tells Dud to let the catcher call the pitches and just focus on getting the batter out.
Dud begins warming up and the Lawrence team's bench starts jeering him. Nick Blake, one of Dud's teammates, calls out to him and tells him the team is behind him.
Dud pitches to the first batter and gets him to strike out. The crowd cheers and Dud's confidence begins to grow. He pitches to the second batter and gets him to pop out.
The third batter walks, bringing the tying run to the plate. Dud knows he cannot afford to let the batter get on base, so he throws a fastball down the middle of the plate. The batter swings and misses, strike three, and the Grafton team wins the game.
