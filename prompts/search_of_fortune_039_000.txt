The purpose of this scene is to establish the theme of homesickness, and to show how it is affecting the main character, Archie. The author also uses this scene to foreshadow Bob's decision to return to England.

Archie is discussing with his friends the possibility of moving his family to Australia to join him. He is worried that his father will be too attached to their farm in England to want to leave, but Bob reassures him that it is possible to transplant people just as one would a tree. Sarah interrupts to bring them coffee, and Bob mentions that he himself is planning to return to England to visit his mother's grave.
