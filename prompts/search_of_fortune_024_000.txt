Archie has just recovered from an illness and is feeling better than ever. He is excited to start work and begin earning money again. His uncle sends him a bill of exchange for fifty pounds, which Archie accepts as a loan. He goes to tell his friends Bob and Harry about it and they are all excited for him. They decide to have a dinner to celebrate and invite a few friends.

The purpose of this scene is to show Archie's reaction to receiving a loan from his uncle, and to establish the plan for Bob's upcoming marriage. The author achieves these goals by having Archie discuss the situation with Bob and Harry, and by having Bob outline his plans for the wedding.
