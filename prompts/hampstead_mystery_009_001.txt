The style of this scene is rather dry and matter-of-fact. There is a sense of foreboding and tension underlying the dialogue, but it is not overtly expressed. The point of view is third person omniscient.

The scene opens with a conversation between Frederick and Philip Walcheren. Frederick is anxious about his wife's soul, and Philip is trying to console him. Philip explains that the girl will have to go through purgatory, but they can pray for her and help her by giving up their own pleasures.
Mr Crampton and Mr Hindes then enter the room, and the sight of the dead body shocks them both. Mr Crampton accuses Frederick of murder, and Philip Walcheren orders them both to leave.
The landlord then comes in and tells them that the coroner and jury are coming to view the body. The two men are hustled into another room, where they sit glaring at each other until they are called to give evidence.
The first witnesses called are the two boatmen who found Jenny's body. They explain that they were on the lower beach when they saw something lying at the bottom of the cliffs. They went to investigate and found that it was Jenny's body.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Frederick Walcheren and Philip Walcheren, and to set up the conflict between them. The author also establishes the setting and introduces the other characters who will be important to the story.
