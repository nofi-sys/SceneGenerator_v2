The literary style of this scene is one of compassion and empathy. Julie is clearly disturbed by the state of Miss Fogg's room, but she does her best to remain calm and comforting. The tone is one of pity and concern, and the point of view is from Julie's perspective.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Miss Fogg and to create sympathy for her. The author achieves this by showing Miss Fogg's vulnerability and her desperation.

Julie is out at the market, wishing that her boyfriend Tim was there to share in the delight of the experience with her. She eventually chooses a little bunch of blue nigella, love-in-a-mist flowers to take home.
Later, Julie musters up the courage to knock on Miss Fogg's door, holding the flowers she bought for her in one hand. After waiting for a moment with no response, she turns the handle and walks in, surprised to find that the door was unlocked.
Her first impression of the room is of its ill-smelling and untidy state. Miss Fogg is standing by the side of her bed, glaring at her with furious, sunken eyes. She is wearing a soiled and torn nightgown, her gray hair is wild and falls upon her neck, and her feet are bare.
The old woman immediately begins to berate Julie, screaming at her that she was just trying to come in and pry, sticking her nose where she has no business. She accuses Julie of wanting to run out and tell everyone how old and dirty Miss Fogg is.
Julie denies these accusations, trying to explain that she just wanted to bring her some flowers and make friends. This only makes Miss Fogg angrier, and she begins a strange dance, kicking her feet out at Julie and yelling at her to look at them.
The distressed old woman eventually sinks down on the edge of her bed, weeping. Julie comes over to try and comfort her, telling her that she will mend her nightgown for her. Miss Fogg continues to weep, shaking uncontrollably and muttering about how cruel it is that she can't even be left alone when she's sick and miserable.
