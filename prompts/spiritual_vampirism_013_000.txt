In a large house in Bond Street, a group of people are gathered around Manton as he talks. The group consists of Manton, the woman Marie Orne, her daughter, and Dr. E. Willamot Weasel. Manton is speaking about his favorite topics, and the group is enraptured by his words. The mother and daughter are both dressed in simple, elegant clothing, which pleases Manton. He feels grateful and happy to be in their company.

-Manton: a poet, idealizes woman, shy around women of society
-Marie Orne: a woman who is suggestible and easily influenced
- her daughter: impish-looking, sad eyes
-Dr. E. Willamot Weasel: dark eye, benevolent, looks upon the group with delight

The purpose of this scene is to establish the bond between Manton and the mother and daughter, and to show how Manton is drawn to them by their appreciation of him.
