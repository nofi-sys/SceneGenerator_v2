The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing objective description of the events. There is a bit of dialogue, but mostly the narrator is summarizing what is happening. The tone is fairly matter-of-fact, though there is a hint of emotion near the end when the men bury their friends.

The scene opens with the twelve men on the war trail, marching against a tribe of over 150 warriors. They are armed and ready for the fight, but they are also outnumbered and outmatched.
Archie, the leader of the group, calls for a halt and asks who will be the commander of the force. Craig volunteers, and Archie agrees.
Craig then suggests that they turn back and head for Findlayson's farm. The others agree, and they start to make their way back.
As they are dismounting to enter the farm, they are met by Jacoby, a black stockman. He is excited and tells them that he has seen the blacks, who are now heading in a different direction.
 Craig and the others decide to track the blacks and try to stop them before they can commit more atrocities. They bury their dead friends and set off in pursuit.
As they are tracking the blacks, they come across a storehouse that has been ransacked. They find food and supplies, and pack them up to take with them.
They eventually catch up to the blacks and engage them in battle. The fight is fierce, but the twelve men are eventually victorious.
