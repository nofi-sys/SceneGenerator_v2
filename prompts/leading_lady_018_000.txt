The purpose of this scene is to reveal that Joe was the one who killed Stokes, not Anne. The author achieves this goal by having Anne remember seeing Joe in Sebastian's costume, and then finding out that the Sebastian costume is missing from Joe's trunk.

- Anne is sitting on her bed, reviewing the events of the night, trying to make sense of what she saw. 
- She remembers seeing a figure in the living room, and realizes that it was Joe, dressed as Sebastian, who was killed by Stokes. 
- She also realizes that Sybil is alive and hiding somewhere. 
- She runs to Joe's room and looks through his trunk for the Sebastian costume, but it is gone. 
- She hears a sound from the floor above and runs up to find Sybil. 
- They stare at each other in disbelief before Anne finally speaks.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its suspenseful, mysterious tone. The point of view is limited to Anne's perspective, and the reader is given only the information that Anne is aware of. This creates a sense of unease and tension, as the reader does not know what is going to happen next.
