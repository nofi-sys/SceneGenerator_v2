The scene takes place at a dinner party, where the conversation turns to horse racing. Jack Blair teases Sylvia about her faith in a certain horse, and old Tom Shapleigh jokingly promises his wife a grand funeral. Elizabeth Blair grows paler and paler as the conversation continues, and Skelton eventually says that he will double his subscription to the horse racing club. This prompts Jack Blair to say that he will also raise his subscription, much to the amusement of the other guests. Mrs. Blair playfully chides her husband for his racing obsession, and the conversation turns to Skelton's travels. Sylvia flirts with Skelton, and Bulstrode whispers to Conyers that the whole thing is a 'spectacle'.
