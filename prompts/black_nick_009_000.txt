1. John Stark - A tall, raw-boned man with a stern face and sharp black eyes. He is the leader of the militia and is very impatient and passionate.
2. Adrian Schuyler - A handsome man with an open face. He is related to General Philip Schuyler and is very indignant.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of John Stark and to establish his personality and beliefs. The author achieves this by having Stark refuse to follow orders that he disagrees with, even if it means going against the wishes of a superior.

Adrian Schuyler, a Continental Army officer, has been captured by the British and is being held prisoner. He escapes and makes his way to the town of Derryfield, where he hopes to find General John Stark and enlist his aid.
Stark is initially skeptical of Schuyler's story, but he eventually believes him and agrees to help. However, he makes it clear that he will not be taking orders from anyone, and that he intends to stay in Derryfield.
This frustrates and angers Schuyler, who tries to convince Stark to change his mind. Stark is unmoved, and Schuyler is forced to return to General Schuyler empty-handed.
