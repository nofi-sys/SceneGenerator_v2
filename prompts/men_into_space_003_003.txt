Major McCauley is in a space suit with a tether to a large mass of equipment behind him, and he is spinning around. He cuts the tether to the equipment, sending it flying back toward the spidery metal framework (the Platform), and himself moving away faster. He knows that this will likely kill him, but he hopes to save Lieutenant Sammy Breen, who is also tethered to the Platform and in danger of being pulled into space and killed.
McCauley cuts his own tether and floats away from the Platform. He knows that he only has a few minutes before he will succumb to the cold and lack of oxygen in space. He tries to throw his tether back to the Platform, but it falls short. He then systematically starts throwing all of his equipment, including his space suit, away from him in an attempt to change his velocity and drift back toward the Platform.
He is unsuccessful, and eventually dies in space.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of urgency.

-Sammy Breen: an astronaut who is clumsy and makes mistakes
-McCauley: an astronaut who is in charge and is very strict
-Randy: an astronaut who is helping Sammy and McCauley
