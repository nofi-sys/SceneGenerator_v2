The purpose of this scene is to reveal the protagonist's discovery to the reader, and to establish the reaction of the Grand Duchess. The author achieves these goals by having the protagonist recount his story to the Grand Duchess and Melusine, who both react with surprise and disbelief.

Aurora is in her boudoir with her waiting woman, Melusine, when the narrator arrives. He is visibly shaken and Aurora immediately guesses that something is wrong. He tells her the story of his investigation into the Knigsmark murder, and how he found a skeleton in the Lautenburg palace with an old fracture on the right tibia. Aurora is horrified, and accuses the narrator of being mad.

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact, almost clinical. The narrator is telling the story of what happened in a dispassionate way, and the dialogue is also fairly flat. There is a sense of foreboding throughout, however, as the reader knows that the narrator is about to reveal something that will upset Aurora.
