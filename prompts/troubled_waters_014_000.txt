The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of emotion or drama, and the focus is entirely on the details of the investigation. This gives the reader a clear sense of what is happening, but does not provide any insight into the characters' inner thoughts or feelings.

The scene opens with Sheriff Matson tracking the raiders who attacked the Circle Diamond Ranch. He uses his knowledge of the land and the tracks left behind to follow them to the Three Pines, where he finds that they have split up. He follows the tracks of one group to the Circle Diamond Ranch, where he finds Mrs. Stovall. They exchange pleasantries and Mrs. Stovall tells him that the men he is looking for left that morning. Matson thanks her and goes to look at Mac's guns in the living room. He finds that one of the guns is missing and deduces that it was the one used in the attack. He also finds a boot print on the blanket and concludes that it was left by one of the men he is looking for.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the sheriff's expertise as a tracker, and to establish a possible suspect in the case of the night raiders.
