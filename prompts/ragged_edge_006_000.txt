The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by introducing the characters through their dialogue.

The scene takes place on a Thursday morning in a working-class neighborhood in an unspecified city. O'Connor and Roddy Ferguson have just arrived to set up for the funeral of an unnamed man. Old Mrs. Sweeney is also there, helping to get things ready. The clock of St. Michaels church strikes nine, and the funeral procession is set to begin.
 Hack drivers from neighboring livery stables begin to arrive and line up at the curb. The women of the neighborhood start to gather inside the house, while the men mostly stay outside on the sidewalk. A group of young men are smoking and laughing near Clancys coal box.
Goose McGonagle comes up and tells them that he is going to be a pall bearer and that Larry (presumably the man organizing the funeral) wants five more men to help. Nolan and McGlory volunteer immediately. Jimmie Larkin is reluctant, but Danny Casey and Mike McCarty agree to help. Goose goes back inside to get another pall bearer.
The group resumes their comments on the people passing by. They see Kelly and his wife, Mart, and a number of other people from the neighborhood. Rosie OHara, who is wearing a black dress, comes out and Jimmie Larkin goes to talk to her. She tells him to put their names down so they can be called out as part of the procession.
Roddy Ferguson comes out and hands out black cotton gloves and streamers of crape to the pall bearers. The funeral procession is about to begin.
