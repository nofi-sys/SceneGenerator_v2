- Jean is lying in a field, thinking about his future
- He is 20 years old and has no talents or prospects
- His Aunt Prenderghast is his only relative and she is very strict
- She tells him that his Uncle Romain has written to suggest a profession for him
- Jean is not interested in any of the options his uncle has suggested
- His aunt tells him he must make a decision soon
- Jean is angry and kicks the table leg

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Jean and his aunt, Miss Prenderghast. The author achieves this goal by showing the reader how Jean and Miss Prenderghast view each other and the situation differently.

The literary style of this scene is formal and stilted. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of reproach and disappointment.
