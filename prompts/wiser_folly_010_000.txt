The literary style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and dry. There is no emotion or feeling conveyed in the writing, and the focus is purely on the events and the facts of the situation.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict in the story. The author achieves this by introducing the character of David Delancey, the rightful heir to the property, and showing how the news of his arrival affects the other characters.
