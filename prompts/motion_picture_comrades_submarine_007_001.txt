The purpose of this scene is to provide exposition and advance the plot. The characters discuss what they believe to have happened after they hit something while underwater in their submarine, and they speculate about what it could have been. This leads to a discussion of the different features of the ocean floor, which provides information that will be important later on in the story.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a focus on dialogue and action. There is a bit of tension and suspense, but overall it is not a particularly dramatic or emotional scene.
