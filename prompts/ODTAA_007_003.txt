Hi and Rosa are cutting linen for Easter frocks when Rosa's cousin, Carlotta de Leyva, arrives. Carlotta is a very special person and Hi is warned not to fall in love with her.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Hi and Rosa, and to introduce the character of Carlotta. The author achieves this by having the characters discuss the political situation in Santa Barbara, and by having Hi agree to help Rosa with her work.

Hi: Hi is the protagonist of the scene. He is a young man who has recently arrived in Santa Barbara. He is polite and well-meaning, but naïve and ignorant of the political situation in the town.
Rosa: Rosa is Hi's love interest. She is a local girl, of mixed White and Native American heritage. She is practical and level-headed, and serves as a voice of reason for Hi.
The market people: These are the people who cheered for Rosa when she walked by. They are not described in detail, but are presumably White residents of Santa Barbara.
The Reds: The Reds are the political opponents of the Whites. They are in power at the time of the scene, and are described as being corrupt and tyrannical.
The Whites: The Whites are the political opponents of the Reds. They are not in power at the time of the scene, and are described as being naïve and foolish.
The Pitubas: The Pitubas are a tribe of Native Americans who live in Santa Barbara. They are considered to be savage and dangerous by the Whites, but Rosa says they are not so bad.
