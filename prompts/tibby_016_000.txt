All present are spiritists, except for Garrett, who is a recent convert. Mrs. Price is especially absorbed in the creed, to the point of appearing unbalanced. Mrs. Jenkinson is a nervous medium. The Pemberton twins are so identical that even their mother has trouble telling them apart. They claim to share the same visions and communications since becoming spiritists.
Mr. McCleary is a small, quiet man who usually lets his wife do the talking. He is an honest and hard-working neighbor, and spends his free time with a planchette. Mrs. McCleary is a short, plump woman with black eyes and blue-black hair. She is always talking and imagines herself to be an invalid.
George McCleary is an unremarkable college student, but his sister Esther is the center of the community. She is only eighteen, but she is responsible for the care of her six younger siblings and the running of the household. She is also a skilled seamstress, cook, and nurse.
