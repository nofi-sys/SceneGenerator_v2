-Fay: the protagonist and narrator, a professional thief
-The three card players:
-Cockney with a great arching nose and a loose catfish mouth: Harry's partner
-Stout and triple chinned: the Yorkshire squire
-The man with the glasses: Ace-in-the-hole Harry, an international swindler
-The under-steward: brings Fay his drink

Fay turns away from the other passengers on the ship and goes to the front to look out the window. He sees three men playing cards in the smoking room and realizes they are playing American stud. He watches as one of the men, who is wearing smoked glasses, wins several hands in a row. Fay becomes interested and decides to go into the smoking room.
He walks in and the man with the glasses, who he recognizes as a professional gambler, greets him. Fay orders a drink and sits down to watch the game. He sees that the gambler is cheating the other players and decides to intervene.
He walks over to the table and distracts the gambler long enough for the other players to see what he is doing. They accuse him of cheating and he is forced to leave the game. Fay feels satisfied that he has stopped the gambler from cheating the other passengers on the ship.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Ace-in-the-hole Harry, a professional gambler and card sharp. The author uses this scene to establish Harry's skills and to set up the conflict that will occur later in the story when the protagonist, Fay, tries to take on Harry at his own game.
