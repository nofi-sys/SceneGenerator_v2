The scene opens with the three main characters, Jessie, Amy, and Nell, discussing their recent hike and picnic. The girls had spied an inlet on the shore of the island they were on and had seen several fish houses and rowboats that they were sure they could hire. Amy expressed a desire to sail in the inlet, and Nell said she would row.
The girls found an old fisherman who was willing to hire them a boat, and they set off. The old man warned them about the weather, but the girls paid him no mind.
Soon, a squall began to blow and the old man's warnings proved true. The girls struggled to keep the boat from capsizing and finally made it to shore. The old man was there to meet them, and he scolded them for their carelessness.
Despite the old man's warnings, the girls decided to set off again the next day. This time, they were more careful and had a pleasant sail. They were even joined by a boy in a catboat who shouted something to them, but they didn't hear what he said.
The scene ends with the girls safely back on shore, tired but happy from their adventure.
