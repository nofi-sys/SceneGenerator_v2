The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Doctor Ebenezer Willamot Weasel and to establish his relationship with the protagonist, Manton. The author achieves this by having the two characters interact with each other in a dialogue.

1. In a room in the Graham House, a young man is writing at a table.
2. A light tap is heard at the door, and a young man enters.
3. The visitor is Doctor Ebenezer Willamot Weasel, who is concerned about the writer's isolation from social life.
4. The writer, Manton, is cold and distant with the visitor.
5. The visitor insists that Manton needs to relax and accept the sympathies of others.
6. Manton is vexed by the visitor's intrusion.

The literary style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The point of view is third person omniscient. The tone is one of polite inquiry, with a hint of impatience from the visitor.
