The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of drama or suspense, and the tone is almost conversational. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Hannah.

Henry Hindes and his wife, Hannah, receive a letter from Arthur Hindes, Henry's younger brother, announcing that he and his family are moving back to England from Bombay. Arthur's wife, Edith, has been ill and the doctor has recommended that she not stay in Bombay for another hot season. Arthur plans to move back to England for three years so that his children can attend school there, and then return to India.
Henry is not pleased with the news, as he and Hannah have been trying to keep a low profile since a scandalous incident involving their son, Wally. The scandal has left them both feeling nervous and uneasy around each other, and they have been trying to avoid each other as much as possible.
Arthur's news means that they will have to open up their home, The Old Hall, to guests again, something they had been hoping to avoid. Henry is also worried about what people will think when they see how much Hannah has changed since the incident.
Despite all of this, Hannah is excited at the prospect of seeing her family again and is looking forward to their visit.
