The purpose of this scene is to show the capture of the rustlers by the Manley boys and their friends.

The scene opens with Roy and Teddy Manley riding into the yards of the X Bar X ranch. They are met by Mrs. Manley, who Teddy tells of their good news - they know where the stolen horses are. Mr. Manley is preparing to ride out and Teddy is sent to tell the other ranch hands to get ready.
Mrs. Manley is proud of her boys as they set off to join the other men. They ride to the north fence, where they wait for the rustlers. The rustlers come riding over the moonlit prairie and the leader jumps from his horse to cut the fence.
Mr. Manley fires a shot and the rustlers are surrounded by the ranch hands. Three of the rustlers ride off and the fourth is cornered. He is the one with the scar on his face, and he is captured.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person omniscient. The tone is one of excitement and anticipation.
