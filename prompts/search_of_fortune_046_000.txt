The style of this scene is dramatic, with a touch of romance. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of suspense and excitement.

A group of squatters are attacked by savages, and three of them are killed. Craig is grievously wounded, but the rest of the group manages to make it back to their farm. Diana goes to meet her father, Bob, and tell him what happened. Craig is nursed back to health by Elsie.
