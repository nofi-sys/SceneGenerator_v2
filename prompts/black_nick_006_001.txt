The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the conflict. The author achieves this by describing the stormy weather and the appearance of the demon.

A hussar named Adrian Schuyler is telling Diana, a girl he just met, about how he came to be on the mountain. He was brought there by a group of Indians and Tories, but escaped last night when a strange creature, which Diana calls a demon, came into their camp and frightened everyone away. Diana begs Adrian to leave, saying that the demon will kill him if he stays, but he refuses, saying that he has to get to Derryfield on a mission. Suddenly, the demon's horn sounds, and Diana disappears into the woods. Adrian follows her, but loses sight of her. He eventually finds himself in a clearing during a storm, but Diana is nowhere to be found.
