The scene opens with Mrs. McGonagle entering the store and greeting the occupants. She is a plump little woman with a rosy face and is wearing a brightly colored scarf. She asks about Larry Murphy and if they have heard about his death.
OHara says that he can see nothing good coming from it, and Mrs. McGonagle agrees. She goes on to say that Larry was a good boy who never drank, and she can't understand why he would be treated so.
The gong sounds and a girl comes rushing in, asking for candles and a crucifix. Ellen gives them to her and she hurries out, telling Mrs. McGonagle to tell Larry that his grandfather wants to see him before he dies.
Mrs. McGonagle is amazed and delighted by the news and hurries off to tell Larry. OHara and the two old crones are left behind, shaking their heads in wonder.

The style of this scene is lighthearted and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person omniscient.
