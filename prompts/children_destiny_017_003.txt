Skelton is in love with Sylvia Shapleigh, and he realizes that he needs to tell her about Lewis in order to marry her. He also realizes that if he can convince the Blairs that Lewis is not their son, he can keep the whole matter private. He works hard to accumulate proof of Lewis's parentage, and he also begins to make plans to ask Sylvia to marry him. Meanwhile, Lewis takes a sudden interest in his studies. Skelton eventually calls him into the library and tells him that he is going to fight for him.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Lewis and Skelton, and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story.

The style of this scene is rather formal and stilted. The dialogue is stiff and the characters seem to be holding back from each other. There is a sense of tension and unease between them.
