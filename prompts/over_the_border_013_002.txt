The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Jim and Fred, and to set up the conflict between them. Jim is a tough, no-nonsense sailor who has been through a lot in his career. He is unafraid of violence and is willing to accept the consequences of his actions. Fred, on the other hand, is a weak and cowardly man who is easily scared and quick to cry. He is also easily influenced by others, as evidenced by the fact that he began drinking and fighting only after meeting Jim.

The style of this scene is harsh and violent. There is a lot of dialogue, which gives the reader a sense of the characters' personalities. The tone is tense and suspenseful, and the point of view is third person limited.
