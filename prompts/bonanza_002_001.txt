2. Nevada Jim: His best chance, he decided, lay in the speed of the bay. As soon as he had crossed the rangeif he ever got acrosshe would try to run the Indian ponies off their legs.
3. Big Chief Heap-in-a-Hurry: Big Chief Heap-in-a-Hurry aims to collect me, the boy told himself aloud. Me, I got different notions.
