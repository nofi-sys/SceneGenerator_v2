The style of this scene is very straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is a sense of urgency in the short, terse sentences, but no real emotion or feeling. The point of view is third person omniscient.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the characters and to establish the conflict. The author achieves this by having the Manley boys meet their father, who tells them that their broncs have been rustled.

Mr. Manley and his two sons, Roy and Teddy, are on their way to the X Bar X ranch when they spot a group of rustlers stealing their horses. They quickly jump into action, getting their guns and saddling up their ponies to go after the thieves.
Mrs. Manley, the boys' mother, is waiting for them at the ranch house and is surprised to see them arrive in an automobile instead of on horseback. Mr. Manley quickly explains what has happened and kisses her goodbye before rushing off with the boys.
 Belle Ada, the sister of Roy and Teddy, comes out to meet the girls and invites them to visit the ranch again soon. Teddy and Roy say their goodbyes and the girls are on their way.
As they are driving away, Mrs. Manley tells her sons that their father wants to speak to them before they go after the rustlers. Teddy and Roy are surprised and wonder what he could want to tell them.
When they meet back up with their father, he tells them that he thinks there is more to the story than the rustlers are letting on. He thinks that someone at the Eagles corral might know more than they are saying.
The boys saddle up and ride off with their father to go after the rustlers. Mrs. Manley is worried for their safety but Teddy and Roy assure her that they will be fine.
