Dud and Jimmy are caught breaking curfew and are brought to Mr. Russell's office. Mr. Russell lectures them and tells them to go to their room for the rest of the evening. The next day, they are called into Dr. Duncan's office and are reprimanded. They are told that they need to apply themselves to their studies more diligently. Nick and Jimmy then retrieve their lost canoe. At the end of the week, Dud finds himself sitting with Nick and Hugh, discussing baseball. He is surprised to find himself included, but is happy to be there.

The style of this scene is lighthearted and humorous. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is playful and friendly.
