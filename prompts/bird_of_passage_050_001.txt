Miss Denis and Mr. Redmond are discussing the new flower beds and yew trees at the estate when they are interrupted by Barry and Miss Calderwood. Miss Calderwood is surprised to learn that Miss Denis knew Gilbert Lisle "intimately" and proceeds to interrogate her about him. Helen is reluctant to answer but eventually reveals that Lisle was at the Andamans for six months. Miss Calderwood assumes he was in a scrape of some sort and walks away.

-Mr. Redmond: an older man, Gilbert Lisle's uncle
-Helen Denis: a young woman, Gilbert Lisle's acquaintance from the Andamans
-Miss Calderwood: a young woman, Gilbert Lisle's betrothed

The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The dialogue is stiff and the characters seem to be holding back their true feelings. There is a sense of tension and unease throughout the scene.
