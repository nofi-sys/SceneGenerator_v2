The scene opens with a conversation between an American and an Englishman. The American is telling the Englishman that he knows the Whites will win the upcoming battle because he is experienced in fighting. The Englishman is skeptical. Suddenly, an old woman who is also in the wagon starts speaking in English. She tells the American that he is a liar and curses him. The American tries to calm her down, but she continues to curse him and the other soldiers. 
The scene then shifts to the Pitubas moving into the city. There is confusion and delay at the gate, but they eventually make it through. A mulatto with a green ostrich plume in his hat tells them that they are Suspecteds and need to go to the Church of the Sanctity of Lopez. 
When they arrive at the church, the American tells one of the Red officers that they are American and English citizens and should be sent to their respective consuls. The officer explains that they are not being gaoled, but are simply being sheltered until the situation is resolved. 
The American and the Englishman are both sent to their respective consuls, but Hi is told that his hotel is closed and the English Club is also closed. He is eventually also sent to the English Consul.

-The Englishman: skeptical of the American's claims
-The old drunken woman: aggressive and cursing in both English and Spanish
-The officer: polite but firm in his orders
-Hi: a Santiago hotel guest who just wants to return to his hotel
