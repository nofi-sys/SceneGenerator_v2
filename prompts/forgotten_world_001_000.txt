The style of this scene is tense and dramatic. The point of view is from Carlin's perspective, and the tone is one of frustration and anger.

Carlin, a space engineer, is meeting with a psychotherapist to discuss his fatigue. The therapist tells him that he is "star-sick" and needs to take a break from space travel. Carlin is resistant at first, but the therapist convinces him that he needs to go to Earth, the planet of their ancestors, for a year-long treatment. Carlin is reluctant but agrees to go.
