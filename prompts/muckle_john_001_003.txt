The scene opens with the stranger speaking to Miss Macpherson. He explains that he is new to Inverness and is staying there until tomorrow. The stranger's eyes are alert and they scan the room. They pause on the rope in Mr. Macaulay's hands and then move to Rob. The stranger does not appear to recognize Rob, which disappoints him. Mr. Macaulay tells the stranger that he was just looking for him. The stranger replies that he has seen the rope in Mr. Macaulay's hands and suggests that it could be put to better use. Mr. Macaulay suddenly bolts from the room and the stranger closes and bolts the door.
The stranger asks Rob his name and then introduces himself. He tells Rob that he is from the Highlands and has just returned from fighting in Europe. The stranger says that he does not like to see the bairns and dying men in the army and that this is not war. The scene ends with the stranger telling Rob that he saw him the day after the army had passed.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the stranger, and to establish his character. The stranger is a mysterious, foreign-looking man with a very persuasive voice. He is also very tall and has a great Highland nose. The author establishes his character as someone who is very honest and straightforward, and who is also a good judge of character.
