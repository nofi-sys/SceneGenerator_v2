A man and a boy are talking on a ship. The boy is going to Australia to make his fortune and the man is telling him about all the wonderful things he will see there. The man describes the upside-down world of Australia, where the people walk with their heads downwards and the animals walk on two legs. He also tells the boy about the different kinds of birds, including the black swans, the lyre-bird, and the kingfisher.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the concept of Australia as a land of upside-down wonders, where the people walk with their heads downwards and the animals walk on two legs. The author also introduces the idea of the lyre-bird, a beautiful bird that is prized by the natives.
