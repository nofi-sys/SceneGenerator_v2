-Eliza Creery: a pertinacious woman who is after Helen's black silk gown.
-Helen: the woman Creery is interrogating. She is pale and wincing.

-Ayah: the woman who brings the parcel to Helen.

The style of this scene is light and humorous. The tone is slightly mocking, and the point of view is from an omniscient third person.

Mrs. Creery tries to convince Helen to sell her clothes for money, but Helen refuses. Mrs. Creery then tries to trade a shoulder cape for something else, but the only thing she has to offer in return is a pair of shell bracelets worth only eighteen pence.
