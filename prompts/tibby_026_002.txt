-Mark: protagonist, Mrs. Wylie's caretaker, trying to figure out what has happened to Horace
-Tibby: Mark's assistant, helps take care of Mrs. Wylie, has a dislike for the woman on the boat

Mark and Tibby discuss the possible reasons for Mrs. Wylie's mental breakdown and eventual suicide. They conclude that it is likely due to her husband's infidelity, and Mark suggests that the other woman may have been involved in spiritism, which unbalanced Mrs. Wylie's mind.

The style of this scene is formal and serious. The tone is one of shock and disbelief, and the point of view is third person limited.
