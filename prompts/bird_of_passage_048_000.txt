The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Andy, who is described as being "not quite all there." The author achieves this goal by having the character of Dido interact with him in a friendly way, showing that despite his mental disability, he is still a valuable member of the community.

-The scene takes place on the grounds of an old estate which is in a state of disrepair.
-The estate is owned by an eccentric man who is rarely seen.
-The man's daughters, Dido and Katie, give a tour of the property to their cousin, Helen.
-The tour includes the dairy, the garden, and the turf-house (where the man's mule is kept).
-In the garden, they are joined by a man called 'All Right' who helps with the gardening.

The style of this scene is rather matter-of-fact and practical. There is not much description of the setting, and the focus is more on the characters and their actions. The tone is somewhat dry and humorous.
