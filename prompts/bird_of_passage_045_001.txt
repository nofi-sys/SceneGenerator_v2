Mrs. Durand and Mr. Lisle are discussing Apollo Quentin and his recent marriage to a rich widow. Mr. Lisle is angry with Apollo for what he perceives to be dishonorable conduct towards Helen Denis, a woman whom Apollo was previously engaged to. Mrs. Durand insists that Mr. Lisle is wrong and that Helen never wanted to marry Apollo. She tells him that the ring Apollo gave to his wife was actually stolen from Helen by Fatima, a servant, and sold for twenty rupees.

-Mr. Lisle: dark-haired man, listener in the conversation

-Apollo Quentin: friend of Mr. Lisle, married to a rich widow
-Miss Denis: jilted by Apollo Quentin, poor girl
-Captain Rodney: man, mentioned as someone Miss Denis would rather talk to

-Fatima: native woman, stole Miss Denis' ring

The literary style of this scene is formal and polite. The tone is one of anger and frustration, and the point of view is third person limited.
