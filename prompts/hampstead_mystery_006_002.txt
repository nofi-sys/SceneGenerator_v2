The literary style of this scene is formal and polite. The tone is one of concern and worry, and the point of view is third person limited.

Mr Hindes is upset about his daughter's impending marriage to a man he believes to be a scoundrel. He goes to the nursery to see his son and heir, but is reminded of Jenny's face when she defied him. He wipes his kiss off the child's brow and leaves. Mrs Hindes asks if he will look at their daughters, and he says he will. She then mentions that Jenny's marriage may have a happy ending after all, and he says he will pray for it.
