- The scene opens with Harry and his sister in the Braithwaite carriage on their way home from church. 
- Harry is disappointed with Miss Lane; he thought she was prettier from a distance. 
- They reach the Grange and the ladies go upstairs. Harry meets his brother George in the stable yard. 
- George tells Harry that he saw him staring at Miss Lane in church. Harry tells George that he is his discovery and that he won't have him monopolizing her. 
- The dinner bell rings and they go into the dining room. Harry takes George's seat next to Miss Lane. 
- George tells Harry that he would give the world at this moment to pitch him out of the window.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Harry and George, and to set up the conflict between them for the rest of the story. The author achieves this by having them argue with each other and by having George try to flirt with Miss Lane, who is clearly not interested in him.

1. Miss Lane: the Mainwarings governess; pretty, shy, and brave.
2. Harry: one of the Mainwarings brothers; less talkative than usual around Miss Lane.
3. George: another of the Mainwarings brothers; tells Harry he admires Miss Lane from a distance.
4. William: the youngest of the Mainwarings brothers; very shy around women, but quickly warms up to Miss Lane.
