The style of this scene is light and airy, with a touch of humor. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is playful and curious.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the conflict. The conflict is that the children want to go to the island, but the tide is going out and it is a long way.

The scene opens with Maida and Rosie on their bicycles, just as they emerge from the Westabrook estate. Maida sees Silva Burle walking along the trail towards the Little House and wonders what she is doing there. Rosie is sure that Silva is not calling on them and is glad that their grandmother will say "not at home."
The scene shifts to Crescent Moon Beach, where the group of children has arrived. They comment on the beauty of the beach and the island in the distance. Maida tells them that she has been to the island before and it is full of trees, rocks, and underbrush. Dicky wishes they could go on a picnic there.
The children notice a series of poles in the distance, connected by fish-nets, and Maida explains that it is a fish weir. She tells them that the tide is going out and they have a limited amount of time to explore the weir before the tide comes back in. Floribel decides to stay on the beach with the Little Six while Zeke accompanies the Big Six.
The group gets into their bathing suits and starts towards the weir. They splash around in the water, chatting and laughing. They reach the weir and Zeke shows them the entrance. He explains that it is a deep-sea trap for fish and that the fish enter through the narrow opening into a channel which leads into the big inner maze. The fish are caught there as the tide retreats and stay there until the fisherman arrives with his cart to shovel them into it.
