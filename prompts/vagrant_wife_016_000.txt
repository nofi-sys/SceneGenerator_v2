-Annie: a timid lily turned flaunting dahlia; charming woman; George's love interest
-George: Sentimental; in love with Annie
-Harry: Annie's husband; a great, senseless brute; dog-in-the-manger; kind to animals; would be happier on a desert island
-Mrs. Stanley: housekeeper; brings Harry a spirit-decanter
-William: Annie's pupil; very tactful

Harry is angry with Annie for spending time with William, but she manages to calm him down. The next morning, he is in a good mood until he finds her in the library with William. He then becomes cross and demands a lesson from her.

The purpose of this scene is to show the contrast between Annie's two husbands - her first husband, George, who is kind and understanding, and her second husband, Harry, who is childish and difficult to deal with.
