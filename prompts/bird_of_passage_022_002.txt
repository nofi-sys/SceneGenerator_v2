Mrs. Durand is a popular person at Port Blair. She is thirty, with a full figure, dark eyes, good features, and white teeth. She is wearing a hat with a dark blue veil, a pretty cambric dress, and carrying a red parasol.
Dr. Malone greets her and they make small talk. Mr. Quentin moves forward to talk to her, and as he does, she sees Gilbert Lisle. She is surprised and delighted to see him, and they shake hands.
Mrs. Durand asks him what he is doing at Port Blair, and he tells her he wanted to see something out of the common and to enlarge his ideas. She is surprised that he has been there for five months, and he explains that he likes the unconventional life and the temporary escape from the mundane.
She tells him that she is in the Opposition and is one of the "reds." They laugh and she says she must go. As she does, she tells him to remember that she expects to see him often.
Mr. Lisle walks with her to the end of the pier and they appear to be speaking earnestly. At the gate, they say goodbye and she waves to him twice.

The style of this scene is light and conversational, with a bit of humor. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is friendly and gossipy.
