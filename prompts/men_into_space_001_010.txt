The style of this scene is very technical and matter-of-fact. The narrator is describing the events as they happen, without any emotional embellishment.

1. McCauley: the protagonist, a skilled astronaut and engineer
2. Furness: McCauley's co-pilot, injured in the crash landing
3. the crew of the X-21: not described in detail, but presumably skilled astronauts as well

McCauley and Furness are on their way back to Earth after a mission to the Samoan Islands. They are running low on fuel, so McCauley prepares to make a risky landing. He uses a rocket-powered dive into the atmosphere to slow the ship down, then bleeds out all the remaining nitric acid. He jettisons the hydrazine and waits five hundred miles before diving into the atmosphere again. The ship bounces out of the atmosphere and eventually lands in the Atlantic Ocean.
