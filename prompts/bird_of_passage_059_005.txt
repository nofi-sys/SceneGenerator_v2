The style of this scene is light and romantic. The tone is playful and flirtatious, and the point of view is third person limited.

- Gilbert and Helen are talking on her doorstep when they are interrupted by Judy, the "Fancy."
- Judy makes a romantic appeal for money, and Gilbert throws her the sovereign that Helen had returned.
- Judy accompanies the lovers to the gates, overwhelming them with shrill benedictions.
- Helen's cousins are sitting with the drawing-room door open, eagerly listening to every sound.
- Helen runs up the gravel and steps, and her cousins question her about her whereabouts.
- Barry, who was sitting with his feet on a chair and a paper in his hand, indifferently asks if she saw Dillon.
