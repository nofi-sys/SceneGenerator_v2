He threatens Mr. Butterell, vowing to kill him if he ever tries to hurt him again. This sets the stage for the rest of the story, which will likely be a battle of wills between these two characters.

The style of this scene is harsh and angry. The narrator is speaking in the first person, and the tone is one of frustration and rage. The point of view is limited, as we only see and hear what the narrator does. There is also a lot of dialogue, which gives the scene a feeling of immediacy.
