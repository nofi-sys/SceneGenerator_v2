Julie is trying to help Miss Fogg, an old woman who is living in a boarding house. Mrs. Watkins, another boarder, tells Julie that she is doubtful that Miss Fogg's niece exists, and that the photograph on the mantel is likely of someone Miss Fogg used to sew for. Julie is distressed at this news, as Miss Fogg has no one else in the world.

- Miss Fogg: an old woman who is cranky and suspicious
- Julie: Miss Fogg's caretaker, who is trying to improve her condition
- Mrs. Watkins: a woman who is rocking a baby and fanning herself
- the baby: sleeping in Mrs. Watkins' arms

The purpose of this scene is to establish the close bond between Julie and Miss Fogg, and to show how Julie is trying to help Miss Fogg find happiness in her life.
