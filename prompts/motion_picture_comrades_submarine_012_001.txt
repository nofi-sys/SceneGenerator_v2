The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Captain Shooks and the pirates, and to show how the former is prepared to defend his treasure-hunting operation. The author also introduces the idea of Oscar going down in a diving suit, which will be important later on.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing exposition on the characters' thoughts and motivations. There is a bit of tension created by the presence of the pirates, but overall the tone is fairly calm.

The captain of the Argonaut tells the three prisoners that they will be staying in the dark cargo hold and gives them a hand torch to use. He then goes back up to the float where the two divers are. One of the divers comes up and the other goes down. The one who goes down signals to the ones on the float and they start pulling up a sack. Inside the sack are three dull-looking bars. The captain comes back up and is angry that they have found the treasure. He orders the three prisoners to follow him below and watches them closely. He comes back up later and tells the boys that they will have to work hard and someone will have to stand guard.
