-Julie: a young woman who is nervous and easily scared
-Mrs. Dolly Anderson: a plump, older woman who is bossy and knows what she wants
-the chimney swallow: a small, blind, and naked bird that is stranded in the fireplace

The style of this scene is conversational and matter-of-fact. There is a hint of suspense or tension in the way Julie is described as being "nervously" and "stiffly" frozen with terror, but it is quickly relieved by the reveal that the source of the noise is simply a baby bird. The tone is lightened further by the banter between Julie and Mrs. Anderson.

It is evening, and Julie is getting ready to go to a prayer meeting. She is in her shop, making sure everything is in order and locked up, when she hears a noise coming from the old, disused fireplace. She knows immediately that it is a chimney swallow, and her first reaction is one of terror. However, she quickly realizes that the bird is just a fledgling and feels compassion for it. She is trying to decide what to do with it when Mrs. Dolly Anderson, a neighbor, comes in and startles her. Mrs. Anderson is on her way to the prayer meeting as well, and is eager to know what has scared Julie. When Julie tells her about the chimney swallow, Mrs. Anderson is quick to say that the only thing to do is to let the cat catch it. Julie is horrified at the idea, but Mrs. Anderson is insistent. She calls the cat, and it comes running in. Julie begs her not to let it catch the bird, but Mrs. Anderson does not listen. The cat catches the bird and kills it.
