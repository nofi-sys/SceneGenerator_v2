Mr. Walcheren is at a ball, hoping to sneak away to meet Jenny Crampton in the picture gallery. He is discovered by Mr. Hindes, who is also friends with the Cramptons. Mr. Hindes tells Mr. Walcheren that he is wasting his time pursuing Jenny, as she is already spoken for.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two characters, and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. The author achieves this by having the two characters meet in an unexpected place, and by having one character reveal his true intentions to the other.
