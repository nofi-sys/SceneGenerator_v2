The purpose of this scene is to introduce the conflict between the protagonist and his father, and to establish the protagonist's character. The author achieves this by having the protagonist's father question him about his love life and his ambitions.

A servant of Madame d'Ionis arrives in the night to deliver a letter to the protagonist. The letter says that M. d'Ionis has died and the protagonist is released from their engagement. The protagonist's father is pleased, as the death means they will win their court case. The protagonist reflects on how this turn of events means they are no longer in love with Madame d'Ionis.

The style of this scene is conversational, with a hint of humor. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is lighthearted.
