The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator describing the action. There is a bit of tension and suspense built up as the reader wonders whether Dud will be able to keep up his winning streak, but overall the tone is fairly light and humorous.

- Bases are loaded with one out in the bottom of the ninth inning, and the Grafton team is down by two runs.
- Guy Murtha explains the situation to Dud, who is tired but eager.
- Dud pitches three balls, all of which are strikes, and the batter is called out.
- The next batter hits a weak grounder, which Jimmy Logan fields and throws to first for the third out.
- Mount Morris goes scoreless in the top of the ninth, and Grafton wins the game.
