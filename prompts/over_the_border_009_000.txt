The literary style of this scene is characterized by its tense, suspenseful tone. The point of view is from the perspective of the husband, who is watching Jim (or the unconscious Jack) save their lives. There is a sense of urgency and danger throughout the scene, as the ship is in danger of hitting a sandbar. The style is also direct and straightforward, without any superfluous description or detail.

- Second mate reports that something hit Jack on the head, who is now just stunned and lying on the deck. 
- Jim, Jack's son who is also on board, suddenly appears on top of the house (of the ship) and starts giving orders in a voice that sounds just like Jack's. 
- Everyone is surprised but follows Jim's orders anyway, and he successfully steers the ship away from danger. 
- Jim has no experience as a sailor, but he is able to save the ship and everyone on board.
