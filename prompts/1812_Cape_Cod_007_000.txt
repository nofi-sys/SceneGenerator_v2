The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted, befitting a meeting of town fathers. The tone is serious, as the men discuss the dire news of the capture of two of their own. There is a sense of foreboding and despair, as the men realize the gravity of the situation and the likelihood that the captives will be sent to England for imprisonment.
