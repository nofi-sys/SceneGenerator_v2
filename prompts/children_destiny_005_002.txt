The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Skelton and old Tom, and to set up the conflict between them. Skelton is presented as a man of the world, who is indifferent to his wealth and status. Old Tom is presented as a keen-eyed man, who is interested in the affairs of the world. The conflict between them is established by old Tom's insistence that Skelton do something better with his life, and Skelton's response that he hopes to do so someday.

1. Skelton: a calm, easy-going man, in his early thirties. He has olive skin, clear-cut features, and brown, sinewy hands. He is the owner of a large estate, and is tutor to Lewis Pryor.
2. Old Tom: a keen-eyed man in his seventies. He is the former tutor of Skelton, and is now retired. He is visiting Skelton at his estate.
3. Lewis Pryor: a young boy, around ten years old. He is the son of an old friend of Skelton and Old Tom. He has a little property, and is being educated by Skelton.
4. Bulstrode: a Cambridge man in his early thirties. He is considered a genius, but is a vulgarian. He is tutor to Lewis Pryor, and is in charge of Skelton's library.

Skelton and old Tom are sitting in the library discussing the latter's guardianship of the former. Skelton is ungrateful and old Tom is angry, but they soon move on to other topics. They discuss the county and Skelton's plans for the future. Skelton is rude and dismissive of old Tom's concerns.
