The style of this scene is very scientific and clinical. The narrator is detached and objective, and the language is precise. There is a sense of foreboding and menace throughout.

-West: the protagonist, a human from Earth who is part of a commission sent to Pluto. He is trying to make sense of the strange things he's seen and heard since arriving.
-The monstrosity: a small, slimy creature that infests West's room on Pluto. It has a long tail and chitters constantly.

West is sitting on the edge of his bed, thinking about the recent events that have transpired. He knows he was lucky to get away before anyone could ask more questions. He's sure he's answered the questions asked of him so far without arousing too much suspicion, but he knows that the longer this goes on, the more likely it is that he'll make a mistake.
Suddenly, one of the small monstrosities that infest the place climbs up the bedpost and onto the bed. West looks at it in disgust and shudders, wondering if it is making a face at him or if it really looks that way.
He remembers that he has heard of these creatures before and has even seen pictures of them, but he can't remember where or when. He knows they are not from Earth.
He starts to think about the situation on Pluto and how nothing seems to make sense. He can't figure out why Stella was sent to Earth or why the government is so pleased with her. He wonders if the government suspects something is going on.
He thinks about the hormone business and how hormones can do funny things to people. He remembers that he is a mutant himself and knows that it is getting harder and harder to be different without being detected.
He starts to think about the possibility of controlled mutations and how the government might be interested in developing hormones that could mutate the human race. He wonders if the members of the commission might have tried the hormone on themselves.
Suddenly, the little monstrosity on the bedpost slobbers gleefully.
