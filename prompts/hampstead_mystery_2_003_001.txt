Henry Hindes wakes up feeling better than he has in a while, attributing his previous night's unease to nerves and fatigue. He goes about his morning routine, preparing for his day, and his wife comments on how much better he looks. 
Later, at his office, Hindes is visited by his business partner, Mr. Crampton, who is on his way to see his solicitor. Crampton is grieving the loss of his daughter, who died recently under suspicious circumstances. Hindes tries to dissuade Crampton from taking legal action, but Crampton is adamant. 
As Crampton leaves, the office clerk, Davidson, comments on how much Crampton has changed since his daughter's death - he looks like a shadow of his former self. This conversation unsettles Hindes, and he is further disturbed when an old friend, Colonel Brinsley, comes to visit him. Brinsley tells Hindes that he ran into Crampton earlier and was shocked by his appearance. 
Hindes is now deeply worried about Crampton and his state of mind. He decides to go and see Crampton that evening before he leaves for Scotland, in the hopes of dissuading him from taking any legal action.
