The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the prosecutor, who wants to make an example of the ringleader, and the defense, which wants to get the best deal possible for all the defendants.

In the scene, Roswell is trying to convince the boys to plead guilty in order to save themselves from execution. He argues that if they do not, they will be found guilty and hanged. The boys are reluctant, but eventually agree to the plan. Roswell then goes to Haight to try to get him to agree to the same deal for McCoy, but Haight is adamant that McCoy must be hanged.
