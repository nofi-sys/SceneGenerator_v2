-The young man: recently revived from a near-death experience, he is now healthy and full of courage. He tells the Professor that he will not continue working for him unless he is paid a fair wage.
-The Professor: a Spiritual Professor who has been running a water-cure establishment. He is taken aback when the young man demands payment for his work.
-The women disciples: long double lines of gaping women who have followed the Professor's every move. They are spellbound by him.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the true nature of the Professor, and to show how the young mathematician has been taken advantage of. The author achieves this by having the Professor offer a large sum of money for the manuscript, which the young man then uses to his own advantage.

The scene opens with the young mathematician telling the Spiritual Professor that unless he is given enough money to support himself, he will not continue working on the complicated calculations the Professor has been engaged in. The Professor resists at first, but when the young man threatens to destroy the manuscript, the Professor agrees to give him five dollars a week. The young man takes the money and leaves, warning the Professor that if he tries to approach him, he will destroy the manuscript. The Professor is left alone, muttering to himself in disbelief that he has been robbed.
