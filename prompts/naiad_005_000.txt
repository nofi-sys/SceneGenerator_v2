The scene opens with the protagonist, M. Just Nivires, returning to the chateau where he had previously spent a few days. He is accompanied by Bernard, but Nivires orders him to go ahead to the chateau while he takes a moment to reflect on the emotions he is feeling.
Nivires then enters the chateau and is immediately struck by the change in atmosphere from when he was last there. The ground is covered in snow and the sun is setting, creating a melancholy mood. Nivires remembers the chateau from when it was full of flowers and verdure and is now struck by its grandeur.
As he walks through the chateau, he comes across the rotunda of the library which has been turned into a sort of hothouse. The fountain is still flowing and the exotic plants are even more beautiful than before. Nivires is then drawn to the statue of the Naiad, which he finds less beautiful than the memory he has of the woman it resembles. However, he gradually begins to appreciate the statue and starts to cry, overwhelmed with emotion.
The sound of a silken robe causes Nivires to look up and he sees a tall, slender woman before him. He is momentarily confused, thinking she is the woman from his vision, but he quickly realizes she is not. The woman introduces herself as Flicie d'Aillane, Bernard's sister.
Flicie is surprised to find Nivires crying and asks if he is okay. Nivires explains that he was just overwhelmed with emotion at being back in the chateau. Flicie then tells him that Bernard is on his way and will be arriving soon.
The scene ends with Nivires and Flicie chatting and getting to know each other better. Nivires is surprised that Bernard never mentioned his sister and Flicie is equally surprised that Nivires is here alone.

The literary style of this scene is formal and polite. The tone is one of sadness and nostalgia, and the point of view is first person.
