-Rob: a young boy, full of pride
-Cameron: a cunning man, leading Rob
-Ephraim Macaulay: a schoolmaster from Inverness, captured by Cameron and Rob

Rob and Cameron have just captured Ephraim Macaulay, a schoolmaster from Inverness, and are discussing what to do with him. Cameron decides to blindfold Macaulay and leave him in the hollow where they found him. He then enlists Rob's help in hiding the treasure they have been digging up, telling him to roll the barrels of treasure down to the stream and hide them in the shadows.
As they are working, Cameron tells Rob that he knows Macaulay was sent by someone to spy on them, and he is interested to find out who that is. He instructs Rob to follow Macaulay when he is released and see which way he goes, then to come back and tell him so that he can send Rob on a journey east.
Rob is hesitant, as he is worried that Lord Lovat will need him, but Cameron assures him that he will take care of everything. They finish hiding the treasure and go their separate ways.

The literary style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of drama or suspense, and the tone is almost conversational. The point of view is limited to Rob's perspective, and we only know what he knows.
