Mark Cramer goes to visit Mrs. McCleary to talk to her about her daughter Esther. He tells her that he is concerned about Esther's welfare and that he believes that Professor Russell is forcing her to meet him in the fields at night. Mrs. McCleary is angry and denies that Professor Russell would ever do anything to harm her daughter.
