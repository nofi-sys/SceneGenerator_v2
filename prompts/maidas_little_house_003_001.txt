The literary style of this scene is very simple and straightforward. There is no fancy language or poetic descriptions. Instead, the author just tells us what we need to know about the setting and the characters.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the setting of the story and to establish the characters' personalities and relationships. The author achieves this by having the characters explore their new surroundings and interact with each other.

The scene is set in a library, where Maida proudly shows off the collection to her guests. The guests are two boys who are excited to sleep in the barn. Maida then shows them the girls' rooms upstairs in the house. The girls' room is simple but quaint, with a big double bed, an old-fashioned bureau, and a desk. There is also a little slat-backed chair in front of the desk and a little slat-backed rocker by one of the windows. In front of the rocker is a cricket as though just ready for little feet. The flowered wall-paper matches the chintz curtains and the chintz ruffles on the little cricket. Under the window, in a little old-fashioned child's chair, sits a great rag doll, and beside her is a little hair-cloth trunk.
