The style of this scene is very dramatic. The point of view is from Julian, who is looking down at the city of Laythe from a distance. The tone is one of horror and despair, as Julian witnesses the massacre of the Laytheans.

-Nah-ee-lah: the Empress of Laythe, in love with Julian.
-Julian: an Earthman, in love with Nah-ee-lah.
-Orthis: a Kalkar, Nah-ee-lah's ex-fianc√©, seeking revenge.
-Jemadars guard: the loyal guard of the Empress of Laythe.
-Kalkars: the invaders of Laythe.

Orthis, the leader of the Kalkars, has arrived at the palace of Laythe to claim Nah-ee-lah as his bride and take revenge on Julian. The Kalkars have already massacred most of the inhabitants of Laythe, and Orthis has just destroyed the last line of defense, the palace gates.
Nah-ee-lah and Julian escape on the wings of Laythe, vowing to find Julian's companions from _The Barsoom_ and die far from the eyes of Orthis.
