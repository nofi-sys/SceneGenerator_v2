George and Harry Braithwaite leave the dining room after their mother and sister and the little governess, Miss Lane. George goes out the door while Harry goes out the French window. They enter the drawing room at the same time. George asks if anyone has seen his cigar case while Harry asks where Miss Lane is. Their mother and sister say that the child has taken her off somewhere to play. Harry leaves the room and searches for Miss Lane. He hears laughter and excited cries coming from upstairs and follows the noise to the picture gallery. He peeks through the curtain into the long, half-lit gallery and sees Miss Lane playing with the child.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the two main characters, George and Miss Lane. We learn that George is a bit of a womanizer, and that Miss Lane is new to the world of governessing. This scene also sets up the conflict between George and Harry, which will be a major plot point later on.
