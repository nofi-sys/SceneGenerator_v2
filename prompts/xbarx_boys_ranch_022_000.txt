Teddy and Roy take shelter from a storm in an abandoned cabin and find seven rifles and a pile of strange objects in the corner.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with simple descriptions of the cabin and its contents. However, the author does use some literary devices to create a sense of suspense and mystery. For example, the boys' reactions to finding the cabin are carefully described in order to create a sense of foreboding. Additionally, the author uses short, choppy sentences to convey a sense of urgency.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the setting and to establish the conflict. The conflict is established by the fact that the boys are stranded in a storm with no shelter. The author also establishes the setting by describing the cabin and the surrounding area.
