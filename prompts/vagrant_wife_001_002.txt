The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two main characters, Miss Lane and George. The author also uses this scene to establish the setting and tone of the story.

-The grave, sedate, prematurely old governess of half an hour before: This character is described as being very serious and mature, despite her young age. She is also said to be quite funny and lively when playing games.
- William: William is said to be quite clumsy, but is also quick of eye and hand.
- Harry: Harry is described as being very passionate and admiring, and is said to be quite captivated by the governess.
- Miss Lane: Miss Lane is said to be very graceful, quick, and excited. She is also said to be quite mischievous.

The scene takes place at a grave, where the governess from before is playing shuttlecock with William. They are laughing and having a good time, when Harry, who has been watching them secretly, comes out from his hiding place. He invites the governess to play billiards with him, but she declines, saying she must go back to the Vicarage. George, who has also been watching them, comes out from his hiding place and teases the governess about her hurry to leave. She says she's happy but must go because she forgot it's the day of her confirmation. George smiles and tells her Betty, her pupil, probably wishes she could spend her evening the same way. The governess agrees.
