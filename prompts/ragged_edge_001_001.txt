- OHara, Bridget, and Ellen are discussing old Jimmie Larkin and the bell that just rang for Mass.
- Bridget and Ellen notice that OHara is in a stormy mood, and try to soothe him.
- The milkman arrives and tells them about old man Murphy dying.
- OHara is convinced that Murphy's grandson will not get any of his money.
- Bridget and Ellen argue that maybe Murphy will call his grandson in now that he's dying.
- OHara is adamant that Murphy will not call his grandson in, and that he will leave his money to the Church or Mary Carroll.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of OHara and to provide some background information on the conflict between him and his son, Martin. We learn that OHara is a bitter, angry man who is not likely to leave his money to anyone, let alone his own son. This sets the stage for the rest of the story.
