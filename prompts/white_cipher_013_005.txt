The literary style of this scene is very formal and matter-of-fact. There is a lot of dialogue, and it is all very straightforward. There is a hint of tension between the characters, but it is not overtly expressed.

- MacKeenon steps between the girl and Fay, handcuffs in hand
- Fay describes the glasses to Sir Richard
- Sir Richard deduces that there must be a connection between the two pairs of glasses
- Fay realizes that Sir Richard is the keenest ferret in all of Europe
- Sir Richard is balked, but only temporarily
- The chief has caught the thin wedge between the two pairs of smoked-glasses
- Fay knows that the hounds are snarling over another trifle

The purpose of this scene is to establish the connection between the two pairs of glasses, and to suggest that the person who wore the glasses with the smoked lenses may have been involved in the cipher that is being investigated.
