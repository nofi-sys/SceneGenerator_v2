The style of this scene is very formal and polite. There is a lot of dialogue between the characters, and it is all very well-mannered. The tone is also quite serious, as the characters are discussing Pauline's singing voice.

The scene takes place in a music studio, where Pauline is singing for Torialli and his wife. Torialli is impressed with Jean's playing and tells his wife to arrange for him to play for them again. Pauline is pleased that she sang well.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Pauline and Jean, and to set up the conflict between them. The author achieves this by showing the different ways in which they react to the praise of Torialli. Pauline is eager to impress the Toriallis and to make them feel that they have made a mistake in passing her over for Hester Lvi. Jean, on the other hand, is more interested in pleasing Gabrielle, the "lover of music." This difference in motivation will create tension between the two characters and drive the plot forward.
