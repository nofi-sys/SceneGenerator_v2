The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person narrator relaying the conversation between Hoppy Mayo and Lieutenant Fotheringay. However, the author does use some flowery language, especially when describing Hoppy's thoughts and feelings.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Hoppy Mayo and to set up the conflict that he will face throughout the story. The author achieves this by having Hoppy reflect on his situation and by having Fotheringay explain the situation to him.

Hoppy Mayo agrees to help the British survey the Massachusetts coastline, despite knowing that it is considered treasonous. He hopes to find a way to help the Americans win the war. His plan is risky, but he is determined to try.
