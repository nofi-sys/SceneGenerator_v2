- Jean: shy but not awkward, embarrassed but not clumsy, with an ineradicable ease of race
- Madame DUcelles: bedizened, exposed, and highly coloured, trying to appear as light as she can
- Romains friend: one of the group around Madame DUcelles, says she is a dear old cow
- Miss Vanderpool: a magnificent young woman, takes instant possession of Jean, with a flicker of her stony, flat, grey eyes

- Jean is introduced to his Aunt Marie, who is very critical of him
- Jean meets Pauline Vanderpool, who is very American and very direct
- Jean and Pauline have a conversation about his Aunt Marie
- Jean is uncomfortable and does not know what to say

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Madame DUcelles and her nephew, Jean. The author achieves this by describing their appearance and mannerisms in detail. Jean is shown to be shy and awkward, while Madame DUcelles is shown to be haughty and scornful. This contrast between the two characters sets the stage for the conflict that will unfold throughout the rest of the story.
