-Mr. Wylie: Mrs. Wylie's husband who is interested in spiritism.
-Dr. Lyman: A speaker at the Lyceum who is talking about spiritism.

Mrs. Wylie and Mrs. Lucien discuss the latter's interest in spiritism and the former's skepticism. Mrs. Wylie recounts an experience of her own which she cannot explain except by admitting to a psychic power beyond her understanding.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters' beliefs about spiritism and the afterlife. Mrs. Wylie is skeptical about the whole idea of spiritism, while Mrs. Lucien is more open to the possibility that it could be real. This difference in opinion between the two women will be important later on in the story.
