The purpose of this scene is to reveal the true nature of Jeannette to the reader, and to establish her as the villain of the story. The author achieves this by having Jeannette say and do things that are designed to make her seem selfish, ungrateful, and cruel.

1. Jeannette: dark-eyed, sharp-tongued, selfish, ungrateful, caustic, haughty, and of refined intellect
2. Marie: fearful, ague-ridden with rage, hideously disfigured, cold, and calculating
3. Edmond: victim of Jeannette's schemes, despairing, and reduced in social status
4. Madame Jeannette: a banditti chieftainess in sentiment, of stout symmetrical figure, imperious bearing, and coarse features
5. Eugenie: proud, haughty, and still in love with Edmond

- Jeannette is a woman of refined intellect and lofty pride who aspires to be a sort of banditti chieftainess in sentiment.

- Eugenie is shocked and tells Marie that she still loves Edmond.
