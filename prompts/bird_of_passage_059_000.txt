Gilbert Lisle meets Helen Denis at the gate separating their two estates. He looks pale and grave, and tells her that he is glad to see her again. Helen is cold and distant, telling him that the past is past and that they should forget they ever met. Lisle insists that she listen to him, and grabs her wrist when she tries to walk away. He eventually releases her, but appeals to her sense of justice to hear him out.
