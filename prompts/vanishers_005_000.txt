The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator. However, there is a bit of tension and suspense created by the fact that the reader knows more than the characters do about the situation they're in. This is particularly true when Matzuku is trying to figure out where they are and how they got there.

A group of Japanese soldiers surrenders to a marine patrol on what they believe to be the island of Guam. However, the marines are just as surprised as the Japanese when they find themselves in the middle of the Kalahari Desert. It is soon revealed that they are all prisoners of an invisible energy dome.
