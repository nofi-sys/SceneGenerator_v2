- Tibby Waring had become an important element in Mr. Wylieâ€™s household
- Every one liked her, from Robbie, who was restless and uneasy in her absence, to Grandma Wylie
- Mrs. Wylie introduced her as a foster-daughter when traveling to save her from any affronts
- Alice Cramer was never weary of watching both Tibby and her sister-in-law
- Mrs. Wylie herself was like a wild bird set at liberty
- She became alarmed at the peculiarities which she observed in Alice

The purpose of this scene is to establish Tibby Waring as a remarkable young woman with a special ability to tame wild horses. The author also uses the scene to establish Mrs. Wylie's high opinion of Tibby and to contrast Tibby's liveliness with Alice Cramer's more subdued demeanor.

The style of this scene is light and conversational. There is a sense of humor and playfulness in the way the characters interact with each other. There is also a sense of mystery and suspense in the way Mrs. Wylie reacts to Alice.
