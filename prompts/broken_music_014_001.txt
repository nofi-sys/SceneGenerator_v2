Romain is in a cab with a lady, and he is telling her about how he tipped a man who laughed like his brother Alphonse. The lady tells him he is too generous to everyone but her, and the conversation turns to other topics.
It is a wet night, and Jean, Romain's nephew, is cold. He is thinking about his meeting with his uncle the night before and how strange it was.
The next morning, Jean wakes up to find Margot, his girlfriend, bending over him. He asks her what is wrong, and she tells him he fainted and she heard him fall. He agrees to stay in and rest for the day.
Margot calls in a doctor, who tells her that Jean has a bad cold and a spot on his lung, but he is young and with Margot's help he should recover. Margot spends the next few days and weeks taking care of Jean and doing everything the doctor says.
The only thing Jean wants that Margot can't give him is Liane. He cries for her over and over, and Margot tries to get her for him. When she can't, she does everything she can to make Jean comfortable.
Eventually, Jean recovers and the doctor tells Margot that she did a great job.

The style of this scene is very dramatic. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is very intense. The author uses a lot of detail to describe the characters and the setting.
