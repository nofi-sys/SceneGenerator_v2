The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two groups of children and to set up the plot for the rest of the story. The author achieves this by having the two groups argue with each other and by having one of the characters make a threat.

- The red car stopped before it completely overturned, and when the exhaust was shut off, the screams of the two girls in the back seat could be heard.
- Montmorency Shannon had leaped from the phaeton and had seized the pony by the bit.
- The little animal stood shaking and pawing, nothing but the shafts and whiffle-tree remaining attached to it by the harness.
- The rear wheels of the racing car were entangled in the phaeton and it was slewed across the road.
- One of the girls in the car was saying, over and over, "Now see what you've done! Now see what you've done!"
- The driver of the red car complained, "I don't see how you came to be standing just there. You might have been on the other side of the drive."
- Monty Shannon declared, "If I'd been headed the wrong way you'd have smashed the pony instead of the carriage."
- Jessie Norwood put in quietly, "There are three of us here who saw the collision, and we can testify to the truth."
- Henrietta added, "Don't forget that Spotted Snake, the Witch, seen it all. If you big girls tell stories about Monty and that pony, you'll wish you hadn't--now you see!"
- At this statement Monty Shannon burst out laughing.
- The red-haired boy could not be long of serious mind.
- Monty Shannon said to the driver of the red car, "Never mind; we ain't killed. And your father can pay Cabbage-head Tony all right. It won't break him."
- Belle Ringold, who was a very proud and unpleasant girl, exclaimed, "You impudent thing! You are always making trouble for people, Montmorency Shannon."
- Henrietta, dancing up and down in her excitement, said, "It was me--Spotted Snake! I brought down the curse of bad weather on your old picnic--the witch's curse. I'm the one that brought thunder and lightning and rain to spoil your fun. And I'll do it again."
- Jessie could not silence her.
- Sally Moon burst into a scornful laugh, but her chum, Belle, said, fanning herself as she sat in the stalled car: "Don't give them any attention. These Roselawn girls are just as low as the Dogtown kids. Thank goodness, Sally, we will get away from them all for the rest of the summer."
