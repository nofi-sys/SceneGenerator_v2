The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two groups of children and to set up the plot for the rest of the story. The author achieves this by having the two groups argue with each other and by having one of the characters make a threat.

Montmorency Shannon had leaped from the phaeton and seized the pony by the bit, preventing it from running away. The red car stopped before it completely overturned, and when the exhaust was shut off, the screams of the two girls in the back seat could be heard. The driver of the red car complained, "I don't see how you came to be standing just there. You might have been on the other side of the drive." Monty Shannon declared, "If I'd been headed the wrong way you'd have smashed the pony instead of the carriage."

One of the girls in the red car, Belle Ringold, was very proud and unpleasant. She exclaimed, "You impudent thing! You are always making trouble for people, Montmorency Shannon." Henrietta, who was very excited, said, "It was me--Spotted Snake! I brought down the curse of bad weather on your old picnic--the witch's curse. I'm the one that brought thunder and lightning and rain to spoil your fun. And I'll do it again."

At this, Monty Shannon burst out laughing. Jessie Norwood put in quietly, "There are three of us here who saw the collision, and we can testify to the truth." The other girl in the red car, Sally Moon, burst into a scornful laugh, but her chum, Belle, said, fanning herself as she sat in the stalled car: "Don't give them any attention. These Roselawn girls are just as low as the Dogtown kids. Thank goodness, Sally, we will get away from them all for the rest of the summer."
