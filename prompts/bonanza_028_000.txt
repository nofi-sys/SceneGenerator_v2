In the scene, Vicky Lowell is in her bedroom at Mrs. Budds, flogging herself with a whip of scorn. She is angry with herself for acting impulsively and recklessly the night before, when she helped Hugh McClintock and Jim Budd fight off a group of gunmen. Mrs. Budd comes to the door to tell Vicky that Hugh is there to see her, and Vicky reluctantly goes downstairs to breakfast. Hugh is grateful to Vicky for her help, and Vicky is relieved that he does not seem to be imagining any foolishness. They discuss plans for getting Dutch to Carson, and Vicky insists on sending for Doctor Rogers to look at Hugh and Jim, who are both exhausted from the night before.
