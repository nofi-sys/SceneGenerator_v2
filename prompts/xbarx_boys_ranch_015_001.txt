Mr. and Mrs. Manley: the cattle owners, watching the scene

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and characters for the story. The author also introduces the conflict in this scene - the girls do not have their party dresses and are worried about what the boys will think.

The scene takes place at the X Bar X ranch, where a group of cowboys are gathered for a dance. Ethel and Teddy are trying to keep a straight face, but they start laughing when Nick says he was just showing the boys how to act tonight. Pop Burns asks Teddy what "mahvis dance" means, and Teddy explains that it means "may I have this dance." Nick is triumphant that he was right, and Ethel tells him to keep explaining to the boys.
As the darkness deepens, Nell and Ethel become worried about their evening dresses. They were supposed to have been delivered by Bug Eye, but he has not arrived yet. Mr. Manley calls the 8 X 8 ranch and is told that Bug Eye left there hours ago. They wait a while longer, but when Bug Eye does not arrive, they decide to go ahead with the dance without the dresses. Ethel and Nell are disappointed, but they make the best of it.
The orchestra starts to tune up and everyone gathers in the living room. Pop Burns has his shoes polished and Gus Tripp is sitting in the seat of honor with his arm in a sling. Rad Sell is wearing a new yellow-striped shirt and Nick Looker has given up his diamond stickpin. Norine is standing in a corner wearing a red dress.
Mr. and Mrs. Manley are watching the scene with happy smiles. They are the parents of children almost grown, but there are no younger people in that room than those two.
