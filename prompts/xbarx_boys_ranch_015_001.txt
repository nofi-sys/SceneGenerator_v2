Ethel and Teddy are two of the visitors at the X Bar X ranch, trying not to laugh at the antics of the cowboy Nick. Nick is trying to teach the other cowboys how to dance, and is very triumphant when he gets something right. However, Ethel and Teddy are soon worried about their evening dresses, which have not arrived. They wait for a while, but when the dresses don't come, they go ahead with the dance without them. Ethel and Nell are disappointed, but they make the best of it. The orchestra starts to tune up and everyone gathers in the living room. Pop Burns has his shoes polished and Gus Tripp is sitting in the seat of honor with his arm in a sling. Rad Sell is wearing a new yellow-striped shirt and Nick Looker has given up his diamond stickpin. Norine is standing in a corner wearing a red dress. Mr. and Mrs. Manley are watching the scene with happy smiles.
