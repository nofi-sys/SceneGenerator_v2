The scene opens with the Watson, a US destroyer, racing through the night at full speed. The only guidance the ship has is a brief and somewhat vague message from another vessel, the Windbird. If the information in the message is correct, the Watson should be able to overtake the Windbird. However, there are many variables that could make the situation more difficult, such as the darkness of the night and the fact that the Windbird may be running without lights.
As the minutes pass, the destroyer closes in on the spot where the Windbird should be. Suddenly, the operator on the Watson receives a message from the Windbird. The message says that the Windbird is being pursued by an armored cruiser from Kaiserland and is close to the Watson.
Topham, the captain of the Watson, orders the searchlight turned on. The light reveals the Windbird, close to the Watson and with its guns manned and ready. Topham orders Quentin, the man operating the megaphone, to hail the Windbird and tell them that he will send a boat over.
The man on the Windbird's bridge, who is revealed to be Ouro Preto, megaphones back an expletive and tells the Watson to go to hell.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is from the perspective of the crew of the Watson, and the tone is one of excitement and urgency.

1. Topham: Captain of the Watson, a US destroyer
2. Quentin: First mate of the Watson
3. The operator: Manning the radio on the Watson
4. The man on the Windbird's bridge: presumably Ouro Preto
