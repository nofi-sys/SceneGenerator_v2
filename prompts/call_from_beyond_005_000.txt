A group of people are sitting around a table in a strange place, discussing the creatures that live there. One of the creatures, a woman with a moth-like face, is brought in and introduced to the group. The woman is telepathic and her singing is influenced by the thoughts of those around her.

The style of this scene is very descriptive, with a lot of detail about the setting and the characters. The tone is somewhat creepy, and the point of view is third person limited.
