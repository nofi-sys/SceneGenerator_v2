The scene opens with Fay and MacKeenon in a car speeding towards London. Fay is elated at his sudden freedom, and MacKeenon is alert for any danger. They discuss the war and Fay's time in prison. As they near Piccadilly, Fay begins to suspect that MacKeenon is taking him to Scotland Yard for interrogation. His suspicions are confirmed when they reach the Thames and the car slows down. Fay is nervous, but he does not squeal or try to escape. He knows that he is facing the unknown, but he is prepared for whatever may come.
