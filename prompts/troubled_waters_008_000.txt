Ruth: the girl wife, newly married to Rowan and living on a frontier ranch. She is fastidious and has a good sense of style.
Rowan: Ruth's husband, a ranchman who is increasingly preoccupied with business. He is tenderly in love with Ruth but reticent about expressing his emotions.
The black-haired stranger: a man who has news for Rowan and is on friendly terms with him. Ruth has seen him twice before and does not like him.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Ruth and her husband Rowan. Ruth is annoyed with Rowan because he has been disappearing for days at a time without explanation, and she is also resentful of his friendship with the young scamp who kissed her in the orchard. This conflict will drive the plot forward as Ruth tries to figure out what is going on with her husband and why he is keeping secrets from her.
