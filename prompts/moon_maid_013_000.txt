Sagroth, the Jemadar of Laythe, is speaking with Ju-lan, a stranger who has recently arrived in Va-nah. He is asking Ju-lan about his world and how he came to be in Va-nah. Ju-lan tells him that he is from the Moon and that he arrived in Va-nah via a ship.
Sagroth is intrigued by this and asks Ju-lan if he believes that their ancestors may have arrived in Va-nah in a similar way. Ju-lan is hesitant at first, but then admits that it is possible. Sagroth goes on to say that he believes their ancestors were from the outer crust of the Moon and that they arrived in Va-nah millions of years ago.
Ju-lan is amazed by this theory and the two continue to chat pleasantly about it for some time. Eventually, Sagroth says that they should join the others at the tables and leads Ju-lan out onto a balcony overlooking the crater. Guards accompany them as they move through the palace.

The style of this scene is formal and polite, befitting a meeting between two high-ranking officials. There is a sense of tension beneath the surface, as the two men discuss potentially controversial topics.

Ju-lan: A stranger in Laythe who has been transported from his home world. He is Javadar and is choosing his own friends.
Ko-tah: A Laythean who is trying to get Ju-lan to choose his friends wisely. He is Javadar and is respectful to Ju-lan.
Sagroth: The Jemadar of Laythe who is talking to Ju-lan about his world and how he got to Va-nah. He is interested in the legends of Ju-lan's world.
