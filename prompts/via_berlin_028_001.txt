Ouro Preto, the yacht's captain, responds with a threat to fire back, but the Seabird's crew is unwilling to engage with a United States ship. Topham orders another shot, which hits the pilot house, and Ouro Preto is forced to abandon ship. Topham boards the Seabird and orders Ouro Preto to surrender the girl. When Ouro Preto refuses, Topham threatens to take him into port as a pirate.
