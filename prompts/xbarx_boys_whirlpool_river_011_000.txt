The scene opens with the four main characters making breakfast and discussing the previous night, during which one of them thought they heard someone sneaking around. They soon set off down the river again, and Pop tells them that if nothing happens, they should reach their destination by nightfall. However, shortly after, it begins to rain heavily, and they are forced to take shelter on shore.
