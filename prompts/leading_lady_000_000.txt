The big man in the scene is Bassett, and he is talking to Anne about the play they are putting on, "Twelfth Night". He is telling her that they have special instructions not to allow anyone on the island where they are performing except for the company. Anne is worried that the people hunting for her friend, Sybil, will find her on the island. Bassett reassures her and tells her that he will protect her if they try to hound her down.
Joe, Anne's brother, comes into the room and tells them that Sybil has a visitor. He is interested in the play and asks if they have found someone to play Sebastian yet. Anne tells him no, and he offers to do it. Bassett is skeptical, but Joe demonstrates his acting skills and Bassett agrees to let him try out for the part.

The literary style of this scene is light and humorous. The tone is playful and there is a lot of banter between the characters. The POV is third person limited.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Joe and to establish his relationship to Anne and Bassett. The author also uses the scene to foreshadow the conflict that will arise later between Joe and Bassett.
