The scene opens with two men, Scot and Hugh McClintock, walking through the crowded streets of Virginia City. They pass a wagon where a woman and child are cooking a stew over a campfire. A man sits on the wagon tongue smoking. The brothers comment on the thinness of the horses and the broomtails. They continue walking and hear a voice from the sidewalk drift to them, saying that there is trouble at the Mile High Saloon. A moment later, they hear the sound of a shot, followed by a second. They see men pouring out of the Mile High Saloon, followed by a single man with a revolver in his hand. The man runs to the shelter of the wagon for safety. A huge fellow, bellowing like a bull, runs out of the saloon in pursuit. The McClintock brothers run back to the wagon. The man on the tongue is disappearing into the bed through the opening in the canvas. The woman and the little girl, terror-stricken, stand spellbound beside the fire. The McClintock brothers crouch above them, shielding them from the danger of wild bullets. They do not see the red-headed man stumble and pitch forward, nor do they see the big ruffian at his heels fling shot after shot into his prostrate form. Hugh releases his weight from the child, and lifts her to her feet in such a way that her face is turned from the tragedy. He tells her to run into the wagon where her dad is and not to turn her head. She moves forward, whimpering as she goes, and climbs to the wagon tongue. But, just as she is about to vanish inside, curiosity or some other impulse swings round her black and shaggy little head. Big dark eyes fasten on Hugh, then move past him to the awful thing she is to see in her dreams for many a night. A man, red-haired and red-bearded, lay face up on the ground, sightless eyes staring up at the blue sky. A second man straddles the body with brutal triumph, a big slouchy fellow with coarse tawny hair reaching to his neck, and sandy whiskers tied under his chin. He wears a brown Peruvian hat, a blue army overcoat with a cape, and a woollen shirt. From his bootleg a horn-handled bowie knife projected. The murderer jeers in a heavy overbearing voice. He shuffles away, Spanish spurs jingling, slouching and slow of movement. His gestures were heavy, except when shooting. No bad man in Washoe was quicker on the draw.
