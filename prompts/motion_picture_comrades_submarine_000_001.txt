The three boys are about to embark on an exciting expedition to salvage sunken treasure-ships with the help of a submarine. They are thrilled at the prospect of using a camera to document the amazing underwater world they are about to explore.

-Oscar: one of the three comrades, a boy who is excited about the expedition
-Ballyhoo: one of the three comrades, a boy who is excited about the expedition
-Jack: one of the three comrades, a boy who is excited about the expedition and is also an enthusiastic artist
-Abner Crawley: an adventurous old man, the uncle of Ballyhoo's mother, who has a third interest in the expedition
-Jules Vernes: author of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, a book that the boys read and are excited about

The style of this scene is adventurous and romantic. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is excited and enthusiastic.
