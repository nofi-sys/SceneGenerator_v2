Aurora is at a ball at the Peterhof, where she is the belle of the ball. She is wearing a stunning gown and jewels and dancing with the Crown Prince. She is approached by the Empress, who introduces her to her cousin, Rudolph, the Grand Duke of Lautenburg-Detmold. He asks her to dance and she accepts, but he is a terrible dancer. She is unimpressed by him and barely speaks to him.
The next day, she hears that there is to be a fox hunt and is excited to ride her horse, Taras-Bulba. She goes to the stable to see him and he is excited to see her.
Later, she is in her room with her father, who tells her that the Grand Duke has asked to marry her. She is uninterested, as he is much older than she is. However, her father tells her that he is the heir to the throne of Wrtemberg and she agrees to marry him.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Aurora and to establish her as a spoiled, self-centered young woman. The author achieves this by having Aurora dismiss the advances of a handsome young man, Rudolph, and by having her focus only on her own appearance and on the material things she possesses.

The style of this scene is light and humorous. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is slightly mocking.
