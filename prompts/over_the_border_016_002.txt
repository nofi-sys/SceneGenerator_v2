The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Tom and his wife, and to set up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story. Tom and his wife are both shown to be intelligent and quick-witted, and they have a good sense of humor. However, they are also shown to be very different in their tastes and interests. Tom is interested in seafaring tales and in the knife that his wife has been reading about, while she is not. This difference will become important later on, as it will lead to Tom becoming obsessed with the knife and with the idea of going to sea, while his wife remains at home.

1. Tom wakes up to find himself on his knees, begging his wife for something. 
2. His wife tells him that he was sleep-talking and she wrote down what he said. 
3. He reads over what she wrote and realizes that it is from a book he was reading earlier. 
4. They both conclude that it must be the book that is affecting them and not just the knife.

The literary style of this scene is light-hearted and humorous. The tone is playful and teasing, and the point of view is third person omniscient.
