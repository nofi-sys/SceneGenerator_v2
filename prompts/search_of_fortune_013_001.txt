The style of this scene is very descriptive. The author uses a lot of detail to describe the setting and the characters' emotions. The tone is also quite sad, as the characters are grieving over the death of the widow.

-The policeman had carried her in, laid her on the bed with a rough sort of kindness, made up the fire, then gone out and thought no more about her. 
-How she had spent the night need hardly be said; it is better imagined. 
-The cold grew more intense as night drew on, and it did its work on the poor widow's weakened frame. 
-The Squire speedily effected Bob Cooper's freedom, and he felt he had really done a good thing. 
-So this was arranged. 
-And now they came in sight of the cottage, and Bob rubbed his eyes and looked again and again, for no smoke came from the chimney, no signs of life was about. 
-When the room had been cleared and swept of snow; when a roaring fire had been built on the hearth, and a little warm tea poured gently down her throat, she came gradually back again to life, and in a short time was able to be lifted into a sitting position, and then she recognized her son and Archie. 
-Archie rode home the giant hunter, but in two hours he was once more mounted on Scallowa, and feathering back through the snow towards the little cottage.

The purpose of this scene is to show the harsh realities of life for poor people in the 1800s. The author achieves this by describing the conditions of the widow's house and her struggles to survive.
