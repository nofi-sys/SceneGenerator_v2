Archie is showing Etheldene around the farm when they come across a herd of cattle. Etheldene is impressed by Archie's knowledge of the animals and they continue to chat as they watch the cattle. Suddenly, a bull breaks away from the herd and starts running towards the forest. Etheldene takes off after it on her horse, with Archie close behind.
