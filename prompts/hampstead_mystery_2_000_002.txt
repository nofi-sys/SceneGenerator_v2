In the scene, the coroner is questioning Frederick Walcheren about the death of his wife, Jenny. The jury has just come back with a verdict that her death was from a fall over the cliffs, but they are not sure if it was an accident or not. The coroner is not satisfied with this and presses Frederick for more information. Frederick is angry and upset, and Philip rushes him out of the room before he can say anything else. They find that Jenny's body has already been moved and is being prepared for burial. Frederick is furious that he wasn't consulted about this.

The style of this scene is dramatic, with a touch of suspense. The reader is not sure what the verdict will be, and the characters are also uncertain. There is a sense of foreboding, as if something bad is about to happen.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the coroner's suspicion of foul play in Jenny's death, and to show Frederick's reaction to being suspected. The author achieves these goals by having the coroner lay out his suspicions in detail and by having Frederick express his shock and anger at being suspected.
