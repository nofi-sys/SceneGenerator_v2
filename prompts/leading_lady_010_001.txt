The author is trying to establish Williams' character and motivations. Williams is trying to figure out if Mrs. Stokes is guilty of murder, and he is also trying to establish whether or not she was lying about her book being on the table.

Mrs. Stokes is the only person out on the island when Miss Saunders is shot. She is too intelligent to make a later entrance and turn suspicion on herself, so she uses her acting skills to pretend she is too excited to think or move. However, Williams is suspicious of her story because she takes too long to return to the house after the shot is fired.

The literary style of this scene is third person limited point of view with a detached, objective tone.
