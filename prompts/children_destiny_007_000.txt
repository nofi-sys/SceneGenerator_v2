The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted, befitting the time period in which it is set. The point of view is third person omniscient.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Sylvia and Lewis. Sylvia is a kind-hearted woman who feels sympathy for Lewis because he is lonely and misunderstood. Lewis is a shy boy who is won over by Sylvia's grace and charm. They become friends, and the scene ends with Sylvia accepting Lewis's invitation to go sailing with him.

Sylvia is troubled, thinking she may have caused Skeleton's defeat by her actions. There is no match between Jaybird and Alabaster that autumn, but Sylvia heartily wishes there was. 
Skelton has not been entertaining at his home since he returned, but he has been seen around Deerchase. Sylvia sees Lewis Pryor often and they become friends. 
Mrs. Shapleigh finds out that Lewis Pryor, not Richard Skelton, sent Sylvia a bouquet of wild flowers. Sylvia writes Lewis a note in response. 
Bulstrode teases Lewis Pryor about the bouquet episode, but Lewis is not to be turned from his liking by teasing. Soon after, Lewis writes a note inviting Sylvia to take a sail in his boat. Sylvia accepts and they spend the day together.
