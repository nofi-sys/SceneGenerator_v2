In the scene, Hugh McClintock pays the editor of the Piodie Banner for an advertisement and for 250 posters to be put up around town. The editor is hesitant, but McClintock is insistent. The notice is for a found Bowie knife with 14 notches.
Later, Sam Dutch, the owner of the knife, comes across the notice and tears it down in a rage. He does this with several more notices before finally stopping at a bar. The bartender tries to make small talk, but Dutch is in a bad mood. The bartender eventually mentions the young man who put up the notices, and Dutch becomes even angrier.
 Dutch is clearly dangerous, and the bartender is relieved when he finally leaves.
