The scene opens with the Manleys and their friends racing across the open range to Sanborns Point, where Bug Eye was held up. Mr. Manley breaks off from the group to circle around and try to cut the thieves off at Hawley. The tire tracks lead the group off to the left, and Teddy gives a yell when he sees that they match the direction his dad went. Jim Casey finds a box at the side of the road, and Bug Eye bends over to examine it.

The style of this scene is fast-paced and action-packed. It is written in third person point of view, with Bug Eye as the focus character. The tone is tense and suspenseful, as the characters are in a race to catch the thieves.
