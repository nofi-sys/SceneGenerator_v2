The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of dark humor. The point of view is third person omniscient, and the tone is one of urgency.

Dusty is riding in a Marandanian spacecraft behind the pilot when he notices the smoothness of the man's operation. He is impressed by the color of the plate and the stars that seem to whip past. The pilot is able to skirt gas fields and zigzag between clusters with ease.
Suddenly, the squawk box on the wall interrupts with a report for Gant Nerley. Dusty is surprised to learn that the Transgalactic government has issued an order for all operations to be discontinued. Gant explains that the law has been changed and the interested parties must be properly notified of the change before it can go into effect.
Dusty is angry that the Transgalactic government is playing communication-silence and not acknowledging the new law. He feels that they are just as guilty as the Marandanian spacecraft that they are trying to stop.
