Colonel Denis and his daughter Helen are having breakfast together and discussing the prisoners on Ross Island. Helen is surprised to learn that some of the prisoners are actually servants. Colonel Denis then tells her about his own experience with his sister-in-law, Aunt Julia.
Aunt Julia was always making snide comments about Helen's appearance and intelligence. One day, while Helen was visiting during her vacation from school, Aunt Julia went too far and Helen threw a cup of scalding tea in her face. Aunt Julia was so enraged that she had Helen's hair cut off close to her neck.
After that incident, Helen was never invited back to visit Aunt Julia again. She is glad that her father is nothing like his sister-in-law.

The literary style of this scene is conversational and light-hearted. The tone is playful and teasing, and the point of view is from Helen's perspective.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the backstory of the protagonist, Helen, and to establish her relationship with her father. The author achieves this by having the characters discuss Helen's history and their current situation.
