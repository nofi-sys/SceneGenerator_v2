The scene opens with Arthur Gordon chatting with the Purser in the Captain's room. They are interrupted by a sailor who has found two stowaways, Tom and Jim, hiding in the hold. The Captain sternly questions the boys and they explain that they are orphans who have been living on the streets. They decided to stow away on the ship to go to Canada in search of a better life. The Captain is moved by their story and decides not to punish them. He gives them a meal and some old clothes. For the rest of the voyage, the boys work to earn their passage. At the end of the voyage, the passengers pool their money to give to the boys as a reward for their hard work.
