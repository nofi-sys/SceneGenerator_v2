The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the characters of John and Corin, and to establish the setting of the story. The author achieves these goals by describing the chaotic scene within the churchyard, and by showing John and Corin's reaction to the discovery of the mural paintings.

The style of this scene is very descriptive. The author uses detailed language to paint a picture of the chaotic churchyard and the workers within it. The tone is one of fascination and wonder, as John admires the ancient paintings that have been uncovered. The point of view is third person limited, as the reader only knows what John sees and thinks.

John walks up to the churchyard and sees the Norman doorway. He hears the sound of workmen inside and pauses to look. He sees the scaffolding and barrows and thinks it will be difficult to make order out of the chaos. He goes in and sees Corin, high up on a platform, working on the east window. John climbs up to the platform and admires the work. Corin explains that they are masonry lines and the flower is the herb Robert. John is impressed. They discuss the possibility of finding more treasures hidden in the plaster and Corin shows John a spot where he has found black chevrons.
