The style of this scene is very descriptive. The author uses a lot of detail to describe the setting and the characters' reactions to it. The tone is also quite dreamy and magical, as if the reader is experiencing the scene along with the characters.

The scene is set at a colonial farmhouse in the middle of a large lawn. The house is surrounded by trees, and there is a pond in the distance. The family arrives in a car and is met by Maida, the daughter of the house. She shows them around the grounds and tells them about the pond, which she calls the "Magic Mirror."
