-Nathan: husband of Lissa, worried about her mental state
-Lissa: mother who lost her child and is now fixated on the idea of seeing it again
-Lucy: the child who died
-Mark Cramer: brother-in-law of Nathan, concerned for Lissas well-being
-Neoka: the domestic who is now responsible for the household since Lissa's decline

Nathan and Lissa's child dies, and Lissa falls into a deep depression. She becomes fixated on the idea of seeing her child again and starts having delusions that she does see her. Nathan becomes increasingly worried about her mental state and health. He talks to Lissa's brother, Mark, about his concerns and Mark agrees that Lissa is likely self-deceived and could become insane if she does not get help. Nathan tries to get Lissa to take an interest in her household again, but she refuses and continues to believe that she sees her dead child.

The style of this scene is sad and anxious. The tone is one of despair, and the point of view is from Nathan's perspective.
