Rob is traveling through the Scottish Highlands and comes across a strange inn. The innkeeper is a sallow, secretive man with a squint, and Rob gets a bad feeling from him. He decides to stay anyway, and falls asleep in the loft. He is woken up in the middle of the night by the innkeeper, who has a group of men with him. The men tie Rob up and rob him, then leave him in the loft. In the morning, the innkeeper pretends nothing happened and tells Rob to leave.

1. Rob: a young man, recently arrived in the south of Scotland from the Highlands. He is seeking employment in Edinburgh.
2. The man with the squint: the innkeeper, a sallow, secretive-looking fellow with a tangled beard and hair. He seems to be hiding something.
3. Muckle John: Rob's companion, a large, burly man from the Highlands.
4. The pedlar: a man Rob met on the road, from whom he bought a suit of old clothes.

The literary style of this scene is one of suspense and fear. The tone is anxious and the point of view is from Rob's perspective. The setting is a remote, isolated inn and the atmosphere is one of foreboding.
