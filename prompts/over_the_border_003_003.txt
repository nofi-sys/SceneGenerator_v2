The purpose of this scene is to establish the author's opinion of George Morton, and to foreshadow the eventual outcome of the story. The author achieves these goals by having the characters discuss the fire, and by having Morton confront the narrator directly.

The scene opens with the protagonist, a ship's officer, speaking to George Morton, a passenger. The officer tells Morton that he does not believe Morton's claim that he did not set fire to the ship's cargo, because Morton is a known arsonist. The conversation turns to the discussion of how the fire started, and the captain and crew decide that the best course of action is to wait it out and hope that the fire will smother itself.
The scene continues with the ship headed towards Calcutta in the hopes of finding a large steamer that can help put out the fire. However, days and weeks go by without any sign of help, and the fire continues to burn. The smoke from the fire becomes visible, and Morton becomes increasingly agitated.
Finally, the protagonist speaks to Morton again, this time telling him that he is sorry for his previous words. The scene ends with the two men speaking kindly to each other.
