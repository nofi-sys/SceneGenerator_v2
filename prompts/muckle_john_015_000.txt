1. The messenger of Muckle John - a strong, silent type
2. Archibald Cameron - short, round, and genial
3. Dr. Cameron's companion - tall, cadaverous, and anxious

The scene opens with the messenger of Muckle John waiting under a rock in northern Lochaber for the dawn. He is watching the track below him for two men who are coming from the south. As they approach, he can see that one is a short, strongly built man with a round, genial countenance and shrewd blue eyes. The other is a tall, cadaverous figure, heavily cloaked and coughing dismally. They are both walking quickly and do not speak to each other.
When they reach the place where the messenger is hiding, he calls out to them. The short man, who is Archibald Cameron, asks what he wants. The messenger replies that he wants to speak to Cameron. The tall man, who is Murray of Broughton, seems anxious and begins to speak to Cameron in a low voice. Cameron cuts him short, however, and tells him to be quiet.
The three men then climb up to the hidden place. It is a small hole in the ground, about six feet by eight and three feet high, which smells like a fox's lair. Cameron and Broughton both seem surprised and disgusted by it.
Cameron asks the messenger what he wants. The messenger tells them that he has no news of the Prince. This seems to upset Broughton, who begins to cough and says that he is like to die. Cameron tries to comfort him, but Broughton is clearly very worried and scared.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the two main characters, Archibald Cameron and Murray of Broughton. The author also establishes the setting and establishes the relationship between the two men.
