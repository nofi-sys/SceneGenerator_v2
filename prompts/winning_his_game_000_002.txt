The style of this scene is conversational and informal. The tone is friendly and helpful, and the point of view is third person limited.

Jimmy and Dud are discussing Dud's shyness and how it prevents him from mixing with other people. Jimmy tells Dud that he needs to stop wondering whether people like him or not, and just get out there and mix. He also advises Dud to be more of a "regular feller" and not try too hard to be popular.
Later, they decide to visit Hugh Ordway, an upper middle class student whom Dud admires. Jimmy reassures Dud that Ordway is just like any other person, except that he happens to be English and come from a wealthy family.
They go to Ordway's room and find him studying. They strike up a conversation, and Ordway seems interested in getting to know Dud better. They exchange stories about their families and interests, and Ordway invites Dud to come visit him in England during the summer. Dud is thrilled, and the two of them become friends.
