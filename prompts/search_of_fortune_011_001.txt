Archie is out hunting and gets lost. He stumbles upon a cottage where a group of poachers are sitting around a table, eating and drinking. They have guns in the corners of the room and seem to be getting ready to go somewhere. Archie quickly backs away and decides to go to the cottage to ask for directions. 
The poachers are startled when Archie walks in, and he quickly realizes that they are up to no good. They threaten him and demand to know why he is there. Archie tells them he is lost and just wants to know how to get back to the main road. The poachers are not convinced and decide to tie him up. 
While the poachers are distracted, Bounder, Archie's dog, manages to untie him. Archie grabs a gun and points it at the poachers, telling them to leave. They are scared and quickly comply. Archie then unties the other hostages and calls the police.
