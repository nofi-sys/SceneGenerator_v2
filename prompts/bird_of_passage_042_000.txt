The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Aunt Julia and to introduce the conflict that Helen will face throughout the story. Aunt Julia is presented as a selfish woman who is more concerned with appearances and her own social status than with the welfare of her niece. Helen, on the other hand, is shown to be a practical and level-headed young woman who is not afraid to speak her mind. This scene sets up the tension that will drive the plot forward.
