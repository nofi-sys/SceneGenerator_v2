The three little girls are in the rose garden, picking flowers. Rosie is in a bad mood, and she and Maida start talking about the gypsy camp they went to. They mention Silva Burle, and Rosie says she hates her. The girls then go inside and start putting the flowers in vases. Arthur comes in and tells them they can go down to the pond to swim. The girls go to their rooms to change into their bathing suits, and then they all head to the pond.
