The scene takes place in a city on the moon, built around a crater. The protagonist is led by his captors to a large building, where he is questioned by a bald, older man. He is then told that he will be held for questioning by The Twentyfour, and that if he attempts to escape, he will be tortured to death.
The protagonist is then taken to a small, dimly-lit room, where he meets another prisoner, a man from Laythe. The two men talk, and the man from Laythe tells the protagonist how he was captured by the Kalkars.
