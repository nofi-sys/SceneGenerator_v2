The scene opens with a woman crying on a man's shoulder. He tries to comfort her, and she tells him that he has only brought her suffering and danger. He insists that he loves her, and she confesses that she has loved him since they were first imprisoned together.
They search the palace for her mother and eventually find her dead in the audience chamber, along with the bodies of the assassins and the Jemadar. Nah-ee-lah is devastated, but they continue on to the upper terrace.
They watch as the city burns and people are massacred by the Kalkars. Nah-ee-lah blames herself for not being able to protect her people. The scene ends with the two of them standing together, watching the destruction.

The style of this scene is very dramatic. The tone is intense and the point of view is from Julian's perspective.
