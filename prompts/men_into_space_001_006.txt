The scene opens with McCauley and Furness discussing the course of the ship and making corrections. They are in orbit around the Earth and McCauley is busy working on the ship's controls. Furness is relaying information from the various gauges and instruments.
After a few minutes, McCauley reports that he is going to make a course correction with a one-second blast from the rockets. He tells Furness the bearing he thinks the ship should be on, and Furness repeats the information to ground control.
After the correction is made, McCauley and Furness continue to work. McCauley checks his work and then takes a moment to look at the Earth below. He sees the vast expanse of ocean and the clouds around the Cape Verde Islands. He also sees Africa, but it is mostly hidden by clouds.
As the ship continues on its course, McCauley sees more of Africa and then the Gulf of Guinea. The ship is heading towards Antarctica.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and situation for the story. The author achieves this by describing the ship and the view from it.

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and technical. The point of view is limited to McCauley's perspective, and the tone is fairly neutral.
