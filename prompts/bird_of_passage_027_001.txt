Mrs. Durand is sitting with Mrs. Graham, who has just regaled her with a story about Mr. Lisle that she has heard from Mrs. Creery. Mrs. Durand is shocked and asks Mrs. Creery to repeat the story. Mrs. Creery obliges, and the story is that Mr. Lisle is a bankrupt and a swindler who has been cashiered from the army for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Mrs. Durand denies the story and says that Mrs. Creery is mistaken. Mrs. Creery insists that she is not mistaken, and the two ladies begin to argue. The other ladies in the room are fascinated by the argument and eagerly await the outcome. Mrs. Durand eventually proves that Mrs. Creery is wrong about Mr. Lisle, and the latter is forced to admit defeat.

The purpose of this scene is to establish conflict between the two main characters, Mrs. Creery and Mrs. Durand. The author achieves this goal by having the two women argue over the character of Mr. Lisle.

The style of this scene is very formal and polite, with a hint of tension and conflict beneath the surface. The dialogue is stiff and formal, and the characters seem to be holding back their true feelings. There is a sense of foreboding, as if something is about to happen.
