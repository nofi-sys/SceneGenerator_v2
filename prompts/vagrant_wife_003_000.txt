The purpose of this scene is to establish a connection between the two characters, and to set up a potential relationship between them. The author achieves this by having the two characters share their personal histories with each other, and by having them express their feelings for each other.

George Braithwaite: A young man who is interested in music and teaching. He is also an orphan.
Miss Lane: A young woman who is also an orphan. She is a music teacher and is planning to move to London.

George asks Miss Lane to promise to give him her address in London if she settles there by herself. Miss Lane is hesitant, but George persists, telling her that he will take her to a concert if she does. Miss Lane agrees, and they exchange addresses.
