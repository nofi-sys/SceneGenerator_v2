Gabriel Harvey, the launchman, did not take Joe Tracy across to the mainland the night he disappeared, as was previously thought. Rawson, investigating Tracy's movements, found Gabriel in a place called White Beach and learned that Tracy had never arrived there. This new information suggests that Tracy's sister, who said she saw him leave, may not be telling the truth.

The literary style of this scene is rather dry and matter-of-fact. There is not much emotion or suspense. The tone is somewhat businesslike, and the point of view is third person omniscient.
