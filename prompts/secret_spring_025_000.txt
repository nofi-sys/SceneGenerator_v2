In 1909, Duke Frederick-Augustus of Lautenburg was embroiled in the Eulenburg affair and the Moltke-Harden case, two scandals that rocked the German Court. Despite his reputation for being a ladies' man, he managed to avoid being implicated in either scandal.
In 1912, Frederick-Augustus married Aurora, the widow of his late brother, Grand Duke Rudolph. The Emperor and Empress were in attendance at the wedding.
During the wedding dinner, a tapping noise was heard coming from the floor above. It continued throughout the meal, much to the annoyance of the guests. Frederick-Augustus explained that it was just the wind, but Aurora knew better. She knew that it was the ghost of her first husband, Rudolph, tapping out a warning to her.
