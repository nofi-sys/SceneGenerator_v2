Donald is worried about Tibby, who has gone out riding in spite of the impending storm. He sets out to find her, and when he arrives at her destination, he finds that she has not yet arrived. He decides to go and meet her, and when he finds her, she is laughing and carefree. However, the storm is getting worse and Donald is worried that Tibby will not be able to make it back home safely. He convinces her to turn back and they make their way back to Tibby's house. Along the way, the storm gets worse and they are both getting cold and wet. However, they finally make it back to Tibby's house safely.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Tibby and Donald, and to foreshadow the impending storm. The author achieves these goals by having Tibby and Donald argue with each other, and by having Donald express his concern about the storm.
