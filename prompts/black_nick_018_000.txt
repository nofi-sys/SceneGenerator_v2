The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author also establishes the conflict in this scene - the Mohawks are terrified of the demon and want to flee, but Butler convinces them to stay and face the demon.

The style of this scene is suspenseful and creepy, with a hint of the supernatural. The point of view is third person omniscient, and the tone is ominous.

-The Mohawks are a small party of men who have fled from Burgoyne and are terrified of the demon they associate with Vermont and Stillwater. 
-When they are told by Butler of the scene which he himself had witnessed on that very spot--the one described in the commencement of our tale--and learned that the Mountain Demon had frequently made his appearance in those very woods, had in fact been tracked thither, the bravest warriors trembled. 
-Butler checks them from flight with consummate craft and reassures them that he is the Night Hawk who sees in the thick shades and that his spirit is more powerful than the demon's. 
-The dragoons dismount and give up their horses to the third of their companions while the men on foot, looking to their muskets, and fastening their sabers to the saddle, under Butlers orders, form in rear of the Indians.
-Then, with the partisan at their head, they advanced to the hollow tree in which the demon had once disappeared, which, as Butler had surmised, proved to be the entrance to a cavern. 
-Looking into the hollow, a gulf of unknown depth appeared below them, and the partisan hesitated a moment. Then he drew back and called for a lantern. 
-Butler, boldly taking the initiative, leaped down the cavity and found himself on firm ground, not six feet from the surface. With a cheery call, he held up the lantern to his followers, and disclosed the entrance to a rude flight of steps, cut downward into the earth, in a bed of solid rock. 
-In a few moments an Indian chief followed, trembling visibly, but resolved not to give way before the white men. Fastening the lantern to his belt, and holding his rifle ready for use, the resolute partisan slowly descended the steps, emerging at last into a lofty hall, crusted with stalactites, on which the light of the lantern flashed as if on a wall of diamonds. 
-He heard the soft, moccasined footsteps of the Indians, then the heavy clatter of spurs, as the dragoons descended, and at last the whole party entered the chamber, and stood gazing in wonder around them. 
-Butler now made a fresh disposition of his forces. Of lanterns there were seven, of that kind called bulls-eyes, and he ordered the soldiers bearing them to form a line behind him and advance abreast, casting a broad glare ahead. 
-They advanced through the long chamber, the only sounds audible being their own footsteps, and the hurried breathing of the excited men. Presently a narrow passage compelled them to stoop low and go in single file over a broken, crooked path, till they emerged into a second chamber, larger than the first, and the light of the lanterns came back to them from the mirror-like surface of a black pool, into which Butler had nearly fallen. 
-As he recovered himself with an involuntary exclamation, a loud, mocking peal of laughter sounded from the roof above them, and the sound, repeated by the echoes, came with a terrible effect to the ears of the explorers. As if to test their nerves to the utmost, there was a rushing in the air, close by, and a swarm of bats swished past them, brushing them with their wings and tangling in the long hair of several dragoons.
