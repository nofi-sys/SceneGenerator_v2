The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting, introduce the characters, and establish the conflict. The style is suspenseful and creepy, with a hint of the supernatural, and the tone is ominous. The point of view is third person omniscient. The Mohawks are a small party of men who have fled from Burgoyne and are terrified of the demon they associate with Vermont and Stillwater. When they are told by Butler of the scene which he himself had witnessed on that very spot--the one described in the commencement of our tale--and learned that the Mountain Demon had frequently made his appearance in those very woods, had in fact been tracked thither, the bravest warriors trembled. Butler checks them from flight with consummate craft and reassures them that he is the Night Hawk who sees in the thick shades and that his spirit is more powerful than the demon's. The dragoons dismount and give up their horses to the third of their companions while the men on foot, looking to their muskets, and fastening their sabers to the saddle, under Butlers orders, form in rear of the Indians. Then, with the partisan at their head, they advanced to the hollow tree in which the demon had once disappeared, which, as Butler had surmised, proved to be the entrance to a cavern.
