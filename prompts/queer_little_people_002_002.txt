A mother bird is trying to teach her two young sons, Tip-Top and Speckle, to get along and live in love. However, Tip-Top is a rebellious young bird who doesn't want to listen to his mother. He wants to leave the nest and see the world. One day, he sees a beautiful cat below the tree and the cat beckons him to come down and play. Tip-Top's mother warns him that the cat is a monster that will eat him, but he doesn't believe her. He thinks his mother is just trying to keep him from having any fun.
The next day, when the mother and father birds are gone, Tip-Top gets on the edge of the nest again and looks down at the cat. The cat's eyes shoot a light into Tip-Top's eyes and he falls into a trance. The cat takes him away and plays with him, torturing him until she's ready to eat him.
All the other little birds in the nest are screaming for their mother and father to come home. When they do, Mrs. Robin's bright eyes soon discover her poor little son, where Pussy has him under the currant-bushes. Mr. and Mrs. Robin join their plaintive chirping to the general confusion and Mrs. Robin calls the little folks to the spot by her cries.

The purpose of this scene is to teach a lesson about the dangers of being too trusting. The author achieves this goal by showing how Tip-Top is tricked by the cat and ends up in danger.
