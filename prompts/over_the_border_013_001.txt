In the scene, the protagonist meets Freddie, an old friend, who has become a successful sailor. Freddie is uninterested in the protagonist and only wants to talk about himself. The protagonist is disappointed in Freddie and leaves him. That night, the protagonist has a series of nightmares in which a formless, dark creature follows him. The nightmares are so bad that the protagonist changes his berth to get out of the port more quickly. When the protagonist wakes up the next morning, he sees Freddie being beaten by the second mate. Freddie overpowers the second mate and comes to talk to the protagonist.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator. However, there is a bit of foreshadowing in the description of Freddie's character, as well as in the dreams that the protagonist has been having. These elements give the scene a bit of an ominous feeling, hinting at the conflict to come.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Freddie and to foreshadow the events of the story. Freddie is established as a violent man with a quick temper. He is also shown to be someone who looks up to the protagonist and admires him. The scene also introduces the idea of the monster, which will be important later on.
