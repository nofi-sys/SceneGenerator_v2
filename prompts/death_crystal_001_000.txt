In the scene, Dave Crandall and Jane Nolan are discussing the recent explosion at the lab where they work. Dave suggests that the reason the lab exploded was because the scientists were not present to control the experiment, and Jane disagrees with him. Dave then goes on to say that he thinks the reason the lab exploded was because of the presence of the so-called "human aura." Jane is skeptical of this idea, and the two debate whether or not the aura is real.
