The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Dicky and to establish his background. The author achieves this by having the other characters talk about Dicky's past and by having Dicky himself talk about his dreams for the future.

The style of this scene is very dreamy and nostalgic. The characters are looking back on a time when they were all excited to meet Maida, a new girl who moved into their neighborhood. They remember all the wonderful things she used to tell them, and how they didn't believe her at first because they seemed too good to be true. But it turns out that everything she said was true, and they all wish she would come back. The tone is wistful and longing, and the point of view is from the perspective of the characters looking back on their memories.
