The scene opens with Liane, the leading lady of a theatre company, berating the company manager and cast for being "the off-scourings of the theatre". She is particularly angry with Marie Hauteville, a young woman in the company, whom she accuses of interrupting her private conversations and being a general nuisance. The manager tries to placate Liane, but she is having none of it and orders him to dismiss Margot, a member of the company, with whom she has been having a private conversation.
Margot, who has been standing by during the tirade, speaks up and says she does not know what she has done to deserve Liane's attack. Liane then turns on Margot, accusing her of being a "spot of infamy" and telling her to run and tell her "silly little Baron" that he has made an enemy. The scene ends with the manager announcing that there will be no rehearsal that morning and telling Margot and Marie to leave.

- Liane de Brances: the leading lady of the theatre, known for being cold-hearted and depraved. She is also very sentimental.
- Margot: a young woman who has just been dismissed from the theatre.
- Jeans: a man who Liane is sweet on, and who gives her violets every day.
- Monsieur Moncet: the manager of the theatre.
- Marie Hauteville: a young woman in the company who Liane is jealous of.

The literary style of this scene is one of anger and violence. The tone is harsh and the language is full of invective. The point of view is that of the protagonist, Liane, who is lashing out at Margot and the other characters in the scene.
