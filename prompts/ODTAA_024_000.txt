The style of this scene is very descriptive, with a lot of detail about the setting and the characters' actions and thoughts. The tone is one of suspense and fear, with a hint of the supernatural. The point of view is third person limited, focusing on Hi's perspective.

Hi wakes up suddenly to the sound of wild dogs crying in the forest. He jumps on his horse and they flee in terror. The horse eventually becomes exhausted and they have to stop. Hi tries to warm the horse up but he dies. Hi then tries to warm himself up and wait for the sun to rise. When it does, he is greeted by the sound of birds and the smell of sweet flowers. He finds a tree covered in white flowers and eats some of the petals. He feels better and goes back to his horse, only to find that it is dead.
