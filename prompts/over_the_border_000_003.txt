The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Felton as a man who is willing to fight for what he believes in, even against overwhelming odds. The author also uses the scene to establish the setting and tone of the story, which is one of hopelessness and despair.

Felton is aboard a ship that is being destroyed by enemy fire. He is angry and frustrated, and when one of the men kicks him, he loses his temper and starts fighting. He quickly realizes that the men are not interested in fighting back, and he eventually calms down.

The style of this scene is harsh and violent. The tone is one of anger and frustration, and the point of view is from Felton's perspective. The language is direct and blunt, and there is little description of the setting or the characters. Instead, the focus is on the action and the dialogue.
