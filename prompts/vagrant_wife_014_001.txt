She tries to coax him into taking his medicine and eventually he does. This shows that she cares for him and is willing to do what it takes to make him better.

The scene opens with Annie reading a book called Consuelo. Her husband, Harry, wakes up and starts to argue with her. He accuses her of not caring about him and not wanting to know how he feels. Annie tries to calm him down and tells him that she was just waiting for him to fall asleep again. Harry doesn't believe her and demands that she get him some brandy-and-soda. Annie refuses and tries to give him some medicine instead. Harry gets angry and tries to knock the glass out of her hand. Annie manages to calm him down and he takes the medicine. He then tells her that when he gets better, he will make her leave the house. Annie tries to reason with him and he eventually relents, telling her that she can stay until he gets better. He then tells her that she can kiss him if she wants to. Annie does so, not enthusiastically but with a touch of tenderness. Harry then falls asleep again and the scene ends.

The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is written in third person point of view, with a focus on the dialogue between the two characters. The tone is somewhat tense and emotional, but there is also a sense of humor present, particularly in the way the husband is described.
