The style of this scene is one of detachment and cynicism. The narrator describes the characters as "empty" and "nothing", and seems to have no empathy for their plight. There is also a sense of foreboding, as the scene ends with the robots approaching Alice.

Alice: A robot who has been passed off as a human domestic servant. She is lonely and longs for love.
Kelsey: Alice's "master." He is a cold, heartless man who is more concerned with his own comfort than with Alice's wellbeing.
The Tevee: A television that provides entertainment and news to the characters. It is a symbol of the emptiness of their lives.
The repair clinic: A place that fixes robots.
Julian: A character who is not fully developed. He is mentioned as having understood Alice a little bit.
