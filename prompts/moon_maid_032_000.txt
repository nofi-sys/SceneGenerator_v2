The literary style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a touch of humor. The point of view is third person omniscient. The tone is adventurous.

-The guard: "It was composed of five or six men. I suppose there were others in some nearby chamber." They are described as being slovenly and not paying attention.
-The Or-tis: "The Or-tis, selecting a mount haphazard, was saddling and bridling it." He is described as being excited and talking quickly.
-Red Lightning: "Love of The Flag! It was like finding my own brother." He is described as being fast and powerful.
