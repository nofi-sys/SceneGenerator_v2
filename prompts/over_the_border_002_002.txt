The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator. However, there is a bit of a tense shift near the end, when the narrator seems to switch to first person for a moment before going back to third person. This could be confusing for some readers.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Devlin and to establish the conflict in the story. The author also establishes the setting and provides some background information on the protagonist.

The scene opens with the protagonist recounting how he and his fellow sailors trained Devlin, an imbecile, to perform basic tasks on their ship. They taught him to speak, and he gradually learned to understand and communicate in short, choppy sentences. However, one of the sailors, Swansen, jokingly called Devlin a dog, and from then on, Devlin reverted back to his dog-like state, barking and growling instead of speaking.
The ship eventually reaches port, and Devlin is sent to a hospital. The protagonist, who has since quit the sea and is now working on shore, visits a hypnotist in hopes of restoring his memories of the voyage. The hypnotist is successful, and the protagonist is able to recall more and more details of the trip each day.
He eventually goes to visit Devlin in the hospital, but is not allowed in because he is not acquainted with the patient. He enlists the help of his old shipmate, Sullivan, and together they go to Tammany Hall to get a pass to the hospital.
They find the hypnotist packing up to leave town, and he agrees to come with them to the hospital. When they arrive, they are able to locate Devlin and the hypnotist successfully restores his memories.
