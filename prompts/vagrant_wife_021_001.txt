The purpose of this scene is to reveal the financial ruin of George, and to show how this news affects the different members of the family. The author achieves this by having Stephen break the news to Annie, and then showing how Annie reacts when she learns that her husband is taking the news very hard.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and simple. There is a bit of dialogue, but mostly it is a description of what is happening. The tone is somewhat anxious and tense, as the characters are discussing some bad news. The point of view is third person limited, as we only know what the characters are thinking and feeling.

- Stephen tells Annie that George has "smashed up" and is ruined
- Annie is relieved to hear that George is not dead, but is sympathetic
- Stephen tells Annie that Harry is taking the news very hard and is upset that he will have to leave her
- Annie goes to talk to Harry and finds out that he is upset because he was hoping she would give up acting and come live with him at the Grange
- Annie tries to reassure Harry that she still wants to be with him, but he is skeptical
