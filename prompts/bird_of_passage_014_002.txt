Mr. Lisle and Helen Denis are discussing a strange object in the sky, which the General has told them is called Moses' Horn. They debate whether or not it is a sign of something bad to come, with Mr. Lisle eventually convincing Helen that it is nothing more than a natural phenomenon. The conversation turns to the topic of women's changeability, with Mr. Lisle asserting that women are as changeable as the weather. Helen takes offense to this, and the two argue good-naturedly until the object in the sky fades away.

The tone of this scene is light and playful, with a hint of flirtation between the two characters. The point of view is third person limited, focusing on the conversation between Helen and Mr. Lisle. The style is conversational and informal.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Helen and Mr. Lisle and to set up the conflict between them. The author achieves this by having them discuss the Moses' Horn phenomenon and then argue about the changeability of women.
