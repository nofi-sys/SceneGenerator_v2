In this scene, two old women are talking in the kitchen of a squalid building. One of the women is sweeping the floor and the other is sitting by the stove, smoking a pipe. They are discussing the recent decline in business and attributing it to the presence of a "Know-nothin" (a derogatory term for an Irish Protestant). They also talk about how this man, years ago, was responsible for the burning of a Catholic church. Ellen, the woman by the stove, suddenly starts coughing and says that she remembers this man standing by the fence, ready to shoot any of them if they showed their heads.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author also establishes the theme of the story, which is the conflict between good and evil.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its use of dialect, its focus on the working class, and its gritty realism.
