- protagonist is a cracksman (burglar) trying to find the right tools for the job
- he goes to a medical supply store and pretends to be buying for his brother, a doctor
- he picks out a few things, including a stethoscope, which the clerk insists is very powerful

1. The crowd - a mass of nameless faces
2. Fay - a professional thief
3. The salesman - polite and helpful

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of paranoia and suspicion.
