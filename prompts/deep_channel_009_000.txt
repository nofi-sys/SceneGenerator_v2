The scene opens with Elizabeth Bixby and her landlady, Aunt Sadie, settling down in Mrs. Johnson's rooms. They quickly become friends and begin to go out together often. Elizabeth is lonely and has a lot of spare time, which she often kills by lying in bed, gossiping, or paying attention to her clothes. Meanwhile, her husband, Mr. Bixby, has very methodical habits. Every morning, he gets his own breakfast and then goes about his business. Julie, the protagonist, is used to hearing him tiptoe around upstairs.
One morning, there is a sudden clatter and crash of tinware from the Bixbys' apartment, followed by a flood of abuse from Elizabeth. Mr. Bixby comes down the stairs and apologizes to Julie, who is sweeping the front steps. They exchange a few pleasantries and then go their separate ways. However, the scene ends on a note of intimacy, with the two characters revealing a bit of their true personalities to each other.
