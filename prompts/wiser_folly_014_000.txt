The author achieves these goals by having John be pleased with the prospect of seeing Molly again and by having Mrs. Trimwell establish Molly as a mischievous character.

The style of this scene is light and humorous. The tone is playful and there is a sense of fun in the way Mrs. Trimwell tells her story. The point of view is third person limited, with the focus on John.
