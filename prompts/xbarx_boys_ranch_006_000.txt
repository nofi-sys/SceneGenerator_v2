They dismount and approach the cabin cautiously. Teddy peeks in the window and sees two men inside, asleep. He and Roy quietly enter the cabin and tie up the men. They search the cabin for their horses, but they are not there.
The men wake up and tell the boys that their horses are at the next cabin down the trail. Teddy and Roy mount their horses and ride to the next cabin. They find their horses there, along with two more men who are asleep.
The boys tie up the men and search the cabin for anything else that might be useful. They find a map of the area, and they also find a bag of money. They take the map and the money, and then they mount their horses and ride back down the trail.
When they get back to the ranch, they tell Mr. Manley what happened. They give him the map and the money, and he is very pleased. He gives them a reward and they go back to their cabin.
