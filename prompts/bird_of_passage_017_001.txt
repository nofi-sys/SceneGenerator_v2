In the scene, Helen is painting a landscape under the guidance of Mr. Lisle. He criticizes her work and tells her that she needs to make the sea more green and the perspective more accurate. She tries again and he is pleased with the results. They then discuss the Andaman Islands and how they are a place of simplicity and solitude. Mr. Lisle compliments Helen on her knowledge and then asks her to share her thoughts with him. She starts to say that she thinks everyone has a place in the world and a duty to fulfill, but then gets embarrassed and says she shouldn't be criticizing him. Mr. Lisle encourages her to continue and she finishes her thought, saying that she thinks it's wrong for people to shirk their responsibilities and duties in the world just for the sake of being in a place like the Andaman Islands where there are no annoyances.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Mr. Lisle and Helen Denis, and to set up the conflict between them. Mr. Lisle is established as a lazy, self-indulgent man who is content to while away his days in idleness. Helen, on the other hand, is shown to be a more serious, thoughtful person who is critical of Mr. Lisle's lifestyle.

-Helen Denis: a young girl, meek and shy, with childlike interest
-Mr. Lisle: a lazy, older man who likes to spend his time in his own way
-Mrs. Creery: an older woman, fable-telling, with a love for her pet Nip
