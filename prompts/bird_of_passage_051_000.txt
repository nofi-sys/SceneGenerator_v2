The scene takes place in a garden, where three girls are picking raspberries into a tin can. One of the girls, Helen, asks her cousin Dido what their uncle is doing. Dido explains that he is inventing a machine that is going to be a great success. However, she does not know what it is. Katie, another cousin, interrupts to say that their father is not doing well because he is not in his element and does not have any congenial society. Dido and Katie then begin to talk about how their father is too trusting of strangers and how he has been taken advantage of in the past. Dido gets angry and says that she is going to go weigh the strawberries. As she leaves, Katie tells Helen that they are very poor.

The style of this scene is conversational and matter-of-fact. The tone is one of resignation and resignation, with a hint of bitterness. The point of view is third person limited.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of the three girls and to provide some background information on their lives. The author achieves this by having the girls discuss their father's work and their own poverty.
