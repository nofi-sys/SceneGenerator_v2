Carlin, a cosmic engineer for a star-ship line, has just arrived on Earth and is looking for lodgings. He meets Jonny Land, a young man who offers to take him to his home on the condition that he doesn't mind a little discomfort. Carlin agrees and they head off in an old ato-truck.
As they drive, Carlin is struck by the primitive state of the planet. The roads are old and in disrepair, the houses are old and unkempt, and the vegetation is overgrown. He also notices that the people seem to be afraid of something, though he doesn't know what.
When they arrive at Jonny's home, Carlin is met with more of the same. The house is old and rundown, and there are no signs of modern technology anywhere. Carlin is tired and disheartened, but he decides to make the best of it.
 Jonny's family is made up of his grandfather, his brother and sister, and himself. They are all very hospitable, but Carlin can't help feeling out of place. He is also surprised to learn that they still practice hydroponic farming, which is something he thought had disappeared from the galaxy.
As he settles in, Carlin begins to wonder what the people of Earth are so afraid of. He gets his answer when Jonny's brother Loesser, who is very hostile towards Carlin, let's slip that they are afraid of the Control. Carlin doesn't know what that is, but he gets the feeling that it is something illegal that they are doing.
Despite the primitive conditions, Carlin decides to make the best of it and try to enjoy his time on Earth.

The style of this scene is rather dry and matter-of-fact. There is no real emotional intensity, although there is a hint of tension between the two young men. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Carlin's perspective.

-Carlin: thin, pleasant brown face, intelligent blue eyes, Cosmic Engineer, star-ship line chief surveyor
