The literary style of this scene is characterized by its tense, anxious tone. The point of view is from Julie's perspective, and we see her thoughts and feelings as she agonizes over her mistakes from the evening before. The style is also quite descriptive, painting a vivid picture of Julie's emotional state.

The purpose of this scene is to show how Julie is feeling after her embarrassing experience at church. She is full of self-hatred and regret, and she is obsessing over the fact that everyone will now know she is afraid to pray in public.

Julie is nervous about having to go to Red River to do some shopping for Mrs. Wicket and Miss Mary. She is afraid that they will find out how she knows that Brother Seabrook called on her. When they are outside in the garden, she hears Mrs. Wicket say that she will find out all about it tomorrow. Julie is angry with herself for being so afraid and for running away.
