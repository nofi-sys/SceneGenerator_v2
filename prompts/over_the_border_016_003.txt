A woman walks in her sleep and is found by her husband with a knife in her hand. He questions her and she says she is trying to save herself from her enemy. When asked who her enemy is, she says she does not know but that he will kill her if she cannot explain. Beverton then deduces that she is sleepwalking and that her enemy is actually their baby.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its suspenseful, mysterious tone. The point of view is third person limited, and the reader is only privy to Beverton's thoughts and actions. This creates a sense of unease and tension, as we are not sure what is going on inside the wife's mind. The use of short, declarative sentences also adds to the sense of suspense, as each new piece of information is revealed.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Beverton's wife as a somnambulist, and to introduce the idea that she is being threatened by an unknown enemy. The author achieves these goals by having the wife walk in her sleep and talk about her enemy.
