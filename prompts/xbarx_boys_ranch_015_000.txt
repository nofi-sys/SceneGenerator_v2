The scene opens with the preparations for a dance at the 8 X 8 ranch. The living room has been decorated and the orchestra is getting ready. Nell and Belle Ada are in Belle's room trying to decide which of Belle's light summer dresses she should wear. Teddy, Roy, and Ethel are walking to the mess-house to see if the orchestra is ready and they overhear Nick Looker loudly declaring that the punchers are not playing the music correctly. They sneak up and peek through the door to see that Nick is playing the mouth-organ, Sing Lung is playing the violin, and Jim Casey is playing the accordion. Teddy offers to be the trap-drummer, but his offer is declined.

The style of this scene is lighthearted and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person omniscient.
