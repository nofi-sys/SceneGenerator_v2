The style of this scene is conversational and colloquial. The tone is light and friendly. The point of view is third person limited.

The scene opens with Dud, a high school student, walking to the train station to meet his friend Jimmie, who is returning from a baseball game. Jimmie tells Dud about the game, which Grafton lost 12-7. He describes how he himself played, including making a costly error that led to two runs scoring. He also mentions that the other team's pitcher was very difficult to hit.
Dud and Jimmie then walk back to campus, discussing the baseball game and the track meet that Grafton won earlier in the day. As they near the school, they see the Mount Morris track team leaving on the train. Jimmie speculates about whether or not he has a chance to make the Grafton baseball team, given that there are already several players ahead of him. The scene ends with the two boys parting ways.
