The scene opens with the prisoners Hoppy and Win discussing the situation. Hoppy is sure that the British commander, Raggett, intends to use him to pilot the British tenders and barges in the shallow waters of the bay. He tells Win that there is no use in resisting the plans of the British commander.
Hoppy explains that Raggett knows that he will have no difficulty in getting the three hundred dollars in Boston and that he cannot put forward any excuses to the contrary. He also points out that if the towns refuse to pay tribute, they will have no choice but to pay.
Win is not convinced by Hoppy's argument that the British will not be able to land a large force and attack the villages. Hoppy insists that the flats will more than compensate for the difference in numbers and that the British will not take the risk of landing a large force.
Captain Knowles is a man of tried courage but he does not share Hoppy's optimism. He points out that the British could destroy the salt works and that the people of Cape Cod are not well equipped to fight the British.
Hoppy is adamant that the British will not be able to land a large force and that the Americans will be able to repel them. The scene ends with the two men still disagreeing about the outcome of the British attack.

The tone of this scene is one of determination and resolve. The point of view is from the perspective of the two prisoners, Hoppy and Win.

1. Hoppy: A prisoner who is confident that the Americans will win any battle against the British.
2. Win: A prisoner who is skeptical of Hoppy's optimism.
3. Raggett: The British commander who is planning to use Hoppy to pilot British ships in the shallow waters of the bay.
4. Samoset: A Native American who welcomed the Englishmen when they first arrived.
5. Captain Knowles: A man of courage who is in charge of the American forces.
