The scene opens with the protagonist, a captive of the Va-gas, being interrogated by Ga-va-go, the chief of the Va-gas. Ga-va-go is trying to determine if the protagonist can lead him to a land where there is plenty of flesh to eat. The protagonist tells Ga-va-go that he cannot lead him to such a land, as it is on another world. Ga-va-go is skeptical, but decides to let the protagonist live for now.
The Va-gas are a nomadic people, and they soon break camp and begin moving to a new location. The protagonist is transported by a Va-ga warrior, and they travel with the rest of the Va-gas, who are well-protected against surprise attacks. They travel for some time, crossing rivers and skirting lakes, until they reach a high point from which the protagonist can see the waters of a great ocean.

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. The narrator is telling the story from a third person point of view, and the tone is relatively neutral. There is no real emotion or feeling conveyed in the writing.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the main character. The author achieves this by describing the landscape and the people the protagonist will encounter.
