The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is relatively neutral. There is some dialogue, but it is not particularly noteworthy.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Dud and to show how he is feeling about himself and his abilities. The author achieves this by having Dud interact with other characters and by having him think about his own performance.

Dud is pitching for the first time in a while and is struggling to regain his control. Mr. Sargent is coaching Ayer from first to second and on to third, making him slide to every base even though he is not threatened. When, however, he tries to steal home on Duds wind-up, Dud manages to keep his head, send in a fast one and saw Ayer nailed a yard from the rubber.
