Hi is a stranger who has arrived at a ranch house in the middle of the night. He knocked on the door and, when no one answered, went inside. He found a big, empty house with a meal set out on the table but no sign of any people. He explored the kitchen and found it empty too, except for a black cat.
Hi made a mash for his horse and then moved him to a more sheltered spot behind the rain vats. He was hoping that somebody would come while he was outside, but there was no sign of anyone. Hi began to feel uneasy and decided to leave. As he was leaving, he heard a noise from one of the outhouses. He went to investigate and found a man inside, who was very surprised to see him.
