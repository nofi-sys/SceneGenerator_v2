A German duke is relaxing by the fire after dinner when he falls asleep and is visited by two figures, one of whom is Miss Macpherson. They discuss a dispatch from Captain Strange which tells of Neil Mackenzie's failed attempt to capture Muckle John and Rob Fraser. Miss Macpherson suggests that Castleleathers take Mackenzie's place in order to gain the Duke's favor.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of the Duke of Cumberland and to foreshadow the events to come. The author achieves this by showing the Duke's arrogance and lack of empathy, as well as his desire for revenge against the Jacobites.

The style of this scene is very descriptive, with a focus on the setting and the characters' emotions. The point of view is third person omniscient.
