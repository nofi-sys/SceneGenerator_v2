The scene is set in a church, where a small group of people are attending mass. One of the worshippers is a young girl named Rosie OHara, who is praying fervently at the altar rail. The other people in the church, including the priest, are paying little attention to her.
Larry Murphy, a regular churchgoer, is sitting in a pew near the back of the church. He notices Rosie and is struck by her beauty and her intensity of prayer. He does not recognize her, however.
As the mass comes to an end, Rosie lingers in the church, praying at the altar of a side altar. When everyone else has left, she goes up to the main altar and kneels before the crucifix, kissing the feet of Christ. She then leaves the church.
Outside, she is met by Jimmie Larkin, who is angry with her for something. He accuses her of being involved in a "cross game" (a con game or swindle), and Rosie denies knowing anything about it. Larkin doesn't believe her and threatens to fight her.
Larry Murphy comes out of the church just in time to see the two of them arguing. He calls out to Larkin, asking him what the problem is. Larkin tells Larry that he knows about the cross game and accuses Larry of being involved in it. Larry denies any knowledge of the game, but Larkin doesn't believe him.
Larkin threatens to fight Larry, but Larry tells him to calm down. He says he doesn't know what Larkin is talking about, and he doesn't want to fight his friend. Larkin doesn't listen, and he swings at Larry, hitting him in the face. Larry falls to the ground, and Larkin starts to kick him.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Larry and Jimmie. Jimmie is angry with Larry because he believes that Larry tricked him, and Larry is confused and doesn't understand why Jimmie is so upset.
