1. The spiritual professor - a pale, ashy-faced man
2. The doctor - a kind man with a pure soul
3. The patient - a plain, but much-afflicted woman

The literary style of this scene is very formal and clinical. The narrator is third person omniscient, and the tone is detached and objective. There is a sense of foreboding and suspense throughout.

The doctor is treating a patient who is bleeding from the mouth. He is trying to restore her to a state of calm and sleep in order to stop the bleeding. However, he is distracted by her beauty and the sensual way she is lying. He feels ashamed of himself for thinking these thoughts and tries to focus on his work.
