The style of this scene is very formal and polite. Liane is very matter-of-fact and Jean is very deferential. There is a sense of distance between them, even though they are speaking to each other.

-Jean: a young, passionate musician who falls in love with the famous actress, Liane de Brances
-Liane de Brances: a beautiful and successful actress who takes a liking to Jean and invites him into her dressing room
-The dresser: a woman who works for Liane and is the recipient of her abuse

The scene opens with Jean seeing Liane in the last act of La Fin de l'Amour, and Liane seeing him. Liane thinks to herself that if she's not too busy, she'll give him an evening to meet a few artists. She's good-natured and likes to do inexpensive good turns, and if there's really anything remarkable in Jean's powers, it would prove something of a _rclame_ for Liane herself. But she's never thought of him more personally until now, as she looks over the footlights and sees the fierce ardour in his eyes.
The next evening, Jean comes to the theatre early and sees the first act of La Fin de l'Amour. He's entranced by Liane's performance, and falls in love with her. He soon receives a message from her, asking him to come backstage, and he does so, astounded that she would remember him.
Liane is in her dressing room, finishing her third-act costume. The dresser is still in the room, and Liane gives her a running fire of dispassionate abuse. She tells Jean that tomorrow is Sunday and she wants him to meet all her music-maker friends at her place at 10am. Then she has to go, and she tells Jean he may kiss her hand if he likes.
Jean is left in a daze, overwhelmed by emotion.
