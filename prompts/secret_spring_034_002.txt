A French lieutenant is questioning a German major who has been captured by the French 22nd regiment. The major is uncooperative and refuses to answer any questions, so the lieutenant asks the men who captured him if they found anything on him. One of the men produces a crumpled piece of paper, which turns out to be the draft of a letter written by the major. The lieutenant recognizes the major as Ulrich von Boose, the murderer of the Grand Duke Rudolph of Lautenburg-Detmold. The lieutenant is so shocked by this discovery that he has to be excused from the interrogation. He asks that Lieutenant Vignerte be brought in, as he knows everything about the major.
