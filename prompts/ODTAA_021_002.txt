-The man: evil-looking, strong, possibly armed
-The woman: possibly armed, called out to the man for help with something
-Hi: young, confused, scared

Hi is in the forest with a man and woman who he does not trust. The man is leading him on a horse, and the woman is following behind. Hi is trying to think of a way to escape when the woman calls out to the man. The man seems angry at the request, but goes to the woman anyway. Hi takes this opportunity to escape on the horse. The man runs after him, but Hi gets away. He is not sure where he is going, but he knows he needs to get away from the man and woman.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonists. The author achieves this by having the protagonist, Hi, notice the strange behavior of the couple and the third horse, and by having the man lead Hi into the forest. This creates a sense of unease and danger for the protagonist, and sets up the conflict for the rest of the story.
