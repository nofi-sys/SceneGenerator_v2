The purpose of this scene is to introduce the two main characters, Elizabeth and David, and to establish their initial impressions of each other. The author also uses the scene to establish the setting and tone of the story.

Elizabeth: a woman with glossy brown hair, a palely bronzed skin, red lips, a square chin, a delicately chiselled nose, and grey eyes. She is wearing a cream-coloured cotton dress and a pink la France rose is tucked into the front of her gown.
David: a big man in shabby tweeds with a square face and darkish red hair. He has a mat of darkish red hair.

Elizabeth is sitting at a table near an open window in the Green Man, a coffeehouse. She is enjoying the view of the garden and the stream beyond when the door opens and a man walks in. The man, David, is surprised to see Elizabeth already there and goes to sit at the table by the other window. Elizabeth can tell that David is attracted to her and, when he doesn't take sugar in his coffee, she takes the opportunity to offer him some from her own bowl. They chat for a bit and Elizabeth learns that David is a bit shy and diffident. She also gets the sense that he is a deep thinker. Elizabeth likes him and they continue to talk.
