-Sloan, Hugh, and their lawyer visit Ralph Dodson's office to ask to see the paper he and Singlefoot Bill signed.
-Dodson is out, but his brother Robert is in. At first he refuses to meet them, but they are so insistent that he relents.
-Dodson listens to their request and then goes to the safe to retrieve the paper.
-The paper is an agreement by which Singlefoot Bill relinquishes all rights to certain mining claims in exchange for $3,000.
-Browning copies the paper exactly and then they leave.
-On their way out, Sloan watches them carefully.
-The McClintocks and their lawyer decide to investigate the claims and the contract further to see if there is anything fishy going on.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the McClintocks and the Dodsons, and to introduce the idea that there may be something fishy about the Dodsons' claim to the mining claims in question.
