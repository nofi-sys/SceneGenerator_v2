John and Corin are discussing Corin's proposal that John accompany him to the village of Malford. John is uninterested in the idea, finding it difficult to see what advantages there could be in doing so. Corin tries to convince John by appealing to his sense of companionship and by describing the beauty of the countryside. John remains unconvinced, but Corin continues to try to persuade him. Eventually John relents and agrees to go with Corin to Malford.
