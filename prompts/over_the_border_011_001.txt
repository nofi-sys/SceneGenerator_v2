The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist. The author also establishes the setting and introduces the supporting characters.

The mate, Mr. Butterell, is berating the helmsman, Bill, and Mabel is seated in a deck chair on the weather quarter. The narrator goes to relieve the mate, but he has other matters on his mind. He collars Bill and sends him up the lee rigging to the upper topsail yardarm, where he is to keep a lookout until four bells. Mabel rises from her seat and the mate places Bill's knife on the house over his window. The girl calmly asks the mate not to arouse the men to such language as she has just been compelled to listen to. The mate growls and turns to the narrator. The watch is relieved and the narrator shouts for the weather main- and cro'-jack clew-garnets and buntlines to be taken in.
