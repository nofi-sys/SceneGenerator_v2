The style of this scene is formal and stilted. The dialogue is stiff and unnatural, and the characters seem to be more concerned with being polite than with saying anything of substance. There is a sense of tension between the characters, and a feeling that they are holding back their true feelings from each other.

Mrs. Wylie is worried that her friend Mrs. Lucien is becoming interested in Dr. Lyman's theories, which she believes are harmful. She tells her husband that she is afraid Mrs. Lucien will be ruined by them, body and soul. Mr. Wylie scolds her for her blind prejudice and tells her that she does not know what she is talking about.
