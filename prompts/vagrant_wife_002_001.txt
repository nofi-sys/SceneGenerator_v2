- Miss Lane is out walking and drawing in a field by a pond.
- Harry has been watching her and approaches her from across the pond.
- They make small talk and Miss Lane is cold to him.
- Harry gets rude and Miss Lane scolds him.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two characters, Harry and Miss Lane. The author achieves this by having them discuss their opinions on houses and the people who live in them.

- Miss Lane: a governess who is spending her half-holiday walking and drawing in the fields. She is conscientious and hardworking, but not very skilled at drawing.
- Harry Braithwaite: a young man who is watching Miss Lane from across the pond. He is feeling guilty about an enterprise he is undertaking, and is thus half sheepish and half bold.
- George Braithwaite: Harry's brother, who is also watching him from the road.
