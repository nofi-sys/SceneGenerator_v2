The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a touch of humor. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is serious.

Hugh and Vicky discuss their plans to escape with Dutch and head to Carson City. They agree that Jim Budd will pose as Dutch and they will all three leave together after supper. They know that the house is being watched, but they are counting on the fact that their pursuers will be expecting two men, not three. Jim Budd will be "captured" and tied up, and they will make their way to Carson City. Along the way, they will be followed by their pursuers, but they are counting on the fact that once they reach Carson City, they will be able to get Dutch to safety and expose the real culprits behind Scot's murder.
