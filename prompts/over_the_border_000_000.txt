The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with little in the way of embellishment or poetic language. The tone is fairly matter-of-fact, and the point of view is third-person omniscient.

- Mr. Clarkson: the executive officer, a "visionary and theorist"
- Mr. Felton: the torpedo lieutenant, young and dogmatic
- the other officers: off duty, discussing the future of warfare

It is nearly midnight, and the battleship Argyll is drifting with its fires banked but a full head of steam, waiting for daybreak to discover the enemy. Wireless news has told of the presence of submarines, as yet unproved in war, and before the sun has gone down, a high-power telescope on board has spotted two small moving spots in the sky - airships. But it is not yet known whether they are friends or enemies.
All the men are awake, either at their stations or talking, and a group of officers discuss the possibilities of future warfare. They debate the impact of the new weapons - the bomb-dropping dirigible balloon and the submarine with its torpedo. The discussion becomes heated, with the young Mr. Felton becoming dogmatic in his assertions.
The executive officer, Mr. Clarkson, tries to reason with Felton, pointing out that the battleship has almost reached the limit of its size and development, while the airship and the submarine are still in their infancy. Felton is not convinced, and argues that the battleship is still the best fighting machine.
 eventually, Mr. Felton is called to his station and the discussion ends. But Felton is still hot and excited, and cannot sleep. He is finally dozing off when the gun-room orderly taps at his door to tell him that all hands are at their stations - they are going into action.
