-Mr. Lisle: a man, middle-aged, who has been through a lot of physical and mental stress recently
-Mrs. Creery: an older woman, motherly
-Mrs. Home: an older woman
-Mrs. Graham: an older woman
-Mrs. Green: an older woman
-Miss Denis (Helen): a young woman, pretty
-Mr. Quentin: a younger man, Lisle's partner, not very active

The style of this scene is rather dry and matter-of-fact. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is somewhat cynical.

- Mr. Lisle is sitting in a chair in the verandah, thinking about the woman he rescued the night before
- Mr. Quentin comes home and they have a conversation about the storm
- A boatman comes and gives Mr. Lisle a parasol that belonged to the woman
- Mr. Lisle remembers that he left his dinner at her house and goes back to get it
