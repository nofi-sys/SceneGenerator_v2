Henry and Hannah Hindes discuss what to do about Jenny Crampton, who has eloped with a Catholic man. They decide that Henry will go to Dover to find her and tell her of her father's decision.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Mr. Crampton and his daughter, Jenny. Mr. Crampton is angry and upset because Jenny has married a Catholic man without his consent, and he is further upset because Jenny has lied to him about it. Jenny's husband, Mr. Walcheren, has also lied to Mr. Crampton about his intentions.
The scene also establishes the character of Mr. Crampton as a proud and stubborn man who is not willing to forgive his daughter for her disobedience. He is also shown to be a man who is easily manipulated by his emotions.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its formal, polite tone. The dialogue is stiff and formal, befitting the upper-class status of the characters. There is a sense of propriety and decorum throughout the scene, which is broken only by Mr Crampton's outburst near the end. The point of view is third person omniscient.
