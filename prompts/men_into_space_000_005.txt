- McCauley: the protagonist, a lieutenant who is piloting the Aerobee rocket
- the voice in McCauley's helmet: presumably a ground control operator
- the men working on the launch tower and in the mountains: nameless workers who are helping to launch the rocket
- the Aerobee rocket: the rocket itself

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of McCauley and to show the reader what he is thinking and feeling as he prepares for and undergoes his rocket launch. The author achieves this by providing detailed descriptions of the preparations and the launch itself from McCauley's perspective.

- McCauley is in the Aerobee, preparing for takeoff
- He is hooked up to telemetry which is recording everything he feels and thinks
- He is waiting for the final countdown and blastoff
- The takeoff is rough and he is momentarily blinded and unable to breathe
- The second stage of acceleration is even worse, lasting for what seems like hours
- He responds to signals via a green light, but at one point it flashes too fast for him to keep up
