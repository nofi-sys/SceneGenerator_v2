Joe Marino and Gus Tripp have been drinking and are now on their way back to the X Bar X ranch. They are met by Roy Manley, who tells them that his father wants to see them.
The three men go to the corral, where Mr. Manley is waiting. He is angry that they have been drinking and tells them that they are no longer welcome on the ranch.
Joe Marino is angry and tries to argue with Mr. Manley, but Roy tells him to be quiet. Joe then sneers at Roy and tells him that he is only the boss's son and has no authority.
 Roy is angry but does not want to argue with a man who has been drinking. He walks away and Teddy later tells him what happened. Joe and Gus are no longer welcome on the ranch.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and simple. It is told from the third person point of view, and there is a fairly neutral tone throughout. There is some dialogue, but it is not particularly poetic or flowery.
