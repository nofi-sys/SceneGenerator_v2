The scene opens with Teddy recalling the long knife with which Marino had attacked him, and feeling a shudder of fear at the thought that The Pup might return to the ranch and try to enter the house. The boys muscles tighten and he drives his paddle in more forcefully, sending a shower of spray over his brother, who is seated in the canoe behind him.
Roy asks Teddy what is on his mind, and Teddy confesses that he is worried about their mother and sisters, and whether or not The Pup will return to the ranch. Bug Eye interrupts to say that he believes The Pup is headed for the Border, and Teddy is relieved to hear this.
Teddy then shows Roy the knife he took from The Pup's hand, and says that he was afraid The Pup might come back to the ranch and try to hurt someone. Roy reassures Teddy, telling him that he has already taken precautions to protect the family, including posting a guard at the ranch house.
Teddy is relieved to hear this, and the two brothers paddle on, with Pop keeping up a strong pace in the stern. The scene ends with the three of them racing down the river.
