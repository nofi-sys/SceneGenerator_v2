A young man, M. Nivires, is chatting with a dowager countess and her companion, a stout matron, in the countess's home. The countess orders a light supper for M. Nivires, to be served in his apartment, and specifies that three loaves of bread are to be included. Zphyrine, the servant, appears surprised and confused by the request.
M. Nivires is shown to his suite of three rooms, which are luxurious and furnished in the Louis XV style. He is attended by his own servant, Baptiste, who is in training. M. Nivires is surprised to find a repast laid out for him, including three loaves of bread, and wonders what the countess could be thinking.
Someone knocks at the door of the antechamber, and M. Nivires is surprised to find the countess herself there, bearing a fourth loaf of bread. She explains that she was worried he would be hungry and that she wanted to make sure he had enough to eat. M. Nivires is touched by the countess's thoughtfulness.
