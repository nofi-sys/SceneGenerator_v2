The tone of this scene is one of anger and frustration, with a hint of fear underlying Mr Crampton's words. The point of view is from Mr Crampton's perspective, and the style is that of a conversation between Mr Crampton, Mrs Crampton, and Mr Hindes.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Mr. Crampton and his daughter Jenny over her relationship with Frederick Walcheren. Mr. Crampton is determined to end the relationship because he feels that Walcheren is not good enough for Jenny and is only after her money. Jenny is equally determined to continue the relationship, despite her father's wishes. This conflict will drive the rest of the story.

Mr Crampton is angry with his daughter for disobeying him and for flirting with a young man he does not approve of. He threatens to lock her up if she does not stop seeing the young man. Mrs Crampton and Aunt Clem try to calm him down, but he is not interested in their opinion. Henry Hindes is the only one who seems to be on Mr Crampton's side. He tells Mr Crampton that he is making a mountain out of a molehill and that his daughter is probably not as interested in the young man as Mr Crampton thinks she is. Mrs Crampton agrees with Hindes and says that her husband should speak to their daughter. Mr Crampton finally agrees and goes to speak to his daughter.
