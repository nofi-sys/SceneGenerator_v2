The literary style of this scene is light-hearted and humorous. The tone is playful and the point of view is third person omniscient.

In the scene, two bears are approaching a ledge where Teddy and Roy are sitting. Teddy and Roy know that the new arrival cannot come at them from the side, as the corners of the shelf tapered into the straight wall. Teddy is bitter, and Roy is trying to come up with a plan.
Roy has an idea, and tells Teddy to put a buck-strap on his lower lip. Teddy does not understand, but does as he is told. Roy then explains his plan - to tie a weight to the fishline and throw it over the edge of the ledge, with the goal of catching the rifle in the hook. Once the rifle is caught, they can shoot the bears and go home.
Teddy is not sure about the plan, but goes along with it. He settles himself in a sitting position on the ledge with his back to the wall, so that he is out of sight of the bears below. Roy carefully judges the distance from the ledge to the spot where the gun lay, estimating the length of line he would have to use.
By this time, the two bears are in close conference and Teddy waves his hand grandly, quoting, "You may fire when ready, Gridley!" Roy throws the line over the edge of the ledge and the plan is set in motion.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two main characters, Teddy and Roy. Teddy is the comic relief, while Roy is the more serious and level-headed of the two. The author also establishes the setting and the stakes of the conflict (i.e. the two bears).
