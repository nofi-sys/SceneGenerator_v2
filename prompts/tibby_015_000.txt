The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The point of view is third person omniscient. The tone is somewhat ominous and foreboding.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Professor Russell and to foreshadow the events of the evening. The author achieves these goals by having the Professor accurately predict the arrival of two absent characters and by having the other characters react with fear and superstition to his powers.
