Captain Strike and the crew of the space ship _The Ark_ are on a mission to colonize the planet Mars. However, when they stop to refuel on the planet Triton, they are met with resistance from the local inhabitants. Dacres, Monk, and the other substitute crewmen, who are armed, burst into the room where Strike and Carlyle are talking. It is clear that they are planning to mutiny.
Strike and Carlyle are able to talk the crewmen down and convince them to return to their duties. However, Strike is now suspicious of the new crewmen and keeps a close eye on them for the rest of the journey. When they finally arrive on Mars, it is clear that the new crewmen were not planning to colonize the planet, but were instead planning to take over the ship and use it for their own purposes.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the mutiny that is taking place on the ship. The author achieves this goal by having Strike overhear a conversation, search the belongings of the new crewmen, and find a gun in Monk's space-bag.

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of mystery and danger. The point of view is third person omniscient, and the tone is serious.
