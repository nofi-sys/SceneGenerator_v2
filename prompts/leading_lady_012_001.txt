Bassett speaks up, saying that he is the one who told Aleck and the others about the situation. He insists that they only heard the truth from him, and that he is willing to tell them everything. He confesses to being in love with her and reveals that his wife was jealous.
Aleck jumps to his feet and angrily tells them that they are in no position to judge him and his wife. He insists that there were other people on the island who could have had a motive for murder. He points the finger at Joe Tracy, saying that he was a "damned devil of a boy with a record" who had been acting angrily towards her the day before.

The purpose of this scene is to establish Stokes as a suspect in the murder investigation. The author achieves this by having Stokes confess his passion for the victim and his jealousy of her husband, as well as his anger towards Joe Tracy. This information makes Stokes a more likely suspect in the eyes of the investigators, and it also creates suspense by introducing a new potential suspect in the form of Joe Tracy.
