The scene takes place on board the X-21, a ship that is orbiting the earth. The pilot, McCauley, and the observer, Furness, are discussing their situation. They are low on fuel and their pilot chute is ripped, which makes it unlikely they will be able to land safely. However, they are determined to try. McCauley says that he would have done the same thing in Furness's position, and Furness is grateful. They continue to orbit the earth, waiting for their moment to attempt a landing.
