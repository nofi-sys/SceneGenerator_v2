In the scene, James Quentin is speaking with Helen Denis about Gilbert Lisle. He tells her that Lisle is a "queer, eccentric beggar" and that he is glad he is not in Lisle's shoes. He also mentions that Lisle is considered a "tremendous catch" by some people. Helen remains calm and indifferent throughout the conversation.

The literary style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The tone is one of polite conversation, and the point of view is that of an omniscient narrator.
