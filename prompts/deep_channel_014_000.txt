The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the city and the rooms where the characters will be staying. The author also establishes the relationship between the two characters.

-Julie Rose: a young woman who has recently left her old life behind and is starting anew with her companion, Timothy Bixby. She is described as being happy and carefree.
-Timothy Bixby: a man who has met and fallen in love with Julie Rose. He is described as being caring and protective of her.

Julie Rose slips out of her life in Harts Run and boards a train to Richmond, where she is met by Timothy Bixby. They have supper together in the station restaurant and then take a street-car to their new home, a small frame house in a poor part of town.
The rooms are close and the furniture is cheap and ugly, but Julie doesn't care. The porch is clothed with a cottage vine, and there are flowers in the tiny front yard.
Timothy takes her to a parkway at the edge of town, where they can see the James River and the open country beyond. He tells her that this is the jumping-off place, where she can come to stretch and breathe when things get too close on her back in the streets.
