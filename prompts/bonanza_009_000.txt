Mollie has moved into town and opened a small shop called the Back Home Kitchen, where she sells home-cooked food to miners. Her husband, Scot, has not spoken to her since the day after their daughter's funeral.
One day, Scot walks into the shop and sees Johnnie, a young man who is known to be a target for Farmer Peel. Johnnie is dressed in new clothes and getting his hair curled, and he tells Scot that he wants to look nice in case he is killed.
Sure enough, Farmer Peel comes into the shop and shoots Johnnie. He is arrested and fined, but before he can pay the fine, he gets drunk and goes back to the court to attack the judge.
The judge is taken to the hospital for repairs, and Virginia City just grins.

The style of this scene is humorous and light-hearted, with a touch of darkness. The point of view is third person omniscient.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the chaotic and dangerous nature of life in the American West during the gold rush. The author achieves this by describing the lawlessness and violence of the time, as well as the humor that people used to cope with their difficult circumstances.
