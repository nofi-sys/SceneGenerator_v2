A man is about to be hanged for killing his own baby and stabbing another man. Scot McClintock, who knows the man, tries to talk the mob out of it. When that doesn't work, he offers to take the man's place.

-Mollie: a woman who is married to a man she does not love and is considering leaving him
- Scot: a man who is trying to convince Mollie to leave her husband
- the crowd of men: a group of men who are planning to hang Dodson for killing his baby and stabbing Jerry Mulligan

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of foreboding.
