-Strike: the protagonist, a man who is engaged to Gerry

- Everyone is running from a hairy enemy on Neptune
- They eventually kill it with scalpels attached to a metal rod

- Strike is delighted that Gerry didn't figure it out sooner

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a touch of humor. The point of view is third person omniscient.
