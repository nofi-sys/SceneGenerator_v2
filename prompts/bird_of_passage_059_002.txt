In the scene, Helen is telling her husband-to-be that she is not a suitable wife for him. She explains that she is a lady, but has no money or connections. He tells her that she is going to listen to him, and that when he was a poor, obscure nobody at Port Blair, she accepted him as her future husband. He says that he does not care for Miss Calderwood, and that their estates just suit one another. Helen then tells him that her uncle is very odd, but that he was good to her. She also mentions that her cousin Katie is going to marry her cousin Barry. The husband-to-be then asks if Orson has ever dared to make love to her, and she says that he has not. She explains that she is at the gate because he defied her to come up and cut her name into it. He tells her that he saw her ghost yesterday in Terryscreen, and she confesses that it was actually her. She says that she had to play the part perfectly because her family is miserably poor.
