The scene opens with the train arriving at the Satuit Station, and the twelve children spilling out onto the platform. They are met by Botkins, the driver, who takes them to their limousine. The road stretches out before them, and they pass a farmhouse, a barn, a pond, a graveyard, and finally the town.
