The purpose of this scene is to establish conflict between the two main characters, Ruth and Mrs. Stovall. The author achieves this by having Mrs. Stovall confront Ruth about her behavior towards Norma Tait. Ruth is clearly uncomfortable with the conversation, which sets the stage for further tension between the two women.

Ruth is on the porch with Mrs. Stovall, who is speedily saying goodbye to a dark-eyed young woman. Mrs. Stovall introduces the woman as Mrs. Tait, an old friend, and Ruth is immediately jealous. She recalls the pain of her husband's affair with this woman and goes into the house, refusing supper.
Mrs. Stovall comes into Ruth's room, ignoring her protests, and tells her that Norma Tait is not responsible for the affair and that she should not be so highty-tighty. Ruth insists that she would rather not discuss Mrs. Tait, but Mrs. Stovall continues talking. She says that the story about Norma and Mac is a pack of lies and that she, Mrs. Stovall, was the one who asked Mac to drive Norma down to Wagon Wheel.
