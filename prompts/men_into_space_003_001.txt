-McCauley: the foreman of the Space Platform construction project; a gruff but competent leader
-Sammy Breen: a young man working on the Space Platform; inexperienced but eager to please
-An unnamed third character: mentioned as being present during the scene, but does not speak

The purpose of this scene is to establish the dangerous conditions of working on the Space Platform, and to show how one mistake can lead to disaster. The author also uses the scene to establish the character of McCauley as a competent and level-headed leader.

McCauley and Sammy Breen are working together on the Space Platform, bolting a beam in place. Sammy is using a reamer to cut through the metal, and McCauley is watching. Suddenly, the reamer gets stuck and Sammy yanks on it, causing himself to slide along the beam he's gripping. He reaches out to brace himself, and accidentally kicks the reamer loose. It floats away, and Sammy goes with it, tethered only by a space rope.
McCauley grabs the rope and tries to hold on, but he's pulled away from the Platform and starts spinning around Sammy. They're both drifting away from the Platform, and McCauley's own space rope is sliding off the beam they were working on. It catches and slides again, and then comes loose, leaving McCauley and Sammy drifting together toward the stars.
