-Carlin is the protagonist of the scene. He is a man from Canopus who is visiting Earth. He is tired and homesick when the scene begins, but feels better after a good night's sleep.
-Marn Land is the only other person in the scene. She is a girl from Earth who is helping Carlin get settled. She is friendly and helpful.

Carlin enters his bedroom to find it dark and is unable to find the light switch. He gets into bed and looks out the window, where he sees the spaceport beacons and the quarter-phase shield of Luna. He feels homesick and miserable, but eventually falls asleep. 
When he wakes up, he feels much better and is surprised to find that he slept well in the primitive bed. He hears birds outside and the air is pure and sweet. He gets dressed and goes downstairs, where he finds Marn Land. 
Marn tells him that Jonny and Harb have gone to the spaceport and are fixing up an old planet-ship for a trip to Mercury. Carlin eats breakfast, which is coarse but satisfying, and then goes for a walk. 
He feels at a loss without anything to do, but Marn tells him that he'll get used to it. He walks around the yard and finds Gramp fishing at the north brook.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the reader to the main character, Carlin. The author achieves this by describing the surroundings in detail and by showing Carlin's reaction to them.
