The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Miss Lane and to provide some background information on her current situation. The author also uses the opportunity to describe the setting in detail.

George goes to London to find his runaway brother, but instead finds Miss Lane's aunt. The aunt tells George that Miss Lane is living in London by herself and trying to get daily pupils. George is surprised by this news and wonders if it is a proper thing for a young girl to do.

The style of this scene is very formal and old-fashioned. The tone is somewhat stern and disapproving. The point of view is that of an omniscient narrator.
