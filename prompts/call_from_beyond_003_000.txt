The author is establishing the setting and introducing the protagonist. We learn that the protagonist is a man named West, who is landing on the planet Pluto. The scene also establishes that there is something strange going on on Pluto, with mysterious lights and a message from a dying man.

West lands his ship on the only landing strip on Pluto, in the shadow of the mountains. He sees the lights of the laboratory and heads in that direction. He remembers the message from the dying man, warning of something loose on the planet, and wonders if he will need his pistol. 
As he approaches the laboratory, he sees the massive structure of the shops of the Alpha Centauri expedition. He remembers that the crew of that expedition had given up and gone back to Earth, leaving behind their ship. He wonders if the ship is still there. 
West enters the laboratory and is immediately attacked by something. He shoots at it, but it is not vulnerable to his pistol. He is killed.
