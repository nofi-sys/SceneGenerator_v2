The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Mrs. Watkins and to foreshadow the conflict that Julie will face when she tries to help her.
The author achieves this by having Mrs. Watkins describe Mrs. Wheeler's appearance and behavior in negative terms. She also paints Mrs. Wheeler as a proud and difficult woman who is not likely to accept help from anyone.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its conversational tone and its use of dialect. The dialogue between the two characters reveals their different attitudes towards the woman they are discussing. Julie is sympathetic and wants to help, while Mrs. Watkins is more dismissive. This contrast creates a sense of tension and foreboding, as we wonder what will happen when Julie tries to talk to the woman.

Julie and Tim are sitting in the park, discussing Julie's recent lie to Mrs. Watkins. Julie is worried that she may have harmed their chances of staying in the house by telling Mrs. Watkins that they come from Harts Run instead of Red River. Tim reassures her, and they discuss the happiness they have found in each other. Julie then tells Tim about a notion she has had regarding their happiness. She says that she believes they are meant to be together, and that they will never be truly happy unless they are together.
