The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the characters of Archie and Sarah, and to establish the setting and conflict of the story. We learn that Archie is looking for work, and that he has finally found a job with a man named Mr. Glorie. However, we also learn that Mr. Glorie is a bit of a strange character, and that he is initiatin Archie into the "mysteries" of soapmaking. This conflict - between Archie's desire for a normal job and Mr. Glorie's eccentricities - will likely drive the rest of the story.

Archie signs an apprenticeship with Mr. Glorie to learn the soap-making trade. For a time, he is kept in the shop and learns to sell seidlitz powders and gum drops. Mr. Glorie then takes him into the back premises to initiate him into the mysteries of soap-making. He explains that his soap is transparent and will revolutionize the world of commerce.
