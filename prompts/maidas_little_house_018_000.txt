Maida is in a bad mood and doesn't want to talk to anyone. The other children in the house notice and try to get her to talk, but she is adamant. She eventually goes to her room and locks the door. Laura and Rosie go on a bike ride to give her some time alone.

The purpose of this scene is to establish Maida's character and to set up the conflict for the rest of the story. The author achieves this by showing Maida's sudden change in behavior from her normally happy self to a sullen, angry girl. This change in behavior is unexplained, which creates curiosity in the other characters and sets up the conflict for the story.
