The literary style of this scene is realistic, with a focus on the details of the setting and the conversation between the two characters. There is a sense of foreboding and tension in the air, as the two men discuss the nefarious plans of the Motor Company.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the City Railway Company and the Motor Company. The Motor Company is trying to steal the City Railway Company's franchise, and Mason is outraged. This sets up the rest of the story, in which Mason tries to stop the Motor Company from getting the franchise.

The scene opens with a group of weary horses dragging ponderous trucks homeward. The drivers are drooping and thinking about cans of beer. A red sun is throwing shafts of light along the cross-town streets and between the rows of black warehouses.
The porters have all gone for the night from Mason & Sons, and young Mason is about to lock the door when Kerrigan jumps from a passing car and hailed him.
Kerrigan says that he noticed Mason as he was passing by, and that this reminded him that he wanted to speak to him. Mason leads Kerrigan into the office.
Kerrigan explains that he drew up a will the other day in which Mason was named as executor. The will is for old Miss Cassidy, who used to keep house for Mason's father.
Mason is surprised to hear this, and asks why Miss Cassidy has made a will. Kerrigan explains that she is getting old and thought that the matter should be settled. He also mentions that there are rumours going about the City Hall that must interest a reformer like Mason. The rumours are that the Motor Traction Company is endeavouring to secure possession of Center and Line streets.
Mason asks if the Motor Company plans to purchase the rights of the new company. Kerrigan explains that they are not interested in doing this, but are instead trying to steal the rights.
The young attorney plants his back against the desk and braced himself with his elbows. He begins to give Kerrigan a sketch of the situation. The City Railway Company was duly chartered, secured the franchise from councils for these two streets and spent thousands of good dollars in putting down road-bed, rails and all that sort of thing. At this stage, the Motor Company suddenly discovered that Center and Line streets were arteries that would tap the thickly populated sections, and that the new company would reduce their earnings.
Under cover of a protest from citizens living along the line of the new road, an injunction was gotten out staying all work; the matter was carried into the courts, where it has been hanging fire ever since.
Mason is outraged to hear this, and exclaims that it is infamous. He asks how the road could be built in the time specified when the courts prevented their working upon it. Kerrigan shrugs his shoulders and explains that the Motor Company want that franchise and is not at all particular about how it is gotten.
The two young men rise and make their way to the sidewalk. As they are leaving, the square-jawed young teamster from the opening scene approaches them. He explains that the man who was mumbling incoherently is his brother, and that he is trying to get him to go home.
Mason and Kerrigan are sympathetic, and Mason offers to help the teamster get his brother home. The teamster is grateful, and the three men go off together.
