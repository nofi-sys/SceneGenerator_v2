The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Annie and Lilian, and to set up the conflict between them. Annie is shown to be a shy, nervous woman who is trying to make the best of her new life, while Lilian is a confident, outgoing woman who is not afraid to speak her mind. The conflict between them is established when Lilian asks Annie about her life on the stage, and Annie reveals that she is not happy with her new life.

Annie is at the train station, waiting to meet her sister-in-law, Lilian. She is nervous, as she is not sure how Lilian will react to her new position at the Grange. However, she is also excited to see Aubrey Cooke, an actor she is fond of, in the newspaper. When Lilian arrives, she is friendly and complimentary towards Annie. However, she is also surprised to learn that Annie was once an actress. Annie explains that she recognized Lilian in the audience during one of her performances. 
 Stephen, who is also present, makes a bolder comment than he would have in the past to Lilian. He notes that Harry, Annie's husband, can be a trial at times. Lilian laughs and says that husbands always have their quirks. 
At dinner that night, the two ladies are both dressed nicely. Lilian is in dark red velvet and Annie is in maize-colored silk. They discuss Lilian's desire to become an actress and Annie's experiences in the theater.

The style of this scene is light and conversational. The tone is friendly and gossipy, and the point of view is third person limited.
