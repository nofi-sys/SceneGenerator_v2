Alice Cramer is anxiously awaiting the arrival of her fashionable sister-in-law from San Francisco. When the sister-in-law arrives, she is accompanied by a beautiful young woman named Tibby Warings. Tibby is fascinated by the wild ponies on the Cramer property and chooses one named Tempest to be her own.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing objective description of the action and dialogue. There is a bit of authorial commentary on Alice's character and her anxiety about her sister-in-law's visit, but for the most part the focus is on what is happening and what the characters are saying. There is a bit of foreshadowing in the mention of Alice's "other visitors," which may be hinting at some sort of supernatural element to the story.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the characters of Alice Cramer, her sister-in-law Elinor, and Elinor's daughter Tibby. The scene also establishes the setting of the story and provides some background information on the characters.
