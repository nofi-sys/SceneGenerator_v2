The purpose of this scene is to show the deteriorating mental state of the protagonist, Jean. The author achieves this by showing Jean's increasing obsession with two thoughts, that he might have killed Flaubert and that he had not stayed with Gabrielle. Jean is also shown to be growing more and more restless, pacing up and down the music room. Cartier's attempts to engage Jean in conversation and get him to go out and hear Margot sing are unsuccessful. Jean is fixated on his own thoughts and is uninterested in anything else.

Jean is a young man who is struggling with his mental health. He is fixated on two things: the idea that he could have killed Flaubert, and the fact that he did not stay with Gabrielle. These thoughts consume him and he has difficulty sleeping or thinking of anything else.
Cartier, a friend of Jean's, tries to help him by taking him to hear Margot sing. Margot is a young woman who is also struggling with her mental health. She is fixated on the idea that she is not good enough to sing.
Cartier hopes that hearing Margot sing will help Jean to snap out of his funk, but Jean is not interested. He is too wrapped up in his own thoughts to pay attention to anything else.
