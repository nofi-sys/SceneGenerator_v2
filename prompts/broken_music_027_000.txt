-Flaubert: older man, enjoying his breakfast and grandeur
-Jean DUcelles: younger man, Flaubert's secretary; impatient and discomposing
-Mademoiselle Selba: woman who Jean represents; bill for four hundred francs
-Gabrielle Torialli: woman who Flaubert is involved with; different and extraordinary

In the scene, Flaubert is dictating correspondence to his younger secretary, Jean, in his breakfast room. Flaubert is interrupted by Jean, who has a bill from Margot and a walking stick with him. Flaubert tries to put off the business, but Jean insists, so Flaubert signs the receipt and Jean hands over the bill. Jean then tells Flaubert that he has come on behalf of Mademoiselle Selba and must take him to task. Flaubert tries to escape and hide under the table, but Jean grabs him and pulls him out. There is a struggle and a lot of china is broken. Suddenly, Gabrielle appears in the doorway and the scene changes.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Gabrielle Torialli and to set up the conflict between her and Jean DUcelles. The author achieves this by having Gabrielle interrupt a violent scene between Jean and Flaubert, with her presence having an immediate calming effect on the situation.
