The scene opens with the protagonist, Jim, and his friends discussing recent events. They are interrupted by the sound of horses, and they realize that the Kash Guard is coming. The leader, Brother General Or-tis, dismounts and tells Jim's wife, Juana, that he has chosen her to be his woman. Jim steps between them and tells Or-tis that Juana is his woman. Or-tis threatens Jim and tells him that he will have Juana in thirty days. Jim and Juana stand their ground, and Or-tis eventually leaves.

The literary style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is one of fear and danger. The characters are all on edge, waiting for the next move from the authorities.

4. Samuels: the old man chuckled, for he thought as I did that my ruse must have effectually baffled Johansenunless he had followed Moses farther than we guessed.
5. Jim: We were sitting thus in quiet and contentment enjoying a brief rest from our lives of drudgery, when we heard the pounding of horses hoofs upon the hard earth of the path that leads down the river in the direction of the market place.
6. Peter: Not once had Juana or I let our glances betray that we knew of Peters presence, though I could not help but see him dodge behind a tree the moment that he saw us.
