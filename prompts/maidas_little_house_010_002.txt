The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the Little Six and Silva Burle. The author achieves this by having the characters discuss Silva's strange behavior and by having Arthur reveal that he has been spying on her.

The scene opens with Rosie coming home angry and breathless. She tells Maida that she was walking along the path when she saw a little opening in the bushes. She thought it looked pretty, so she decided to cut into it. Just then, she saw Silva Burle running towards her. Silva had a bottle of milk under her arm. When Silva saw Rosie coming, she made a face at her and then disappeared into the bushes. Maida is perplexed, wondering why Silva would act so strangely towards them.
Arthur then tells a similar story of how he saw Silva running away from him, carrying a bundle of something under her arms. Laura tells a third story of how she got drenched with water after Silva sabotaged a trap she had set for her.
Maida ponders all this evidence, but she is unable to come up with a explanation for why the Burles seem to dislike them. Billy Potter is also at a loss.
Later, Arthur is talking to Mr. Westabrook about how he likes to explore the forest. Mr. Westabrook tells him that he should only do it on nights when the moon is full. Arthur agrees, and then Maida begs to be allowed to do it too. Mr. Westabrook says no, but he promises that they can do it sometime in the future.
