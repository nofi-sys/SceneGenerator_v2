The scene opens with Hi in the hut, feeling as though someone is there with him. He attributes this feeling to the way the light hits the hammock-post. He then notices a glint of light coming from the floor and finds a locket with a photo of a young woman inside. Hi assumes it belongs to the man who was in the hut earlier and puts it on the stool, intending to give it back when the man returns.
He then falls asleep and has a dream in which the man from the hut appears to him, looking sad. The man seems to be trying to tell Hi something, but he can't understand. Hi wakes up and realizes it was just a dream.
He then goes to the other hut, where D. W. is, and is introduced to Brocket Letcombe-Bassett. They have a meal of the stew Hi has been eating all day. Brocket is not a gracious host, and Hi gets the impression that he doesn't like him. Brocket tells Hi that he is looking for Carlotta.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of D.W., and to establish his relationship with Hi. The author also uses this scene to establish the setting and to provide some background information on the situation.
