-The shark: a scary creature that the boatman laughed at
-The boatman: laughed at the shark; has one oar and a boat hook
-The master: signed to the boatman not to lean over the side; polite to Hi
-Hi: noticed that they weren't getting any closer to La Boca; asked the master if they could row in to shore; watched Giordano's boat with envy
-Giordano: familiar figure in the other boat; helped by more than the sweeps; a better boat in light airs
-Chigo: watched Giordano's boat; laid aside his fender making when the breeze came
-The soldiers: watching the boat's approach; one is a white officer who Hi doesn't like

A boat carrying Hi and the master is becalmed and drifting back towards La Boca. Hi sees another boat, manned by Giordano, creeping down to La Boca under sweeps and becomes envious. The breeze finally picks up and they are able to continue on their way. However, they are now further from La Boca than when they started. Hi watches as Giordano's boat enters the harbour. Hi is met by Pituba soldiers, one of whom is a white detective. The detective begins questioning him.
