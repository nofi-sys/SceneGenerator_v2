Annie is a young woman who has recently joined a touring theater company. She is shy and doesn't want to live with the other members of the company, so she chooses to live alone. She has some trials with her lodgings, but the worst is when she arrives at a new town and finds that her landlady is always out and doesn't provide any services.
Aubrey Cooke, another member of the company, lives in the same building and is also having trouble with the landlady. He is tired and hungry after a long rehearsal when he runs into Annie. They commiserate with each other about the state of their lodgings and then go upstairs to their respective rooms.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the character of Annie. The author achieves this by describing the surroundings in which Annie lives and by giving a brief overview of her personality.

The style of this scene is rather formal and old-fashioned, possibly due to the time period in which it is set. There is a lot of dialogue, and the point of view is third person limited.
