Hi is jailed and finds himself in a room with two other drunkards. He
looks through the grating and sees that the town is on fire. He
wonders if they will be burned alive. The other drunkard wakes up and
Hi tells him what is happening. The drunkard tries to escape but is
unsuccessful.

- Hi: the protagonist, a young man who is thrust into a jail cell
- The officer: the man who orders Hi to be put in the cell
- The jailer: the man who leads Hi to the cell and locks him in
- The first drunkard: a man who is lying on the floor, passed out
- The second drunkard: a man who is sitting up and talking to Hi

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no attempt at poetic language or description, and the focus is on the events and dialogue. The tone is somewhat tense and anxious, as the protagonist is worried about being burned alive.
