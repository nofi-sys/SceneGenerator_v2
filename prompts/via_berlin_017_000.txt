The purpose of this scene is to provide the reader with information about the rebellion in Brazil and to suggest that there may be a connection between the rebellion and the Ouro Pretos' request to the Kaiser. The author achieves this by having Lillian Byrd write a letter to Rutile in which she provides information about the rebellion and her suspicions.

The style of this scene is journalistic. It is objective and matter-of-fact, with a focus on facts and evidence. There is no hint of opinion or bias.

In her letter, Lillian Byrd informs Rutile that she has been investigating the Ouro Pretos at his request, and has uncovered some potentially significant information. She reports that a rebellion has broken out in southern Brazil, led by the Ouro Pretos and a few other excitable Brazilians. She also reports that the rebellion appears to be receiving support from Germany, in the form of training and supplies.
