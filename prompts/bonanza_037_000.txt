The style of this scene is straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is no hint of drama or suspense, and the tone is calm and businesslike. The point of view is third person omniscient.

A group of armed men gather at the Pony Express Corral to plan a strategy to take back their mining claims from the Dodsons. Scot, the leader, explains that they will not be looking for trouble and that they do not want to kill anyone. The men agree and camp for the night.
