The captain orders his men to take Hi to the city hall in Ribote, where he will be interrogated.
Once at the city hall, the captain and his men go inside, leaving Hi with a few troopers. A few minutes later, there is a commotion from inside the hall, and shots are fired. The captain and his men come out, escorting three prisoners.
The captain then turns to Hi and orders him to dismount from his horse. Hi complies, and the captain tells him that he will be interrogated in the city hall.
