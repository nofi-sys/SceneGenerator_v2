Miss Denis is sitting on the steps of her bungalow, feeding a tame peacock, when she sees her father approaching with a visitor. She stands up and shyly greets them. The visitor is Mr. Lisle, who rescued her from the storm the previous week.
They all go inside and sit in the shady drawing room. Mr. Lisle compliments Miss Denis on her appearance and they make small talk. Sawmy brings in afternoon tea and they all enjoy a cup.
Miss Denis is tired of people asking her how she likes the island, but Mr. Lisle is interested in her opinion. She tells him that she loves it and has never been happier. They chat for a while longer before Mr. Lisle takes his leave.

- Mr. Lisle: a sunburnt man, of average height, with an artist's eye
- Miss Denis: a shy but pretty girl, with serene countenance and thick plaits in her hair
- Colonel Denis: Miss Denis's father, a hospitable man
- Sawmy: the servant who brings in afternoon tea
