The scene opens with the young people separating after breakfast. Jessie, Amy, and the two Stanley girls agree to explore Hackle Island together, with Henrietta as their guide. They soon reach the golf club grounds and then the patch of woods between the club and the hotel.
 Henrietta suddenly stops and says she hears somebody talking that she doesn't like. The others ask who it is, and Henrietta says it's the person who keeps saying she owns Hackle Island.
The group decides to investigate and soon comes upon Belle Ringold and Sally Moon. Belle is trying to convince Sally that she, Belle, is the rightful owner of Hackle Island.
The girls confront Belle and Sally, and Belle eventually backs down. The group then has their picnic lunch and heads back to the Norwood bungalow.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Henrietta and Belle Ringold. Belle is determined to get an invitation to sail on Darry's yacht, and Henrietta is determined to stop her. This conflict will drive the plot forward and create tension between the two characters.
