The man leads the way out of the village and across the river, to a narrow path through a cane-brake. The set of the path is to the south and west, which Hi knows cannot be the course for Santa Barbara. Hi says this can't be the way, and the man says it is. They walk in silence. The man is in front of Hi with the rifle, and Hi is thinking about how the man is going to kill him. He wonders if there is any way to stop him. They walk for some time, and Hi is getting tired. He thinks about how the man is stronger and faster than him, and how he will probably be killed if he tries to run or fight. He decides the best thing to do is to keep walking and hope for a chance to escape.
