-At Boxwell Hall, an audience is waiting for Mrs. Lucien to give a psychic reading.
-Major Walden is among the audience, and is visibly distressed.
-Nathan tries to calm him down, but Walden accuses him of knowing about the reading ahead of time and not telling him.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Mrs. Lucien and to establish her as a mysterious and otherworldly figure. The author achieves this by having her speak in a low, sympathetic voice and by having her described as "grace personified."
