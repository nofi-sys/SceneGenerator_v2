- It is February 18th, 1746 and two horsemen are galloping through the streets of Inverness
- They are bound to create a commotion as Inverness is Jacobite by instinct, but there is no pleasant flavour about the word "rebel"
- The good people of the town are at their wits' end to know which way to cry
- Rob Fraser, a schoolboy of 16, is a Jacobite beyond recall
- The two horsemen pull up their steaming beasts in the market place and the one who had lost his hat raised himself in his stirrups and shouted for silence
- The man cried, speaking in Gaelic, "for the Pretender's army is even now marching on your town."

1. Rob Fraser: a 16-year-old boy who is a Jacobite sympathizer; he is of slight build, with dark features and sombre eyes; he is a schoolboy but also a Fraser, and is therefore dignified in his bearing.
2. The two horsemen: they are both men, one of whom has lost his hat and the other his stirrup-irons; they are riding fresh, grass-fed horses; they are bound for Inverness with news of the Pretender's army.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the two main characters and to establish the setting and conflict. The author achieves this by describing the horsemen's reckless entrance into the town, and the commotion it causes. We learn that the town is divided in its allegiances, and that Rob Fraser is a Jacobite. This sets up the conflict that will drive the rest of the story.
