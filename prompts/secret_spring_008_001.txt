The scene opens with a description of the train journey to Lautenburg, which is described as clean and peaceful. However, the station is described as monstrous, and the protagonist is met by two large lackeys in black and gold livery. He is taken to his room, which is luxurious, and is given a letter from Major von Kessel, the tutor of Duke Joachim. The letter explains that the Major is unable to meet him due to hunting commitments, but that he will be received at a quarter to ten the following morning.
The protagonist then tests his new powers by ringing for his valet, Ludwig. He is unimpressed by Ludwig's appearance, but is pleased with the meal that is laid out for him. He is then given a detailed description of the palace, which is a combination of a Renaissance castle and a Louis Quatorze palace. The description is of the exterior of the palace.
