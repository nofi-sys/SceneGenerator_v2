-Nah-ee-lah: A woman who is leading Julian through a tunnel. She is from Laythe and is familiar with the tunnel, although she has only traversed it once before.
-Julian: A man who is following Nah-ee-lah through the tunnel. He is not from Laythe and is unfamiliar with the tunnel.
-The Kalkars: Men who are coming through the tunnel. They are unfamiliar to Nah-ee-lah and Julian.

- Scene takes place in a tunnel leading to the city of Laythe
- Two passageways diverge from the main tunnel
- Julian and Nah-ee-lah take the second passageway in order to hide from a group of approaching Kalkars
- They hope to avoid detection and make their way back to the main tunnel once the Kalkars have passed

The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a sense of foreboding. The point of view is third person limited, focusing on Julian's perspective. The tone is one of fear and danger.
