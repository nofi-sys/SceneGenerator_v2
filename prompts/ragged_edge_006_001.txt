The literary style of this scene is subdued and melancholy. The tone is respectful and somber, befitting a funeral. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Larry Murphy. The language is simple and straightforward.

The scene opens with the funeral of Larry Murphy's grandfather. The family and friends are gathered in the church, and the casket is being borne out by the pallbearers. As they go, Ferguson calls out the names of those who will walk in the cortege. Mrs. Kelly is angry that she and her husband are not being given the place of honor ahead of the casket, but she is eventually placated and they take their place in the procession.
As they walk, Larry Murphy recalls his father's funeral, which was much more subdued and lacking in pomp. He remembers being very young and crying bitterly. He thinks about how his grandfather could have spared some of his wealth to give his son a proper send-off, rather than waiting until death was upon him.
When they reach the graveside, the priest says a few words about the old man's life and deeds. After the pallbearers have drunk their wine and eaten their cake, they shake hands with Larry and leave. The Kellys stay until Johnnie Kerrigan tells them that Larry has inherited the entire property, and then they leave in a fury.
Larry and Mary are now alone. Mary is crying by the window, and Larry is standing by the stove, deep in thought. He is trying to think of something to say that will comfort her, but he can't seem to find the right words. He has been thinking about her a lot lately, and he hates to see her so upset. He recalls all the good things he has heard about her - her kindness, her gentle nature, her deep love for her faith. He knows he is not worthy of her, but he can't help but be drawn to her.
Finally, Mary speaks, breaking the silence. She says she knows Larry must have loved his grandfather very much, and she can tell by the way he talks about him that he was a good man. Larry is surprised and touched by her words, and he begins to cry. They comfort each other, and Larry feels grateful to have Mary in his life.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Larry Murphy and to set up the conflict between him and the Kelly family. The author achieves this by showing Larry's reaction to his grandfather's funeral and by introducing the Kelly family's anger at being left out of the will.
