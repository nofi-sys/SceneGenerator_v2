Two men intrude on Ferreira and Topham's train compartment, despite the Brazilians strenuous protests. Ferreira fumed, pouring out so swift a torrent of guttural German that Topham, good German scholar as he was, could not understand one word in five. The intruders, however, clearly understood very well. Scornfully indifferent at first, they soon roused to the assault and apparently gave back as good as he sent.

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its fast pace and sharp dialogue. The characters are constantly in motion, and their conversation is full of tension and conflict. There is also a sense of foreboding throughout the scene, as the characters discuss the dangers of travelling in Germany.

The purpose of this scene is to establish tension and conflict between the two main characters, Ferreira and Topham. The author achieves this by having the two men be forced to share a carriage with two German men, who are rude and disruptive. This conflict sets up the rest of the story, in which the two men are constantly at odds with each other.
