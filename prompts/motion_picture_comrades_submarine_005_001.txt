The scene takes place on a boat, at night, and the characters are discussing a light they see in the distance. They are trying to figure out what the light is and what it means. The conflict is established when the characters discuss the possibility that the light is coming from a sponging vessel anchored on the other side of the Key.

The scene opens with Ballyhoo Jones and Oscar discussing a light they have seen in the distance. Jack joins the conversation and they discuss the possibility that it is coming from a fire on another island. They agree that it is most likely coming from a vessel and decide to wait for Captain Shooks to come on deck to ask his opinion. 
When the light disappears, they speculate that the vessel has either gone behind the island or that the people on board have decided to turn off the light. 
As they continue to watch, they see another light flash up from the shore of the island and realize that there are people on the island after all. They discuss the possibility that the people are spongers or turtle fishermen. 
The scene ends with the boys speculating about the people on the island and what they might be doing there.
