The style of this scene is very flowery and over-the-top. Liane is described in very grandiose terms, and the whole scene has a very melodramatic feel to it.

Liane de Brances is a famous actress in Paris, known for her beautiful smile. Ten years ago, her smile was the talk of the city, but now it is a little hardened by age and use. Liane is self-conscious and aware of her own attractiveness, and uses it to her advantage.
Maurice, Liane's husband, has gone to the races, leaving her alone. Liane is not happy about this, as she feels she is always the one left behind.
Jean, a young man who has never seen a beautiful woman before, is entranced by Liane. She is dressed in a pale grey tea-gown and looks like she has just glided into the room. Liane is pleased by the attention and begins to flirt with Jean.
Liane tells Jean about her busy life and how she is always working. She complains about having to go back to her dressmaker's after lunch, as she is already running behind schedule. Liane is frustrated with her life and the people in it, but she continues to smile and charm Jean.
