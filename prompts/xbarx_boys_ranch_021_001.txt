The purpose of this scene is to advance the plot and to develop the characters. The author achieves this by having the mother tell the boys that their father is tired and by having the boys discuss the possibility that the rustlers went through Harvers Gully. This scene also reveals the boys' affection for their horses and their determination to catch the rustlers.

The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is told from an omniscient third person point of view, and the tone is fairly neutral. There is some tension created by the fact that the boys' father has not yet returned from his night ride, but overall the scene is fairly calm.

Teddy and Roy are awoken by their mother to take their sister Belle over to a friend's house. On the way, they discuss their father's return from the previous night and their plans to catch the rustlers. Teddy thinks he saw one of the rustlers the previous day. When they arrive at their destination, they say goodbye to their mother and set off.
