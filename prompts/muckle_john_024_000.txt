The scene opens with Rob travelling towards Glen Lyon, after having spent the night at a gipsy camp. He is accompanied by the gipsy chief, who tells him that the soldiers are looking for him and that he is in danger. They reach a small house on the other side of a burn, and the chief tells Rob that they will stop there for the night. He also mentions that the owner of the house, Invernenty, is no friend of the Macgregors.
