The children are playing in the woods when they suddenly hear a strange noise. They investigate and find that all their picnic lunch has disappeared. The noise grows louder and turns into a chorus of strange cries, so the children flee in terror. They eventually calm down and wonder what could have made the noise.

-Maida: Maida is the storyteller of the group. She is also the one who first notices the strange noise coming from the ground.
-Laura: Laura is one of the girls in the group. She is the first to admit she is hungry and is also the one who suggests that somebody might be playing a joke on them.
-Rosie: Rosie is another girl in the group. She is the one who suggests that the lunch might be brought back if they wait long enough.
-Harold: Harold is one of the boys in the group. He is the one who suggests that the noise might be coming from a crazy person.
