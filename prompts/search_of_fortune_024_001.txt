The scene opens with Bob and Archie discussing Bob's upcoming marriage to Sarah. Bob is excited about the event and has already made plans for a lavish celebration. Archie is surprised to learn that Bob has arranged for everything, including the parson, and that he has even bought his mother a gold watch.
The next day, Bob and his mother go out to buy the "bonnie things" for the wedding. They are a handsome pair and attract a lot of attention. Bob is very generous with his money, buying his mother a gold watch and chartering a whole flat for the week of the wedding.
The day before the wedding, Archie asks Bob for all the cash he has on hand. Bob obliges, emptying his pockets of a large amount of money. Archie counts it and puts some away, returning a portion to Bob.
That night, there is a thunderstorm that clears by morning. The next day is bright and cool, and the carriages arrive at the church on time. The horses are bedecked in favours and the peal from the church bells is merry.

The style of this scene is lighthearted and humorous. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is cheerful and optimistic.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Bob and Archie and to set up the conflict between them. Bob is established as a fun-loving, carefree character who is eager to spend money and enjoy himself. Archie is established as a more level-headed character who is trying to keep Bob from spending too much money.
