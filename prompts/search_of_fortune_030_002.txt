The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and matter-of-fact. There is no real attempt at poetic or flowery language, but rather a focus on clear description. The point of view is third person omniscient, allowing the reader to see into the thoughts of various characters. The tone is relatively calm and relaxed, befitting the scene of a group of men taking a break after a long day's work.

- horsemen make a wide detour to get between the bush and the mob of cows
- they build log fires around the herd to keep them contained through the night
- supper is more pleasant with the addition of tea
- Craig takes Archie on a walk to show him how to avoid alarming the cows
- they return to the fire where Bob is already asleep
- Archie can't fall asleep so he looks at the stars and thinks about home
- he eventually falls asleep but is woken up by the sound of footsteps
- it's just one of the men adding wood to the fire before he goes back to sleep
- in the morning they have breakfast and then start herding the cows again
