In the scene, Goose is talking to the grocer about getting married, and the grocer is not encouraging. He tells Goose that he will never make enough money in the milk business to support a wife, and that Annie will just have to stay home and help her mother with the work.
Larry and Kerrigan approach and Goose tells them about his difficulties. Kerrigan explains that he has just come from Miss Cassidy's, Annie's aunt's, house and that she has left a will that could help Goose.
The will states that if Annie marries someone who can provide for her, she will inherit a large sum of money. Larry and Kerrigan tell Goose about this and he is excited. They agree to keep it quiet until the next day.

The style of this scene is light-hearted and comedic. There is a lot of banter back-and-forth between the characters, and the overall tone is one of good-natured fun. The point of view is third person limited, and the focus is on Goose and Larry's conversation.
