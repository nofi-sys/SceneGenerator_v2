Alice Cramer is standing by the window of her home, eagerly awaiting the arrival of Mark, her fianc√©. She is nervous, as they had parted on bad terms, and she is also afraid, as she has disobeyed him. She remembers that he had commanded her not to speak with Professor Russell, but she has done so anyway.
Suddenly, she feels a chill in the air and imagines that she sees shadowy forms outside. These forms begin to take on a more distinct shape and move closer to her. She is paralyzed with fear and sinks to the floor.
At that moment, she hears the sound of heavy footsteps outside and the door opens. Someone enters the room and approaches her. There is a rushing sound in her ears and she faints.
