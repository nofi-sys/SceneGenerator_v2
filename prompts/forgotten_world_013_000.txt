Carlin is a spy who has discovered the Land brothers' plans to mine the sun for copper. He is caught by Marn, who is holding an atom-pistol to his back. Carlin manages to grab the gun from her and orders the brothers to back away. Jonny tries to calm the situation, explaining that they need the copper to revive their planet. Carlin is incredulous, but Jonny insists that they have no other choice.
