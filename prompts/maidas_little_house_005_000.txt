The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with Maida narrating her memories of the gypsies to the other children in a matter-of-fact way. However, there is a hint of mystery and suspense when the gypsies are first introduced, with Arthur asking questions and the children appearing a bit scared. This suspense is quickly dissipated, however, when Maida begins talking about the gypsies and it becomes clear that she knows them well.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the gypsy camp and its inhabitants. The author achieves this by having Maida describe the camp and its inhabitants to the other children.
