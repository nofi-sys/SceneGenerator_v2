The scene opens with Fay and Saidee Isaacs discussing their plans to find Harry Raymond. They decide to go to the nearest big port, Arendal, and if he's not there, to cross Norway during the day and try Stavanger. Fay describes Raymond as an American crook who apes the English.
They search the hotel registers for a sign of him, but with no luck. As the ship prepares to leave, Fay has one last idea and they hurry to the docks. They find Raymond and his companion just in time to board the ship.

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing objective description of the events. However, there is a bit of dialogue between Fay and Saidee Isaacs, which gives the reader some insight into their characters. Fay comes across as somewhat cocky and confident, while Saidee seems more reserved and curious.

The purpose of this scene is to establish the setting and to introduce the characters. The author achieves this by describing the scene in detail and by introducing the characters' dialogue.
