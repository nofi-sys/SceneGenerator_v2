The style of this scene is dramatic, with a touch of humor. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is tense and suspenseful.

The scene opens with the protagonist, Captain, telling Dartmoor that he is sad to hear that Dartmoor and Miss Ewing are getting married. He recalls when he was in love with her and how he had left her ten years ago to go explore. Captain tells Dartmoor that he is getting old and that his hair is turning gray. Dartmoor says that he is being interfered with by a local society for the prevention of cruelty to children and that he is in danger of arrest. Captain tells Dartmoor to take his living dead man to his island where he is the law and the lawmaker. Dartmoor is interested and asks Captain about his pearl fishery and the gang of coolies who obey him. Captain then goes to see Miss Ewing. He tells her that he is still in love with her and that Dartmoor is only marrying her because he needs her. Miss Ewing almost agrees to leave Dartmoor, but then Dartmoor comes in. He tells them that he has a proposition for Captain to take him and his living dead man to the island. He also says that he will need to postpone the wedding.
