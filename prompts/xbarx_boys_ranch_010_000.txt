Teddy Manley is standing with his back to the wall, arms outstretched, watching a mountain lion. The lion is standing firm and steady, but its tail is lashing back and forth. Teddy's brain is overcome with fear and he reaches for his gun. He jumps to the side and points the gun at the lion. The lion does not attack, but Teddy's thoughts are racing. He wonders if he should shoot, and if so, whether or not the lion will charge. He decides to wait and see if the lion will leave on its own. The lion's tail stops lashing and its shoulder muscles move. Teddy knows the moment has come. He fires, but only wounds the lion. The lion attacks, and Teddy shoots again, hitting it below the heart. The lion is furious with pain and charges at Teddy. Teddy abandons his gun and advances toward the lion, fists clenched and eyes burning. The lion hesitates at the strange sight of an unarmed boy coming toward it, but then attacks. Teddy braces himself for the impact. He hears two sharp cracks and then the lion is dead.
