The style of this scene is formal and somewhat stilted. The dialogue is stiff and the characters seem to be speaking in a very formal, polite manner. There is a sense of tension and unease underlying the conversation.

- Frederick Walcheren: dark hair, long for the fashion, dull and damp with sweat, olive complexion, yellow and waxen, features pinched, eyes sunken
- Philip (cousin): arm around Frederick, supportive
- Mr Procter (coroner): impatient, not to be taken in by Frederick's story
- Jane Emily Walcheren (deceased): Frederick's wife, last seen alive on Saturday morning

In the scene, Frederick Walcheren is being questioned by the jury about the death of his wife, Jane Emily Walcheren. He explains that he saw her last on Saturday morning at the Castle Warden Hotel and left her to go for a swim. He didn't return until nearly three and says he was in the water for most of that time. Mr Procter is skeptical and points out that it is unusual for a bridegroom to leave his bride alone so soon after their wedding.
