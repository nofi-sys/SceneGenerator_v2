Jack, the protagonist, is a sailor on a ship. He is in the port forecastle, where he has been carried by his shipmates. He is sitting on a chest, just recovering his senses, and looking about in a dazed manner out of swollen and blackened eyes. As the men parted to make way for the doctor, Jack's mighty voice sounded from amidships: "Weather main-brace, here. Where's the watch? Where's the second mate? Attend to your yards, sir."
The doctor begins to treat the sailor, who is named Jim. Jim tells the doctor that he is on the water again and he is going to drown. The doctor tells Jim that he is the twin brother of Jack, and that they all thought he was dead. Jim says that he was saved from the water and he has been crazy ever since.
The doctor goes to talk to Jack and his mother on the poop. Jack tells the doctor that he is all right, but he went into a blue funk over something. The doctor tells Jack that he will have to think it out.

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of Jim, the protagonist's long-lost twin brother. The author achieves this goal by revealing Jim's backstory and showing the contrast between him and his brother.
