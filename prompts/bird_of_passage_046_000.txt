The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of irony or humor, and the tone is quite serious. The point of view is third person omniscient.

Helen is on her way to visit her uncle in Crowmore when she is unexpectedly delayed in Dublin. She eventually arrives in Bansha, where she is met by the local porter who informs her that her uncle's house is six miles away. When she asks how she is to get there, he suggests that she take a ride on the local mail car with Larry Flood. Helen is hesitant, as she has heard stories about Larry and his wild ways, but decides that it is her best option.
 Larry arrives soon after in a rickety old car pulled by a wild-looking chestnut horse. The horse is known locally as Finnigan's Mare, and is said to be dangerous. Larry offers to give Helen a ride to her uncle's house, and she reluctantly accepts.
The ride is a bumpy one, and Helen is constantly afraid that the horse is going to bolt. She is relieved when they finally arrive at her uncle's house in one piece.
