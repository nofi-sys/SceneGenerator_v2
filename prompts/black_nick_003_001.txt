- A hussar captain, Adrian Schuyler, is galloping along a road in the mountains when he meets a stranger.
- The stranger is a sulky-looking man, and when asked, says he is a peaceable farmer.
- Adrian is suspicious of the man and orders him to drop his gun.
- The man obeys but is still armed with a knife, so Adrian orders him to drop his belt too.

1. The Indian - a silent, stoic figure who plunges into the forest on a mission
2. The recluse - a curious hermit who lives in the mountains and is armed with a rifle
3. The hussar captain - a young, arrogant officer on horseback, armed with a pistol and a saber
4. The sullen stranger - a gruff, uncooperative man who is armed with a rifle and a knife

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of the hussar captain as a no-nonsense military man who is not to be trifled with. The author also establishes the character of the recluse as a sullen and surly individual.
