- Muckle John is in a cave with three other men, all in Highland dress and armed
- They are playing cards silently when the boy watching the hillside alerts them of someone's approach
- Muckle John nods to the men as they salute him, and then lies down to think
- After an hour, he comes up with a plan to write a letter to Dr. Archibald Cameron, pretending to be Rob Fraser
- He instructs one of the men, Donald Grant, to take the letter to Cameron and bring him back to the cave
- He also gives a second strip of tartan to John Murray of Broughton as a warning from one he knows well

1. Miss Macpherson: a young woman, likely in her early 20s. She is pretty and has a kind face. She is also very brave.
2. Muckle John: a large, burly man in his early 30s. He has a wild look in his eyes and is very fierce.
3. The three men in the cave: they are all Highlanders, in their kilts and armed with swords. They are silent and seem to be used to Muckle John's moods.
