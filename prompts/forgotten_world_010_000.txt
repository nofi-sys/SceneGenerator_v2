-Carlin: protagonist, injured man with a twisted subconscious who is staying on Earth to recuperate
-Marn: Carlin's caretaker, daughter of the family he is staying with; Carlin finds her attractive
-Jonny Land: one of the three lanky young men, Carlin's partner in the prospecting expedition

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no real sense of drama or suspense, and the tone is fairly calm and relaxed. The point of view is third person limited, and we only see things from Carlin's perspective.

The scene takes place at a spaceport on Earth, where the protagonist Carlin is accompanying Marn to pick up her brother Jonny. Carlin reflects on how much he has come to like Earth, despite its crudities, and on the importance of copper to the planet's economy. He also notices the Monument to the Space-Pioneers and reads the names of the men who first explored space.
