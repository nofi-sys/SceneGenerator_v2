- Frederick: a young man, rather vain, who is considering becoming a priest
- Rhoda: a sensible woman who is deeply attached to Frederick; she has "the gift of second sight"
- the soothsayer: a woman with a familiar spirit, condemned by Frederick's religion
- Mother: Rhoda's mother, a woman with the gift of second sight

- Rhoda visits Frederick to warn him about a man who is his enemy
- Frederick is upset that Rhoda is getting her information from a soothsayer
- Rhoda is adamant that her mother is not evil and that she trusts her
- Frederick and Rhoda agree to disagree about the matter

The tone of this scene is tense and argumentative. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Rhoda's perspective. The style is direct and straightforward.
