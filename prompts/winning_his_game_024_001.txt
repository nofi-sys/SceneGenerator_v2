Dud: determined, athletic
Jimmy: pessimistic, overweight

Dud and Jimmy are trying to figure out how to get to Greenbank in time for a baseball game. The train won't get them there in time, so they consider walking, but realize it will take too long. They consider renting a carriage, but the livery stable has no one to drive it. They finally decide to walk, and set off down the road.

The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is written in third person point of view, and the tone is fairly matter-of-fact. There is some dialogue, but it is mostly exposition.
