Fay is released from Dartmoor prison and heads to London. He is tired and paranoid, feeling that he is being followed. He stops at a coffee house to rest and gather his thoughts. He then proceeds to Soho Square and Burlington Arcade. He comes to a stop at a hotel and takes a moment to refresh himself and plan his next move. He memorizes the details of Saidee's diagram of the embassy and then destroys the evidence. He knows he needs to find a certain shop on Ludgate Street to get the tools he needs for his next job. He walks around, stopping at various windows, before finally finding the shop. He goes in and asks for what he needs. The shopkeeper is hesitant, but Fay is able to convince him and pays for the items. He then leaves the shop and heads back to the hotel to rest and plan his next move.
