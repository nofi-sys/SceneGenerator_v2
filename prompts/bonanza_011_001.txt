The purpose of this scene is to create suspense and fear in the reader. The author achieves this by having the characters experience strange and unexplainable events. These events are later revealed to be a prank, but the characters do not know that at the time. This leaves them feeling scared and confused.

The scene opens with Dutch, a gunfighter, inside a cabin, taking off his coat. There is a knock at the window, and Dutch immediately draws his gun. He fires, but there is no one there. The knocking moves to the other window, and Dutch fires again. He then rushes to the window to see if anyone is there, but there is no one there alive or dead. Suddenly, they hear a scream that sounds like a banshee. Dutch is terrified, and Buckley, his companion, tries to comfort him. The scream sounds again, and Dutch is convinced that it is the ghost of Al Morford, a man he killed. Buckley tries to get Dutch to leave with him, but Dutch is too scared. Finally, Buckley manages to get Dutch to leave with him, and they run away from the cabin. As they are leaving, they hear laughter that sounds like it is coming from the ghost of Al Morford.
