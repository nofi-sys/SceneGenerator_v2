The scene opens with Roy and Teddy in a canoe, trying to paddle after Joe Marino, who they saw on the shore. However, the current is too strong and they soon realize that they won't be able to catch up to him. Bug Eye, who was also in the canoe, asks what happened and they explain that they saw Joe Marino on the stolen horse and tried to catch him but failed. They all agree that there's no use in trying to land now and they turn back. On the way back, they discuss the possibility of Joe Marino being followed by a waddy, but they dismiss the idea. They eventually make it back to shore and the scene ends.
