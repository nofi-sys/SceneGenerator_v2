Bulstrode tells Elizabeth that her husband's illegitimate son, Hilary, may inherit a large sum of money from his father, Richard Skelton. Elizabeth is excited at the prospect of her family becoming rich, but Bulstrode warns her that if Skelton finds out about their conversation, he will be sure to cut Hilary off from the inheritance.
Later that night, Elizabeth tells her husband about the conversation with Bulstrode. Blair is immediately interested in the possibility of getting their hands on the inheritance, and he suggests that they try to blackmail Skelton into giving them a share.

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the possible future benefits for Elizabeth and her family if Bulstrode's secret is never revealed. By telling Elizabeth about the secret, Bulstrode has put her in a position to potentially blackmail Richard Skelton for a large sum of money.

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and straightforward. There is no hint of drama or suspense, and the tone is relatively calm. The point of view is third person omniscient.
