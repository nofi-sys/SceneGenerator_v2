The literary style of this scene is very dreamlike and romantic. The narrator is very enamored with the woman he sees, and he describes her in very flowery language. The tone is very longing and wistful, and the point of view is first person.

A large circle with an emerald in the form of a star is set in gold. A woman tells a man that he is only seeing what he wants to see, and that the ring he is looking at is only in his imagination. The woman then describes how she lost the ring in a room in the chateau, and the man is filled with despair at the thought of never seeing her again. The woman tells him that he will see her again, but only when he is worthy, and the man is then confronted by two ghosts who tell him to submit. The man is left alone, and he goes up to his room where he finds Baptiste. Baptiste tells him that he has never seen him wear a ring, and the man realizes that he is still dreaming.
