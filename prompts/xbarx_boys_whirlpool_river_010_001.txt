The scene opens with Roy and Teddy arguing about what to do with The Pup, the man they are chasing. Bug Eye interjects to say that The Pup is not worth the effort, but Teddy is adamant that they need to get their father's money back. The three men are in a canoe, paddling downstream, and they discuss the possibility of seeing The Pup again. Teddy is in favor of shooting him, but Roy vetoes the idea, saying that they need to keep their guns dry and clean. The three men continue paddling in silence until they reach a small cove, which they decide to make camp for the night. Teddy stretches and comments on how difficult it is to live in a canoe, and Roy jokes about living in a suitcase. The two brothers discuss the idea of fishing with a rifle, and Pop cackles sarcastically.
