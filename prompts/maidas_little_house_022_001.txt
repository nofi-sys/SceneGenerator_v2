Silva and her brother Tyma have been keeping Nesta, a baby, in a cave for a month. They stole her from Silva's father. Maida finds out and goes to the cave to rescue her. Silva tells her that they were going to sell baskets at the Warneford Fair but had to stay with the baby, so Tyma went instead. Aunt Save is telling fortunes at the fair.
