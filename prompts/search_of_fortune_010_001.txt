-Archie: young boy, rider of Scallowa the Shetland pony
-Mousa: a demon sheep that Archie loves
-Lord Glendale: a young, white Chillingham bull with black muzzle and crimson ears; full of mischief
-Branson: man helping to pen the bull
-Scallowa: Archie's Shetland pony

- In a field always dwelt one particular sheep, who was tall, lank, and daft-looking, and full of mischief
- The young Chillingham bull was as beautiful as a dream, but also full of mischief
- It was determined that Lord Glendale should be removed from Westfield, and Archie rode into the west field on Scallowa to help
- The plan was to get the baby-bull in the centre of the other cattle, manoeuvre so as to keep him there, and so pen all together
- However, Lord Glendale was on particularly good terms with himself this morning and decided to examine the little horse _inside_ as well as out
- Archie pretended, however, to take no notice and just as the bull was preparing for the rush he laughed derisively, flicked Lord Glendale with the whip, and started
- Now the play began in earnest, and away went Archie on Scallowa, with the bull in hot pursuit

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Lord Glendale and to foreshadow the events to come. The author achieves this by showing the reader how mischievous and dangerous the young bull is, and how he is a threat to both the other animals and to the people on the estate.
