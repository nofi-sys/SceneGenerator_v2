The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful, with a hint of mystery. The point of view is third person limited, and the tone is serious and dramatic.

-Carlin: a CE (control engineer) from the Sun-mining operations on Mercury; disbelief hardened his voice
-Marn: one of the young Earthmen; she is convinced that Jonny knows what he's doing
-Jonny Land: a young Earthman; he is crippled and has a thin face; he is very emotional
-Ross Floring: a man from Control Operations; he is suspicious of Jonny's plans
