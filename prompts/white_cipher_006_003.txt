The scene is set on a ship bound for Stavanger, Norway. Fay, a professional gambler, is aboard, and he is thinking about the two Greeks he met on the ship - cardsharps who are also on their way to Stavanger. He reflects on how they have changed since he last saw them, noting that the only difference is that they are now wearing smoked glasses. He wonders why they are going to Stavanger, and speculates that it is because few Greeks go there.
As the ship nears port, Fay is lost in thought, and he doesn't notice the man in the pea-jacket who is steering the ship. The man in the pea-jacket is focused on the task at hand, and he doesn't see the Greek cardsharps either. The ship hits a mud spit and starts to go off course, but the man in the pea-jacket steers it back on track.
Finally, the ship arrives in port and Fay goes to his cabin. He reflects on all that has happened during the voyage, and he makes a note of a few things that could be important for the cipher quest he is on.
