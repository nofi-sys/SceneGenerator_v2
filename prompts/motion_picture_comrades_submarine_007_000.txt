The style of this scene is tense and suspenseful. The point of view is from the perspective of the three boys on board the submarine, and the tone is one of anxiety and fear.

-Jack: one of the three main characters, a boy who is excited about the prospect of finding a sunken ship
-Ballyhoo: one of the three main characters, a boy who is skeptical about the whole endeavor
-Oscar: one of the three main characters, a boy who is optimistic and excited about the prospect of finding treasure
-the skipper: the captain of the submarine, who is steering the vessel through the waters
-the crew: the men who work on the submarine and are not involved in the conversation between the three boys

The submarine hits something hidden among the waving, giant water ferns, causing the engines to stop working. The boys are worried they won't be able to rise to the surface again and will suffocate.
