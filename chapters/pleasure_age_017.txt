Mr. Waine made an awkward slap at something on his leg before answering.

"Special meeting, Charley," he said grimly. "Something came up."

"What?"

Mr. Waine slapped again.

"These--these things, whatever they are. They're eating us alive."

"Oh!" Mr. Ashton beamed suddenly, and held up his swatter. "You need
one of these. I'll show you."

He began to chase one of the mosquito-like insects around the room,
while the Committee members watched in bewilderment. Finally Mr. Ashton
caught and killed another insect.

"There!" he cried triumphantly. "See. That's the way to fix them."

"Where did you get that gadget?" Mr. Waine asked.

"Made it."

"You _made_ it?"

Mr. Ashton glowed at the tone of Mr. Waine's exclamation. He held up
the swatter again.

"I made it," he repeated and added confidingly, "it was fun. You can
really smack 'em down with this."

"How long did it take you to make it?" asked one of the other members.

"It didn't take long," Mr. Ashton said with even more satisfaction.
"Not even an hour, did it?" He appealed to Mrs. Ashton.

"Will you make one for me?" Mr. Waine pleaded.

"And me. And me," the other members echoed.

Mr. Ashton hesitated.

"Well, I--I don't know."

Riley interrupted in a low voice.

"Make a trade with them."

"A trade?"

"Sure. You don't like being on the Committee, do you?"

"Oh!" Mr. Ashton understood suddenly. He turned to the television
screen. "Tell you what, Waine. You arrange it so I don't have to serve
on the Committee and I'll make one for you."

Mr. Waine was electrified by inspiration. He held up his hand for
silence.

"I've just thought of something," he announced importantly. "Everyone's
going to need one of those things, what with these--these--" he waved
his hand helplessly, at a loss for a word to describe the mosquito-like
insects. "Anyway, everyone's going to want one. Let's all make them and
trade them to the other citizens. Then, won't any of us have to be on
the Committee."

"Excellent. A splendid idea," Mr. Ashton chortled. And the other
members echoed, "Excellent. Splendid."

"I invented it," Mr. Ashton said. "I'll run the organization. We'll
call it--let's see--we'll call it the Ashton Swatter Company. ASC for
short."

"Excellent," said the members. "Splendid."
