Archie went straight away down from that boy's room feeling every
inch a man, and had an interview with his father and uncle.

It is needless to relate what took place there, or to report the
conversation which the older folks had that evening in the little
green parlour.  Both father and uncle looked upon Archie's request as
something only natural.  For both these men, singular to say, had
been boys once themselves; and, in the Squire's own words, Archie was
a son to be proud of.

"We can't keep the lad always with us, mother," said Squire
Broadbent; "and the wide world is the best of schools.  I feel
certain that, go where he will, he won't lose heart.  If he does, I
should be ashamed to own him as a son.  So there!  My only regret is,
Ramsay, that I cannot send the lad away with a better lined pocket."

"My dear silly old brother, he will be better as he is.  And I'm
really not sure that he would not be better still if he went away, as
many have gone before him, with only a stick and a bundle over his
shoulder.  You have a deal too much of the Broadbent pride; and
Archie had better leave that all behind at home, or be careful to
conceal it when he gets to the land of his adoption."

The following is a brief list of Archie's stock-in-trade when he
sailed away in the good ship _Dugong_ to begin the world alone: 1. A
good stock of clothes.  2. A good stock of assurance.  3. Plenty of
hope.  4. Good health and abundance of strength.  5. A little nest
egg at an Australian bank to keep him partly independent till he
should be able to establish a footing.  6. Letters of introduction,
blessings, and a little pocket Bible.

His uncle chose his ship, and sent him away round the Cape in a good
old-fashioned sailing vessel.  And his uncle went to Glasgow to see
him off, his last words being, "Keep up your heart, boy, whatever
happens; and keep calm in every difficulty.  Good-bye."

Away sailed the ship, and away went Archie to see the cities that are
paved with gold, and whose houses have roofs of solid silver.
