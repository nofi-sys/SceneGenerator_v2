One morning, shortly after the arrival of the first great herd of
stock, word was brought to head-quarters that the cattle had escaped
by stampede, and were doubtless on their way to the distant station
whence they had been bought.

It was no time to ask the question, Who was in fault?  Early action
was necessary, and was provided for without a moment's hesitation.

I rather think that Archie was glad to have an opportunity of doing a
bit of rough riding, and showing off his skill in horse management.
He owned what Bob termed a clipper.  Not a very handsome horse to
look at, perhaps, but fleet enough and strong enough for anything.
As sure-footed as a mule was this steed, and as regards wisdom, a
perfect equine Solomon.

At a suggestion of Bob's he had been named Tell, in memory of the
Tell of other days.  Tell had been ridden by Archie for many weeks,
so that master and horse knew each other well.  Indeed Archie had
received a lesson or two from the animal that he was not likely to
forget; for one day he had so far forgotten himself as to dig the
rowel into Tell's sides, when there was really no occasion to do
anything of the sort.  This was more than the horse could stand, and,
though he was not an out-and-out buck-jumper, nevertheless, a moment
after the stirrup performance, Archie found himself making a voyage
of discovery, towards the moon apparently.  He descended as quickly
almost as he had gone up, and took the ground on his shoulder and
cheek, which latter was well skinned.  Tell had stood quietly by
looking at him, and as Archie patted him kindly, he forgave him on
the spot, and permitted a remount.

Archie and Bob hardly permitted themselves to swallow breakfast, so
anxious were they to join the stockmen and be off.

As there was no saying when they might return, they did not go
unprovided for a night or two out.  In front of their saddles were
strapped their opossum rugs, and they carried also a tin billy each,
and provisions, in the shape of tea, damper, and cooked corned beef;
nothing else, save a change of socks and their arms.

Bob bade his wife a hurried adieu, Archie waved his hand, and next
minute they were over the paddocks and through the clearings and the
woods, in which the trees had been ring-barked, to permit the grass
to grow.  And such tall grass Archie had never before seen as that
which grew in some parts of the open.

"Is it going to be a long job, think you, Bob?"

"I hardly know, Archie.  But Craig is here."

"Oh, yes, Gentleman Craig, as Mr. Winslow insists on calling him!
You have seen him."

"Yes; I met him at Brisbane.  And a handsome chap he is.  Looks like
a prince."

"Isn't it strange he doesn't rise from the ranks, as one might say;
that he doesn't get on?"

"I'll tell you what keeps him back," said Bob, reining his horse up
to a dead stop, that Archie might hear him all the easier.

"I'll tell you what keeps him back now, before you see him.  I
mustn't talk loud, for the very birds might go and tell the fellow,
and he doesn't like to be 'minded about it.  He drinks!"

"But he can't get drink in the Bush."

"Not so easily, though he has been known before now to ride thirty
miles to visit a hotel."

"A shanty, you mean."

"Well, they call 'em all hotels over here, you must remember."

"And would he just take a drink and come back?"

Bob laughed.

"Heaven help him, no.  It isn't one drink, nor ten, nor fifty he
takes, for he makes a week or two of it."

"I hope he won't take any such long rides while he is with us."

"No.  Winslow says we are sure of him for six months, anyhow.  Then
he'll go to town and knock his cheque down.  But come on, Craig and
his lads will be waiting for us."

At the most southerly and easterly end of the selection they met
Gentleman Craig himself.

He rode forward to meet them, lifting his broad hat, and reining up
when near enough.  He did this in a beautifully urbane fashion, that
showed he had quite as much respect for himself as for his employers.
He was indeed a handsome fellow, and his rough Garibaldian costume
fitted him, and set him out as if he had been some great actor.

"This is an awkward business," he began, with an easy smile; "but I
think we'll soon catch the runaways up."

"I hope so," Bob said.

"Oh, it was all my fault, because I'm boss of my gang, you know.  I
ought to have known better, but a small mob of stray beasts got among
ours, and by-and-by there was a stampede.  It was dirty-dark last
night, and looked like a storm, so there wouldn't have been an ounce
of use in following them up."

He flicked his long whip half saucily, half angrily, as he spoke.

"Well, never mind," Bob replied, "we'll have better luck next, I've
no doubt."

Away they went now at a swinging trot, and on crossing the creek they
met Craig's fellows.

They laid their horses harder at it now, Bob and Archie keeping a bit
in the rear, though the latter declared that Tell was pulling like a
young steam-engine.

"Why," cried Archie at last, "this beast means to pull my arms out at
the shoulders.  I always thought I knew how to hold the reins till
now."

"They have a queer way with them, those bush-ranging horses," said
Bob; "but I reckon you'll get up to them at last."

"If I were to give Tell his head, he would soon be in the van."

"In the van?  Oh, I see, in the front!"

"Yes; and then I'd be lost.  Why these chaps appear to know every
inch of the ground.  To me it is simply marvellous."

"Well, the trees are blazed."

"I've seen no blazed trees.  Have you?"

"Never a one.  I say, Craig."

"Hullo!" cried the head stockman, glancing over his shoulder.

"Are you steering by blazed trees?"

"No," he laughed; "by tracks.  Cattle don't mind blazed trees much."

Perhaps Bob felt green now, for he said no more.  Archie looked about
him, but never a trail nor track could he decipher.

Yet on they rode, helter-skelter apparently, but cautiously enough
for all that.  Tell was full of fire and fun; for, like Verdant
Green's horse, when put at a tiny tree trunk in his way, he took a
leap that would have carried him over a five-bar-gate.

There was many a storm-felled tree in the way also and many a dead
trunk, half buried in ferns; there were steep stone-clad hills,
difficult to climb, but worse to descend, and many a little rivulet
to cross; but nothing coidd interfere with the progress of these
hardy horses.

Although the sun was blazing hot, no one seemed to feel it much.  The
landscape was very wild, and very beautiful; but Archie got weary at
last of its very loveliness, and was not one whit sorry when the
afternoon halt was called under the pleasant shade of trees, and
close by the banks of a rippling stream.

The horses were glad to drink as well as the men, then they were
hobbled, and allowed to browse while all hands sat down to eat.

Only damper and beef, washed down by a billyful of the clear water,
which, strange to say, was wonderfully cool.

When the sun was sinking low on the forest-clad horizon, there was a
joyful but half-suppressed shout from Craig and his men.  Part of the
herd was in sight, quietly browsing up a creek.

Gentleman Craig pointed them out to Archie; but he had to gaze a
considerable time before he could really distinguish anything that
had the faintest resemblance to cattle.

"Your eye is young yet to the Bush," said Craig, laughing, but not in
any unmannerly way.

"And now," he continued, "we must go cautiously or we spoil all."

The horsemen made a wide detour, and got between the bush and the
mob; and the ground being favourable, here it was determined to camp
for the night.  The object of the stockmen was not to alarm the herd,
but to prevent them from getting any farther off till morning, when
the march homewards would commence.  With this intent, log fires were
built here and there around the herd; and once these were well alight
the mob was considered pretty safe.  All, however, had been done very
quietly; and during the live-long night, until grey dawn broke over
the hills, the fellows would have to keep those fires burning.

Supper was a more pleasing meal, for there was the addition of tea;
after which, with their feet to the log fire--Bob and Craig enjoying
a whiff of tobacco--they lay as much at their ease, and feeling every
whit as comfortable, as if at home by the "ingleside."  Gentleman
Craig had many stories and anecdotes to relate of the wild life he
had had, that both Archie and Bob listened to with delight.

"I'll take one more walk around," said Craig, "then stretch myself on
my downy bed.  Will you come with me, Mr. Broadbent?"

"With pleasure," said Archie.

"Mind how you step then.  Keep your whip in your hand, but on no
account crack it.  We have to use our intellect versus brute force.
If the brute force became alarmed and combined, then our intellect
would go to the wall, there would be another stampede, and another
long ride to-morrow."

Up and down in the starlight, or by the fitful gleams of the log
fires, they could see the men moving like uneasy ghosts.  Craig spoke
a word or two kindly and quietly as he passed, and having made his
inspection, and satisfied himself that all was comparatively safe, he
returned with Archie to the fire.

Bob was already fast asleep, rolled snugly in his blanket, with his
head in the hollow of his upturned saddle; and Archie and Craig made
speed to follow his example.

As for Craig, he was soon in the land of Nod.  He was a true Bushman,
and could go off sound as a bell the moment he stretched himself on
his "downy bed," as he called it.

But Archie felt the situation far too new to permit of slumber all at
once.  He had never lain out thus before; and the experience was so
delightful to him that he felt justified in lying awake a bit, and
looking at the stars.  The distant dingoes began to howl, and more
than once some great dark bird flew over the camp, high overhead, but
on silent wings.

His thoughts wandered away over the thousands and thousands of miles
that intervened between him and home, and he began to wonder what
they were all doing at Burley; for it would be broad daylight there,
and very likely his father was trudging over the moors, or through
the stubbles.  But dreams came and mingled with his waking thoughts
at last, and were just usurping them all when he became conscious of
the approach of stealthy footsteps.

He lay perfectly still, though his hand sought his ready revolver;
for stories of black fellows stealing on out-sleeping travellers
began to crowd through his mind, and being young to the Bush, he
could not prevent that heart of his from throbbing uneasily and
painfully against his ribs.

How did they brain people, he was wondering, with a boomerang or
nullah? or was it not more common to spear them?

But, greatly to his relief, the figure immediately afterwards
revealed itself in the person of one of the men, silently placing an
armful of wood on the half-dying embers.  Then he silently glided
away again, and next minute Archie was wrapt in the elysium of
forgetfulness.

The dews lay all about, glittering in the first beams of the sun,
when he awoke, feeling somewhat cold and considerably stiff; but warm
tea and a breakfast of wondrous solidity soon put him all to rights
again.

Two nights after this the new stock was safe in the yards; and every
evening before sundown, for many a day to come, they had to be
"tailed," and brought within the strong bars of the rendezvous.

Branding was the next business.  This is no trifling matter with old
cattle.  With the calves indeed it is a bit troublesome at times, but
the grown-up ones resent the adding of insult to injury.  It is no
uncommon thing for men to be severely injured during the operation.
Nevertheless the agility displayed by the stockmen and their
excessive coolness is marvellous to behold.

Most of those cattle were branded with a "B.H.," which stood for Bob
and Harry; but some were marked with the letters "A.B.," for
Archibald Broadbent, and--I need not hide the truth--Archie was a
proud young man when he saw these marks.  He realized now fully that
he had commenced life in earnest, and was a squatter, not only in
name, but in reality.

The fencing work and improvements still went gaily on, the ground
being divided into immense paddocks, many of which our young farmers
trusted to see ere long covered with waving grain.

The new herds soon got used to the country, and settled down on it,
dividing themselves quietly into herds of their own making, that were
found browsing together mornings and evenings in the best pastures,
or gathered in mobs during the fierce heat of the middle-day.

Archie quickly enough acquired the craft of a cunning and bold
stockman, and never seemed happier than when riding neck and neck
with some runaway semi-wild bull, or riding in the midst of a mob,
selecting the beast that was wanted.  And at a job like the latter
Tell and he appeared to be only one individual betwixt the two of
them, like the fabled Centaur.  He came to grief though once, while
engaged heading a bull in as ugly a bit of country as any stockman
ever rode over.  It happened----  Next chapter, please.
