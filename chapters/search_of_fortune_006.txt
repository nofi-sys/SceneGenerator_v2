"_BOYS WILL BE BOYS._"

Bob Cooper was as good as his word, which he had pledged to Archie on
that night at Burley Old Farm, and Branson never saw him again in the
Squire's preserves.

Nor had he ever been obliged to compeer before the Squire
himself--who was now a magistrate--to account for any acts of
trespass in pursuit of game on the lands of other lairds.  But this
does not prove that Bob had given up poaching.  He was discreetly
silent about this matter whenever he met Archie.

He had grown exceedingly fond of the lad, and used to be delighted
when he called at his mother's cottage on his "Eider Duck."  There
was always a welcome waiting Archie here, and whey to drink, which,
it must be admitted, is very refreshing on a warm summer's day.

Well, Bob on these occasions used to show Archie how to make flies,
or busk hooks, and gave him a vast deal of information about outdoor
life and sport generally.

The subject of poaching was hardly ever broached; only once, when he
and Archie were talking together in the little cottage, Bob himself
volunteered the following information:

"The gentry folks, Master Archie, think me a terrible man; and they
wonder I don't go and plough, or something.  La! they little know
I've been brought up in the hills.  Sport I must hae.  I couldna live
away from nature.  But I'm never cruel.  Heigho!  I suppose I must
leave the country, and seek for sport in wilder lands, where the man
o' money doesn't trample on the poor.  Only one thing keeps me here."

He glanced out of the window as he spoke to where his old mother was
cooking dinner _al fresco_--boiling a pot as the gipsy does, hung
from a tripod.

"I know, I know," said Archie.

"How old are you now, Master Archie?"

"Going on for fourteen."

"Is that all?  Why ye're big eno' for a lad o' seventeen!"

This was true.  Archie was wondrous tall, and wondrous brown and
handsome.  His hardy upbringing and constant out-door exercise, in
summer's shine or winter's snow, fully accounted for his stature and
looks.

"I'm almost getting too big for my pony."

"Ah! no, lad; Shetlands'll carry most anything."

"Well, I must be going, Bob Cooper.  Good-bye."

"Good-bye, Master Archie.  Ah! lad, if there were more o' your kind
and your father's in the country, there would be fewer bad men
like--like me."

"I don't like to hear you saying that, Bob.  Couldn't you be a good
man if you liked?  You're big enough."

The poacher laughed.

"Yes," he replied, "I'm big enough; but, somehow, goodness don't
strike right home to me like.  It don't come natural--that's it."

"My brother Rupert says it is so easy to be good, if you read and
pray God to teach and help you."

"Ah, Master Archie, your brother is good himself, but he doesn't know
all."

"My brother Rupert bade me tell you that; but, oh, Bob, how nice he
can speak.  I can't.  I can fish and shoot, and ride 'Eider Duck;'
but I can't say things so pretty as he can.  Well, good-bye again."

"Good-bye again, and tell your brother that I can't be good all at
one jump like, but I'll begin to try mebbe.  So long."
