PREFACE.


In this story of Cape Cod during the War of 1812 the author has essayed
to give an accurate picture of some of the trials which the harassed
inhabitants endured under the guns of the British warships.

The plight of Eastham in those days was that of many other towns on the
Cape. The seafaring population of the district was utterly at the mercy
of the enemy and all trade was at a standstill in consequence of the
embargo on commerce. Deserted by the National and State governments,
the sturdy people bore their sufferings with heroic fortitude and
stubbornly resisted the invasion of their shores, now meeting the
arrogant foe in deadly combat and driving him to his boats, and again,
successfully matching their wits against his might, capitulating only
when further resistance appeared useless.

The author has had the advantage of many years’ residence in the
district and the privilege and pleasure of close acquaintance with
the descendants of some of the characters in this tale, and, as an
interested student of local history and tradition, his researches have
instilled him with intense admiration for the virile race that first
settled on this historic ground and whose indomitable perseverance and
success in the face of almost insuperable difficulties have won the
applause of the world.

“Old times have changed, old manners gone,” but in the little towns
of the Cape today the sons of this brave old stock preserve many of
the salient characteristics of their sires and are not lacking in
the spirit which made Cape Cod something more than a geographical
expression in the annals of the Nation.

“Hoppy” Mayo, Peter Walker, Squire Harding Knowles and others mentioned
in the story were sterling citizens of Eastham a century ago and
they were typical of the men who lived in those days; men of keen
intelligence and patriotism, graduates of the little red schoolhouses
where they were taught to express their thoughts in the clear English
which was the language of their Pilgrim ancestors.

In this little volume the author has followed closely the facts as
recorded by such writers as the Rev. Enoch Pratt, the Hon. Charles F.
Swift and others who have given attention to the story of Cape Cod. The
main purpose of the book is to stimulate interest in the study of the
chronicles and traditions of the Cape and the author hopes that his
efforts in this direction will merit the approbation of the public.
