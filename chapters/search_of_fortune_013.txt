III.

"_SOMETHING IN SOAP._"

It was a still, sultry night in November.  Archie's balcony window
was wide open, and if there had been a breath of air anywhere he
would have had the benefit of it.  That was one advantage of having a
room high up above the town, and there were several others.  For
instance, it was quieter, more retired, and his companions did not
often take him by storm, because they objected to climb so many
stairs.  Dingy, small, and dismal some might have called it, but
Archie always felt at home up in his semi-attic.  It even reminded
him of his room in the dear old tower at Burley.  Then his morsel of
balcony, why that was worth all the money he paid for the room
itself; and as for the view from this charming, though
non-aristocratic elevation, it was simply unsurpassed,
unsurpassable--looking far away over a rich and fertile country to
the grand old hills beyond--a landscape that, like the sea, was still
the same, but ever changing; sometimes smiling and green, sometimes
bathed in tints of purple and blue, sometimes grey as a sky o'ercast
with rain clouds.  Yes, he loved it, and he would take a chair out
here on a moonlight evening and sit and think and dream.

But on this particular night sleep, usually so kind to the young man,
absolutely refused to visit his pillow.  He tried to woo the goddess
on his right side, on his left, on his back; it was all in vain.
Finally, he sat bolt upright in his little truckle bed in silent
defiance.

"I don't care," he said aloud, "whether I sleep or not.  What does it
matter?  I've nothing to do to-morrow.  Heigho!"

Nothing to do to-morrow!  How sad!  And he so young too.  Were all
his dreams of future fortune to fade and pass away like this--nothing
to do?  Why he envied the very boys who drove the mill wagons that
went lazily rolling past his place every day.  They seemed happy, and
so contented; while he--why his very life--had come to be all one
continued fever.

"Nothing to do yet, sir?"  It was the ordinary salutation of his
hard-working mite of a landlady when he came home to his meal in the
afternoon.  "I knows by the weary way ye walks upstairs, sir, you
aren't successful yet, sir."

"Nothink to do yet, sir?"  They were the usual words that the slavey
used when she dragged upstairs of an evening with his tea-things.

"Nothink to do," she would say, as she deposited the tray on the
table, and sank _sans ceremonie_ into the easy-chair.  "Nothink to
do.  What a 'appy life to lead!  Now 'ere's me a draggin' up and down
stairs, and a carryin' of coals and a sweepin', and a dustin' and a
hanswering of the door, till, what wi' the 'eat and the dust and the
fleas, my poor little life's well-nigh worrited out o' me.  Heigho!
hif I was honly back again in merrie England, catch me ever goin' to
any Australia any more.  But you looks a borned gent, sir.  Nothink
to do!  My eye and Betty Martin, ye oughter to be 'appy, if you
ain't."

Archie got up to-night, enrobed himself in his dressing-gown, and
went and sat on his balcony.  This soothed him.  The stars were very
bright, and seemed very near.  He did not care for other
companionship than these and his own all-too-busy thoughts.  There
was hardly a sound to be heard, except now and then the hum of a
distant railway train increasing to a harsh roar as it crossed the
bridge, then becoming subdued again and muffled as it entered woods,
or went rolling over a soft and open country.

Nothing to do!  But he must and would do something.  Why should he
starve in a city of plenty?  He had arms and hands, if he hadn't a
head.  Indeed, he had begun of late to believe that his head, which
he used to think so much of, was the least important part of his
body.  He caught himself feeling his forearm and his biceps.  Why
this latter had got smaller and beautifully less of late.  He had to
shut his fist hard to make it perceptible to touch.  This was worse
and worse, he thought.  He would not be able to lift a fifty-six if
he wanted to before long, or have strength enough left to wield a
stable broom if he should be obliged to go as gardener to Winslow.

"What next, I wonder?" he said to himself.  "First I lose my brains,
if ever I had any, and now I have lost my biceps; the worst loss
last."

He lit his candle, and took up the newspaper.  "I'll pocket my pride,
and take a porter's situation," he murmured.  "Let us see now.
Hullo! what is this?  'APPRENTICE WANTED--the drug trade--splendid
opening to a pushing youngster.'  Well, I am a pushing youngster.
'Premium required.'  I don't care, I have a bit of money left, and
I'll pay it like a man if there is enough.  Why the drug trade is
grand.  Sydney drug-stores beat Glasgow's all to pieces.  Druggists
and drysalters have their carriages and mansions, their town and
country houses.  Hurrah!  I'll be something yet!"

He blew out the candle, and jumped into bed.  The gentle goddess
required no further wooing.  She took him in her lap, and he went off
at once like a baby.

Rap--rap--rap--rap!

"Hullo!  Yes; coming, Sarah; coming."

It was broad daylight; and when he admitted Sarah at last, with the
breakfast-tray, she told him she had been up and down fifty times,
trying to make him hear.  Sarah was given to a little exaggeration at
times.

"It was all very well for a gent like he," she said, "but there was
her a-slavin' and a-toilin', and all the rest of it."

"Well, well, my dear," he cut in, "I'm awfully sorry, I assure you."

Sarah stopped right in the centre of the room, still holding the
tray, and looked at him.

"What!" she cried.  "Ye ain't a-going to marry me then, young man!
What are ye my-dearing me for?"

"No, Sarah," replied Archie, laughing; "I'm not going to marry you;
but I've hopes of a good situation, and----"

"Is that all?"  Sarah dumped down the tray, and tripped away singing.

Archie's interview with the advertiser was of a most satisfactory
character.  He did not like the street, it was too new and out of the
way; but then it would be a beginning.

He did not like his would-be employer, but he dared say he would
improve on acquaintance.  There was plenty in the shop, though the
place was dingy and dirty, and the windows small.  The spiders
evidently had fine times of it here, and did not object to the smell
of drugs.  He was received by Mr. Glorie himself in a little back
sanctum off the little back shop.

The premium for apprenticing Archie was rather more than the young
man could give; but this being explained to the proprietor of these
beautiful premises, and owner of all the spiders, he graciously
condescended to take half.  Archie's salary--a wretched pittance--was
to commence at once after articles were signed; and Mr. Glorie
promised to give him a perfect insight into the drug business, and
make a man of him, and "something else besides," he added, nodding to
Archie in a mysterious manner.

The possessor of the strange name was a queer-looking man; there did
not appear much glory about him.  He was very tall, very lanky, and
thin, his shoulders sloping downwards like a well-pointed pencil,
while his face was solemn and elongated, like your own, reader, if
you look at it in a spoon held lengthways.

The articles were signed, and Archie walked home on feathers
apparently.  He went upstairs singing.  His landlady ran to the door.

"Work at last?"

Archie nodded and smiled.

When Sarah came in with the dinner things she danced across the room,
bobbing her queer, old-fashioned face and crying--

  "Lawk-a-daisy, diddle-um-doo,
  Missus says you've got work to do!"


"Yes, Sarah, at long last, and I'm so happy."

"'Appy, indeed!" sang Sarah.  "Why, ye won't be the gent no longer!"

Archie certainly had got work to do.  For a time his employer kept
him in the shop.  There was only one other lad, and he went home with
the physic, and what with studying hard to make himself _au fait_ in
prescribing and selling seidlitz powders and gum drops, Archie was
pretty busy.

So months flew by.  Then his long-faced employer took him into the
back premises, and proceeded to initiate him into the mysteries of
the something else that was to make a man of him.

"There's a fortune in it," said Mr. Glorie, pointing to a bubbling
grease-pot.  "Yes, young sir, a vast fortune."

"What is the speciality?" Archie ventured to enquire.

"The speciality, young sir?" replied Mr. Glorie, his face relaxing
into something as near a smile as it would permit of.  "The
speciality, sir, is SOAP.  A transparent soap.  A soap, young sir,
that is destined to revolutionise the world of commerce, and bring my
star to the ascendant after struggling for two long decades with the
dark clouds of adversity."

So this was the mystery.  Archie was henceforward, so it appeared, to
live in an atmosphere of scented soap; his hope must centre in
bubbles.  He was to assist this Mr. Glorie's star to rise to the
zenith, while his own fortune might sink to nadir.  And he had paid
his premium.  It was swallowed up and simmering in that ugly old
grease-pot, and except for the miserable salary he received from Mr.
Glorie he might starve.

Poor Archie!  He certainly did not share his employer's enthusiasm,
and on this particular evening he did not walk home on feathers, and
when he sat down to supper his face must have appeared to Sarah quite
as long and lugubrious as Mr. Glorie's; for she raised her hands and
said:

"Lawk-a-doodle, sir!  What's the matter?  Have ye killed anybody?"

"Not yet," answered Archie; "but I almost feel I could."

He stuck to his work, however, like a man; but that work became more
and more allied to soap, and the front shop hardly knew him any more.

He had informed the fellows at the club-room that he was employed at
last; that he was apprenticed to the drug trade.  But the soap
somehow leaked out, and more than once, when he was introduced to
some new-comer, he was styled--

"Mr. Broadbent," and "something in soap."

This used to make him bite his lips in anger.

He would not have cared half so much had he not joined this very
club, with a little flourish of trumpets, as young Broadbent, son of
Squire Broadbent, of Burley Old Castle, England.

And now he was "something in soap."

He wrote home to his sister in the bitterness of his soul, telling
her that all his visions of greatness had ended in bubbles of rainbow
hue, and that he was "something in soap."  He felt sorry for having
done so as soon as the letter was posted.

He met old Winslow one day in the street, and this gentleman grasped
Archie's small aristocratic hand in his great brown bear's paw, and
congratulated him on having got on his feet at last.

"Yes," said Archie with a sneer and a laugh, "I'm 'something in
soap.'"

"And soap's a good thing I can tell you.  Soap's not to be despised.
There's a fortune in soap.  I had an uncle in soap.  Stick to it, my
lad, and it'll stick to you."

But when a new apprentice came to the shop one day, and was installed
in the front-door drug department, while he himself was relegated to
the slums at the back, his cup of misery seemed full, and he
proceeded forthwith to tell this Mr. Glorie what he thought of him.
Mr. Glorie's face got longer and longer and longer, and he finally
brought his clenched fist down with such a bang on the counter, that
every bottle and glass in the place rang like bells.

"I'll have the law on you," he shouted.

"I don't care; I've done with you.  I'm sick of you and your soap."

He really did not mean to do it; but just at that moment his foot
kicked against a huge earthenware jar full of oil, and shivered it in
pieces.

"You've broke your indenture!  You--you----"

"I've broken your jar, anyhow," cried Archie.

He picked up his hat, and rushing out, ran recklessly off to his club.

He was "something in soap" no more.

He was beggared, but he was free, unless indeed Mr. Glorie should put
him in gaol.
