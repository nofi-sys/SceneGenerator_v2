"_BOYS WILL BE BOYS._"

Bob Cooper was as good as his word, which he had pledged to Archie on
that night at Burley Old Farm, and Branson never saw him again in the
Squire's preserves.

Nor had he ever been obliged to compeer before the Squire
himself--who was now a magistrate--to account for any acts of
trespass in pursuit of game on the lands of other lairds.  But this
does not prove that Bob had given up poaching.  He was discreetly
silent about this matter whenever he met Archie.

He had grown exceedingly fond of the lad, and used to be delighted
when he called at his mother's cottage on his "Eider Duck."  There
was always a welcome waiting Archie here, and whey to drink, which,
it must be admitted, is very refreshing on a warm summer's day.

Well, Bob on these occasions used to show Archie how to make flies,
or busk hooks, and gave him a vast deal of information about outdoor
life and sport generally.

The subject of poaching was hardly ever broached; only once, when he
and Archie were talking together in the little cottage, Bob himself
volunteered the following information:

"The gentry folks, Master Archie, think me a terrible man; and they
wonder I don't go and plough, or something.  La! they little know
I've been brought up in the hills.  Sport I must hae.  I couldna live
away from nature.  But I'm never cruel.  Heigho!  I suppose I must
leave the country, and seek for sport in wilder lands, where the man
o' money doesn't trample on the poor.  Only one thing keeps me here."

He glanced out of the window as he spoke to where his old mother was
cooking dinner _al fresco_--boiling a pot as the gipsy does, hung
from a tripod.

"I know, I know," said Archie.

"How old are you now, Master Archie?"

"Going on for fourteen."

"Is that all?  Why ye're big eno' for a lad o' seventeen!"

This was true.  Archie was wondrous tall, and wondrous brown and
handsome.  His hardy upbringing and constant out-door exercise, in
summer's shine or winter's snow, fully accounted for his stature and
looks.

"I'm almost getting too big for my pony."

"Ah! no, lad; Shetlands'll carry most anything."

"Well, I must be going, Bob Cooper.  Good-bye."

"Good-bye, Master Archie.  Ah! lad, if there were more o' your kind
and your father's in the country, there would be fewer bad men
like--like me."

"I don't like to hear you saying that, Bob.  Couldn't you be a good
man if you liked?  You're big enough."

The poacher laughed.

"Yes," he replied, "I'm big enough; but, somehow, goodness don't
strike right home to me like.  It don't come natural--that's it."

"My brother Rupert says it is so easy to be good, if you read and
pray God to teach and help you."

"Ah, Master Archie, your brother is good himself, but he doesn't know
all."

"My brother Rupert bade me tell you that; but, oh, Bob, how nice he
can speak.  I can't.  I can fish and shoot, and ride 'Eider Duck;'
but I can't say things so pretty as he can.  Well, good-bye again."

"Good-bye again, and tell your brother that I can't be good all at
one jump like, but I'll begin to try mebbe.  So long."

Archie Broadbent might have been said to have two kinds of home
education; one was thoroughly scholastic, the other very practical
indeed.  The Squire was one in a hundred perhaps.  He was devoted to
his farm, and busied himself in the field, manually as well as
orally.  I mean to say that he was of such an active disposition
that, while superintending and giving advice and orders, he put his
hand to the wheel himself.  So did Mr. Walton, and whether it was
harvest-time or haymaking, you would have found Squire Broadbent, the
tutor, and Archie hard at it, and even little Elsie doing a little.

I would not like to say that the Squire was a radical, but he
certainly was no believer in the benefits of too much class
distinction.  He thought Burns was right when he said--

  "A man's a man for a' that."


Was he any the less liked or less respected by his servants, because
he and his boy tossed hay in the same field with them?  I do not
think so, and I know that the work always went more merrily on when
they were there; and that laughing and even singing could be heard
all day long.  Moreover, there was less beer drank, and more tea.
The Squire supplied both liberally, and any man might have which he
chose.  Consequently there was less, far less, tired-headedness and
languor in the evening.  Why, it was nothing uncommon for the lads
and lasses of Burley Old Farm to meet together on the lawn, after a
hard day's toil, and dance for hours to the merry notes of Branson's
fiddle.

We have heard of model farms; this Squire's was one; but the
servants, wonderful to say, were contented.  There was never such a
thing as grumbling heard from one year's end to the other.

Christmas too was always kept in the good, grand old style.  Even a
yule log, drawn from the wood, was considered a property of the
performances; and as for good cheer, why there was "lashins" of it,
as an Irishman would say, and fun "galore," to borrow a word from
beyond the Border.

Mr. Walton was a scholarly person, though you might not have thought
so, had you seen him mowing turnips with his coat off.  He, however,
taught nothing to Archie or Rupert that might not have some practical
bearing on his after life.  Such studies as mathematics and algebra
were dull, in a manner of speaking; Latin was taught because no one
can understand English without it; French and German
conversationally; geography not by rote, but thoroughly; and
everything else was either very practical and useful, or very
pleasant.

Music Archie loved, but did not care to play; his father did not
force him; but poor Rupert played the zither.  He loved it, and took
to it naturally.

Rupert got stronger as he grew older, and when Archie was fourteen
and he thirteen, the physician gave good hopes; and he was even able
to walk by himself a little.  But to some extent he would be "Poor
Rupert" as long as he lived.

He read and thought far more than Archie, and--let me whisper it--he
prayed more fervently.

"Oh, Roup," Archie would say, "I should like to be as good as you!
Somehow, I don't feel to need to pray so much, and to have the Lord
Jesus so close to me."

It was a strange conceit this, but Rupert's answer was a good one.

"Yes, Archie, I need comfort more; but mind you, brother, the day may
come when you'll want comfort of this kind too."

* * * * * *

Old Kate really was a queer old witch of a creature, superstitious to
a degree.  Here is an example: One day she came rushing--without
taking time to knock even--into the breakfast parlour.

"Oh, Mistress Broadbent, what a ghast I've gotten!"

"Dear me!" said the Squire's wife; "sit down and tell us.  What is
it, poor Kate?"

"Oh!  Oh!" she sighed.  "Nae wonder my puir legs ached.  Oh! sirs!
sirs!

"Ye ken my little pantry?  Well, there's been a board doon on the
fleer for ages o' man, and to-day it was taken out to be scrubbit,
and what think ye was reveeled?"

"I couldn't guess."

"Words, 'oman; words, printed and painted on the timmer--'_Sacred to
the Memory of Dinah Brown, Aged 99._'  A tombstone, 'oman--a wooden
gravestone, and me standin' on't a' these years."

Here the Squire was forced to burst out into a hearty laugh, for
which his wife reprimanded him, by a look.

There was no mistake about the "wooden tombstone," but that this was
the cause of old Kate's rheumatism one might take the liberty to
doubt.

Kate was a staunch believer in ghosts, goblins, fairies, kelpies,
brownies, spunkies, and all the rest of the supernatural family; and
I have something to relate in connection with this, though it is not
altogether to the credit of my hero, Archie.

Old Kate and young Peter were frequent visitors to the room in the
tower, for the tea Archie made, and the fires he kept on, were both
most excellent in their way.

"Boys will be boys," and Archie was a little inclined to practical
joking.  It made him laugh, so he said, and laughing made one fat.

It happened that, one dark winter's evening, old Kate was invited up
into the tower, and Branson with Peter came also.  Archie volunteered
a song, and Branson played many a fine old air on his fiddle, so that
the first part of the evening passed away pleasantly and even merrily
enough.  Old Kate drank cup after cup of tea as she sat in that weird
old chair, and, by-and-by, Archie, the naughty boy that he was, led
the conversation round to ghosts.  The ancient dame was in her
element now; she launched forth into story after story, and each was
more hair-stirring than its predecessor.

Elsie and Archie occupied their favourite place on a bear's skin in
front of the low fire; and while Kate still droned on, and Branson
listened with eyes and mouth wide open, the boy might have been
noticed to stoop down, and whisper something in his sister's ear.

Almost immediately after a rattling of chains could be heard in one
of the turrets.  Both Kate and Branson started, and the former could
not be prevailed upon to resume her story till Archie lit a candle
and walked all round the room, drawing back the turret curtains to
show no one was there.

Once again old Kate began, and once again chains were heard to
rattle, and a still more awesome sound followed--a long, low,
deep-bass groan, while at the same time, strange to say, the candle
in Archie's hand burnt blue.  To add to the fearsomeness of the
situation, while the chain continued to rattle, and the groaning now
and then, there was a very appreciable odour of sulphur in the
apartment.  This was the climax.  Old Kate screamed, and the big
keeper, Branson, fell on his knees in terror.  Even Elsie, though she
had an inkling of what was to happen, began to feel afraid.

"There now, granny," cried Archie, having carried the joke far
enough, "here is the groaning ghost."  As he spoke he produced a pair
of kitchen bellows, with a musical reed in the pipe, which he
proceeded to sound in old Kate's very face, looking a very
mischievous imp while he did so.

"Oh," said old Kate, "what a scare the laddie has given me.  But the
chain?"

Archie pulled a string, and the chain rattled again.

"And the candle?  That was na canny."

"A dust of sulphur in the wick, granny."

Big Branson looked ashamed of himself, and old Kate herself began to
smile once more.

"But how could ye hae the heart to scare an old wife sae, Master
Archie?"

"Oh, granny, we got up the fun just to show you there were no such
things as ghosts.  Rupert says--and he should know, because he's
always reading--that ghosts are always rats or something."

"Ye maunna frichten me again, laddie.  Will ye promise?"

"Yes, granny, there's my hand on it.  Now sit down and have another
cup of tea, and Elsie will play and sing."

Elsie could sing now, and sweet young voice she had, that seemed to
carry you to happier lands.  Branson always said it made him feel a
boy again, wandering through the woods in summer, or chasing the
butterflies over flowery beds.

And so, albeit Archie had carried his practical joke out to his own
satisfaction, if not to that of every one else, this evening, like
many others that had come before it, and came after it, passed away
pleasantly enough.

* * * * * *

It was in the spring of the same year, and during the Easter
holidays, that a little London boy came down to reside with his aunt,
who lived in one of Archie's father's cottages.

Young Harry Brown had been sent to the country for the express
purpose of enjoying himself, and set about this business forthwith.
He made up to Archie; in fact, he took so many liberties, and talked
to him so glibly, and with so little respect, that, although Archie
had imbued much of his father's principles as regards liberalism, he
did not half like it.

Perhaps, after all, it was only the boy's manner, for he had never
been to the country at all before, and looked upon every one--Archie
included--who did not know London, as jolly green.  But Archie did
not appreciate it, and, like the traditional worm, he turned, and
once again his love for practical joking got the better of his
common-sense.

"Teach us somefink," said Harry one day, turning his white face up.
He was older, perhaps, than Archie, but decidedly smaller.  "Teach us
somefink, and when you comes to Vitechapel to wisit me, I'll teach
you summut.  My eye, won't yer stare!"

The idea of this white-chafted, unwholesome-looking cad, expecting
that _he_, Squire Broadbent's son, would visit him in Whitechapel!
But Archie managed to swallow his wrath and pocket his pride for the
time being.

"What shall I teach you, eh?  I suppose you know that potatoes don't
grow on trees, nor geese upon gooseberry-bushes?"

"Yes; I know that taters is dug out of the hearth.  I'm pretty fly
for a young un."

"Can you ride?"

"No."

"Well, meet me here to-morrow at the same time, and I'll bring my
'Duck.'"

"Look 'ere, Johnnie Raw, ye said '_ride_,' not '_swim_.' A duck
teaches swimmin', not ridin'.  None o' yer larks now!"

Next day Archie swept down upon the Cockney in fine form, meaning to
impress him.

The Cockney was not much impressed; I fear he was not very
impressionable.

"My heye, Johnnie Raw," he roared, "vere did yer steal the moke?"

"Look you here, young Whitechapel, you'll have to guard that tongue
of yours a little, else communications will be cut.  Do you see?"

"It _is_ a donkey, ain't it, Johnnie?"

"Come on to the field and have a ride."

Five minutes afterwards the young Cockney on the "Eider Duck's" back
was tearing along the field at railway speed.  John Gilpin's ride was
nothing to it, nor Tam O'Shanter's on his grey mare, Meg!  Both these
worthies had stuck to the saddle, but this horseman rode upon the
neck of the steed.  Scallowa stopped short at the gate, but the boy
flew over.

Archie found his friend rubbing himself, and looking very serious,
and he felt happier now.

"Call that 'ere donkey a heider duck?  H'm?  I allers thought heider
ducks was soft!

"One to you, Johnnie.  I don't want to ride hany more."

"What else shall I teach you?"

"Hey?"

"Come, I'll show you over the farm."

"Honour bright?  No larks!"

"Yes; no larks!"

"Say honour."

"Honour."

Young Whitechapel had not very much faith in his guide, however; but
he saw more country wonders that day than ever he could have dreamt
of; while his strange remarks kept Archie continually laughing.

Next day the two boys went bird-nesting, and really Archie was very
mischievous.  He showed him a hoody-crow's nest, which he represented
as a green plover's or lapwing's; and a blackbird's nest in a
furze-bush, which he told Harry was a magpie's; and so on, and so
forth, till at last he got tired of the cheeky Cockney, and sent him
off on a mile walk to a cairn of stones, on which he told him crows
sometimes sat and "might have a nest."

Then Archie threw himself on the moss, took out a book, and began to
read.  He was just beginning to repent of his conduct to Harry Brown,
and meant to go up to him like a man when he returned, and crave his
forgiveness.

But somehow, when Harry came back he had so long a face, that wicked
Archie burst out laughing, and forgot all about his good resolve.

"What shall I teach you next?" said Archie.

"Draw it mild, Johnnie; it's 'Arry's turn.  It's the boy's turn to
teach you summut.  Shall we 'ave it hout now wi' the raw uns?
Bunches o' fives I means.  Hey?"

"I really don't understand you."

"Ha! ha! ha!  I knowed yer was a green 'un, Johnnie.  Can yer fight?
Hey?  'Cause I'm spoilin' for a row."

And Harry Brown threw off his jacket, and began to dance about in
terribly knowing attitudes.

"You had better put on your clothes again," said Archie.  "Fight
_you_?  Why I could fling you over the fishpond."

"Ah!  I dessay; but flingin' ain't fightin', Johnnie.  Come, there's
no getting hout of it.  It ain't the first young haristocrat I've
frightened; an' now you're afraid."

That was enough for Archie.  And the next moment the lads were at it.

But Archie had met his match; he went down a dozen times.  He
remained down the last time.

"It is wonderful," he said.  "I quite admire you.  But I've had
enough; I'm beaten."

"Spoken like a plucked 'un.  Haven't swallowed yer teeth, hey?"

"No; but I'll have a horrid black-eye."

"Raw beef, my boy; raw beef."

"Well; I confess I've caught a tartar."

"An' I caught a crab yesterday.  Wot about your eider duck?  My heye!
Johnnie, I ain't been able to sit down conweniently since.  I say,
Johnnie?"

"Well."

"Friends, hey?"

"All right."

Then the two shook hands, and young Whitechapel said if Archie would
buy two pairs of gloves he would show him how it was done.  So Archie
did, and became an apt pupil in the noble art of self-defence; which
may be used at times, but never abused.

However, Archie Broadbent never forgot that lesson in the wood.
