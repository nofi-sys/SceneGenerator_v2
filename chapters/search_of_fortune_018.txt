I.

"_SPOKEN LIKE HIS FATHER'S SON._"

  "Cheer, boys, cheer, no more of idle sorrow,
    Courage, true hearts shall bear us on our way;
  Hope flies before, and points the bright to-morrow,
    Let us forget the dangers of to-day."


That dear old song!  How many a time and oft it has helped to raise
the drooping spirits of emigrants sailing away from these loved
islands, never again to return!

The melody itself too is such a manly one.  Inez dear, bring my
fiddle.  Not a bit of bravado in that ringing air, bold and all
though it is.  Yet every line tells of British ardour and
determination--ardour that no thoughts of home or love can cool,
determination that no danger can daunt.

"Cheer, boys, cheer."  The last rays of the setting sun were lighting
up the Cornish cliffs, on which so few in that good ship would ever
again set eyes, when those around the forecastle-head took up the
song.

"Cheer, boys, cheer."  Listen!  Those on the quarterdeck join in the
chorus, sinking in song all difference of class and rank.  And they
join, too, in that rattling "Three times three" that bids farewell to
England.

Then the crimson clouds high up in the west change to purple and
brown, the sea grows grey, and the distant shore becomes slaty blue.
Soon the stars peep out, and the passengers cease to tramp about, and
find their way below to the cosily-lighted saloon.

Archie is sitting on a sofa quite apart from all the others.  The
song is still ringing in his head, and, if the whole truth must be
told, he feels just a trifle down-hearted.  He cannot quite account
for this, though he tries to, and his thoughts are upon the whole
somewhat rambling.  They would no doubt be quite connected if it were
not for the distracting novelty of all his present surroundings,
which are as utterly different from anything he has hitherto become
acquainted with as if he had suddenly been transported to another
planet.

No, he cannot account for being dull.  Perhaps the motion of the ship
has something to do with it, though this is not a very romantic way
of putting it.  Archie has plenty of moral courage; and as the ship
encountered head winds, and made a long and most difficult passage
down through the Irish Sea, he braced himself to get over his morsel
of _mal de mer_, and has succeeded.

He is quite cross with himself for permitting his mind to be tinged
with melancholy.  That song ought to have set him up.

"Why should we weep to sail in search of fortune?"

Oh, Archie is not weeping; catch him doing anything so girlish and
peevish!  He would not cry in his cabin where he could do so without
being seen, and it is not likely he would permit moisture to appear
in his eyes in the saloon here.  Yet his home never did seem to him
so delightful, so cosy, so happy, as the thoughts of it do now.  Why
had he not loved it even more than he did when it was yet all around
him?  The dear little green parlour, his gentle lady mother that used
to knit so quietly by the fire in the winter's evenings, listening
with pleasure to his father's daring schemes and hopeful plans.  His
bonnie sister, Elsie, so proud of him--Archie; Rupert, with his pale,
classical face and gentle smile; matter-of-fact Walton; jolly old
Uncle Ramsay.  They all rose up before his mind's eye as they had
been; nay but as they might be even at that very moment.  And the
room in the tower, the evenings spent there in summer when daylight
was fading over the hills and woods, and the rooks flying wearily
home to their nests in the swaying elm trees; or in winter when the
fire burned brightly on the hearth, and weird old Kate sat in her
high-hacked chair, telling her strange old-world stories, with
Branson, wide-eyed, fiddle in hand, on a seat near her, and
Bounder--poor Bounder--on the bear's skin.  Then the big kitchen, or
servants' hall--the servants that all loved "master Archie" so
dearly, and laughed and enjoyed every prank he used to play.

Dear old Burley! should he ever see it again?  A week has not passed
since he left it, and yet it seems and feels a lifetime.

He was young a week ago; now he is old, very old--nearly a man.
Nearly?  Well, nearly in years; in thoughts, and feelings, and
circumstances even--quite a man.  But then he should not feel
down-hearted for this simple reason; he had left home under such
bright auspices.  Many boys run away to sea.  The difference between
their lot and his is indeed a wide one.  Yes, that must be very sad.
No home-life to look back upon, no friends to think of or love, no
pleasant present, no hopeful future.

Then Archie, instead of letting his thoughts dwell any longer on the
past, began at once to bridge over for himself the long period of
time that must elapse ere he should return to Burley Old Farm.  Of
course there would be changes.  He dared say Walton would be away;
but Elsie and Rupert would still be there, and his father and mother,
looking perhaps a little older, but still as happy.  And the burned
farm-steading would be restored, or if it were not, it soon should be
after he came back; for he would be rich, rolling in wealth in fact,
if half the stories he had heard of Australia were true, even
allowing that _all_ the streets were not paved with gold, and _all_
the houses not roofed with sparkling silver.

So engrossed was he with these pleasant thoughts, that he had not
observed the advent of a passenger who had entered the saloon, and
sat quietly down on a camp-stool near him.  A man of about forty,
dressed in a rough pilot suit of clothes, with a rosy weather-beaten
but pleasant face, and a few grey hairs in his short black beard.

He was looking at Archie intently when their eyes met, and the boy
felt somewhat abashed.  The passenger, however, did not remove his
glance instantly; he spoke instead.

"You've never been to sea before, have you?"

"No, sir; never been off the land till a week ago."

"Going to seek your fortune?"

"Yes; I'm going to make my fortune."

"Bravo!  I hope you will."

"What's to hinder me?"

"Nothing; oh, nothing much!  Everybody doesn't though.  But you seem
to have a bit of go in you."

"Are you going to make yours?" said Archie.

The stranger laughed.

"No," he replied.  "Unluckily, perhaps, mine was made for me.  I've
been out before too, and I'm going again to see things."

"You're going in quest of adventure?"

"I suppose that is really it.  That is how the story books put it,
anyhow.  But I don't expect to meet with adventures like Sinbad the
Sailor, you know; and I don't think I would like to have a little old
man of the sea with his little old legs round my neck."

"Australia is a very wonderful place, isn't it?"

"Yes; wonderfully wonderful.  Everything is upside-down there, you
know.  To begin with, the people walk with their heads downwards.
Some of the trees are as tall as the moon, and at certain seasons of
the year the bark comes tumbling off them like rolls of shoeleather.
Others are shaped like bottles, others again have heads of waving
grass, and others have ferns for tops.  There are trees, too, that
drop all their leaves to give the flowers a chance; and these are so
brilliantly red, and so numerous, that the forest where they grow
looks all on fire.  Well, many of the animals walk or jump on two
legs, instead of running on four.  Does that interest you?"

"Yes.  Tell me something more about birds."

"Well, ducks are everywhere in Australia, and many kinds are as big
as geese.  They seem to thrive.  And ages ago, it is said by the
natives, the moles in Australia got tired of living in the dark, and
held a meeting above-ground, and determined to live a different mode
of life.  So they grew longer claws, and short, broad, flat tails,
and bills like ducks, and took to the water, and have been happy ever
since.

"Well, there are black swans in abundance; and though it is two or
three years since I was out last, I cannot forget a beautiful bird,
something betwixt a pheasant and peacock, and the cock's tail is his
especial delight.  It is something really to be proud of, and at a
distance looks like a beautiful lyre, strings and all.  The cockatoos
swarm around the trees, and scream and laugh at the lyre-bird giving
himself airs, but I daresay this is all envy.  The hen bird is not a
beauty, but her chief delight is to watch the antics and attitudes of
her lord and master as he struts about making love and fun to her
time about, at one moment singing a kind of low, sweet song, at
another mocking every sound that is heard in the forest, every noise
made by man or bird or beast.  No wonder the female lyre-bird thinks
her lord the cleverest and most beautiful creature in the world!

"Then there is a daft-looking kingfisher, all head and bill, and
wondering eyes, who laughs like a jackass, and makes you laugh to
hear him laugh.  So loud does he laugh at times that his voice drowns
every other sound in the forest.

"There is a bird eight feet high, partly cassowary partly ostrich,
that when attacked kicks like a horse or more like a cow, because it
kicks sideways.  But if I were to sit here till our good ship reached
the Cape, I could not tell you about half the curious, beautiful, and
ridiculous creatures and things you will find in Australia if you
move much about.  I do think that that country beats all creation for
the gorgeousness of its wild birds and wild flowers; and if things do
seem a bit higgledy-piggledy at first, you soon settle down to it,
and soon tire wondering at anything.

"But," continued the stranger, "with all their peculiarities, the
birds and beasts are satisfied with their get-up, and pleased with
their surroundings, although all day long in the forests the
cockatoos, and parrots, and piping crows, and lyre-birds do little
else but joke and chaff one another because they all look so comical.

"Yes, lad, Australia you will find is a country of contrarieties, and
the only wonder to me is that the rivers don't all run up-hill
instead of running down; and mind, they are sometimes broader at
their sources than they are at their ends."

"There is plenty of gold there?" asked Archie.

"Oh, yes, any amount; but----"

"But what, sir?"

"The real difficulty--in fact, the only difficulty--is the finding of
it."

"But that, I suppose, can be got over."

"Come along with me up on deck, and we'll talk matters over.  It is
hot and stuffy down here; besides, they are going to lay the cloth."

Arrived at the quarter-deck, the stranger took hold of Archie's arm,
as if he had known him all his life.

"Now," he said, "my name is Vesey, generally called Captain Vesey,
because I never did anything that I know of to merit the title.  I've
been in an army or two in different parts of the globe as a free
lance, you know."

"How nice!"

"Oh, delightful!" said Captain Vesey, though from the tone of his
voice Archie was doubtful as to his meaning.  "Well," he added, "I
own a yacht, now waiting for me, I believe, at the Cape of Good Hope,
if she isn't sunk, or burned, or something.  And your tally?"

"My what, sir?"

"Your tally, your name, and the rest of it?"

"Archie Broadbent, son of Squire Broadbent, of Burley Old Farm,
Northumberland."

"What! you a son of Charlie Broadbent?  Yankee Charlie, as we used to
call him at the club.  Well, well, well, wonders will never cease;
and it only shows how small the world is, after all."

"And you used to know my father, sir?"

"My dear boy, I promised myself the pleasure of calling on him at
Burley.  I've only been home for two months, however; and I
heard--well, boy, I needn't mince matters--I heard your father had
been unfortunate, and had left his place, and gone nobody could tell
me whither."

"No," said Archie, laughing, "it isn't quite so bad as all that; and
it is bound to come right in the end."

"You are talking very hopefully, lad.  I could trace a resemblance in
your face to someone I knew the very moment I sat down.  And there is
something like the same cheerful ring in your voice there used to be
in his.  You really are a chip of the old block."

"So they say."  And Archie laughed again, pleased by this time.

"But, you know, lad, you are very young to be going away to seek your
fortune."

"I'll get over that, sir."

"I hope so.  Of course, you won't go pottering after gold!"

"I don't know.  If I thought I would find lots, I would go like a
shot."

"Well, take my advice, and don't.  There, I do not want to discourage
you; but you better turn your mind to farming--to squatting."

"That wouldn't be very genteel, would it?"

"Genteel!  Why, lad, if you're going to go in for genteelity, you'd
best have stayed at home."

"Well, but I have an excellent education.  I can write like
copper-plate.  I am a fair hand at figures, and well up in Latin and
Greek; and----"

"Ha! ha! ha!"  Captain Vesey laughed aloud.  "Latin and Greek, eh?
You must keep that to yourself, boy."

"And," continued Archie boldly, "I have a whole lot of capital
introductions.  I'm sure to get into a good office in Sydney; and in
a few years----"

Archie stopped short, because by the light that streamed from the
skylight he could see that Captain Vesey was looking at him
half-wonderingly, but evidently amused.

"Go on," said the captain.

"Not a word more," said Archie doggedly.

"Finish your sentence, lad."

"I shan't.  There!"

"Well, I'll do it for you.  You'll get into a delightful office, with
mahogany writing-desks and stained glass windows, Turkey carpet and
an easy-chair.  Your employer will take you out in his buggy every
Sunday to dine with him; and after a few years, as you say, he'll
make you a co-partner; and you'll end by marrying his daughter, and
live happy ever after."

"You're laughing at me, sir.  I'll go down below."

"Yes, I'm laughing at you, because you're only a greenhorn; and it is
as well that I should squeeze a little of the lime-juice out of you
as anyone else.  No, don't go below.  Mind, I was your father's
friend."

"Yes," pouted poor Archie; "but you don't appear to be mine.  You are
throwing cold water over my hopes; you are smashing my idols."

"A very pretty speech, Archie Broadbent.  But mind you this--a hut on
solid ground is better far than a castle in the air.  And it is
better that I should storm and capsize your cloud-castle, than that
an absolute stranger did so."

"Well, I suppose you are right.  Forgive me for being cross."

"Spoken like his father's son," said Captain Vesey, grasping and
shaking the hand that Archie extended to him.  "Now we know each
other.  Ding! ding! ding! there goes the dinner-bell.  Sit next to
me."
