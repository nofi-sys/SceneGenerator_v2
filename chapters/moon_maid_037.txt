Two years later and we had driven the Kalkars into the sea, the remnants
of them flying westward in great canoes which they had built and
launched upon a beauteous bay a hundred miles or more south of The
Capital.

The Rain Cloud said that if they were not overcome by storms and waves
they might sail on and on around the world and come again to the eastern
shores of America, but the rest of us knew that they would sail to the
edge of the Earth and tumble off and that would be the end of them.

We live in such peace now that it is difficult to find an enemy upon
whom to try one’s lance, but I do not mind much, since my time is taken
with the care of my flocks and herds, the business of my people and the
training of Julian 21st, the son of a Julian and an Or-tis, who will one
day be Jemadar of all America over which, once more, there flies but a
single flag—The Flag.
