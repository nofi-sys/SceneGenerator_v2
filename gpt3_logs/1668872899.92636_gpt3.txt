SCENE:
XV.

DELECTABLE GLIMPSES BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

Now, with a bitter smile, whose light did shine
Like a fiends hope upon her lips and eyne.
SHELLEY


Turn we now to that large and mysterious house, to which we have before
referred, near the corner of Broadway and Eighth Street. We will pass
the greasy lintels, into the wide and dirty entry, climb those five
flights of stairs, turn down the long, dark passage, and pause before
a door, just one beyond that which we have had occasion to remember in
the course of this narrative.

We will take the liberty to enter. The scene presents the woman, Marie,
reclining on a lounge, holding a note in her hand, which she seems to
have read and re-read with a peculiar look of puzzled inquiry.

The impish-looking daughter, to whom we have before referred, was
seated in a chair, behind the womans head, and out of her sight. The
creature seemed to have much ado to keep from laughing outright, for
her face was screwed into all sorts of contortions in the effort to
subdue it, as she peeped over her mothers shoulder, and watched her
puzzled looks and bewildered gestures.

Well! said the mother, as if speaking to herself, if one could only
comprehend how he came to write this to meit seems to contain a great
deal. Upon my word, it appears a beautiful snatch of rhyme, and to
convey quite a confessiononly I dont understandit reads as if it
were an answer to something that had gone before. She reads

Angels a subtler _name_ may know,
But not a subtler _thought_ of joy
Could thrilling through a seraph go,
Than that your presence brought to cloy
And weigh my life down into calm,
With an unutterable sense
Like music perfumed with the balm
Of dews star-shedall too intense!

Most too high-strung for my purposes, it must be confessed! He never
expresses any flesh and blood in his correspondence. Ah, well, Ill
soon bring him out of that! But this really does puzzle me! This is all
the note contains. She turns the note to examine it. It is certainly
in his hand, yet he makes no explanation.

Here the child, whose blood seemed ready to burst through her face in
the continued effort to restrain her laughter, tittered aloud. The
mother sprang erect, and, turning upon her with an expression of rage
and surprise upon her face

What! Why, what are you laughing about? What business is this of
yours, pray?

The child, although evidently a little frightened, had so entirely lost
her self-control as to be unable to restrain the bursts of laughter
which now followed each other, peal upon peal, as she danced about the
room in a perfect ecstacy of glee.

The mothers face turned first pale and then red, as she followed the
motions of the child with her eye, until at last, with the expression
of an infuriate tigress, she sprang to seize her. The child was too
quick for her, and with the agility of a monkey, darted from beneath
her grasp; and still shrieking with laughter, was pursued around the
roomleaping the furniture with an airiness that defied pursuitwhich
her strange, wild laugh yet taunted.

The woman, after exhausting herself in vain attempts at catching
her, sank upon the loungeand at once, in a whining, fretful voice,
commenced to pour upon the head of the child, the most inconceivable
and galling epithets. So long as this tone was held, the child held
out in defiant spirit, either of sulking obstinacy, or of harsh and
irritating laughter, and to every reiterated question from the angry
motherWhat are you laughing at? What do you mean?she only clapped
her hands and danced more wildly to her elfin mirth.

The mother now changed her tone of a sudden, in seeming hopelessness of
carrying her point by storm. She began to sob violently, and turning
with streaming eyes towards the child

Youyou tre-treat your poor mother very cruelly to-day; I am dying
to know what it is you mean; but you will not tell me! Please, dear,
come and tell poor mother why you laugh, what it is you mean, and what
you know about this letter?for I am sure you know somethingdo tell
poor mother, and she will forgive you all! Come, dear child! and she
reached out her hand as if to clasp her to her bosom.

The child, who seemed to have no intellectual comprehension of the
meaning of all this, but to have taken a purely impish delight in
watching the confusion and puzzle of her mother, in regard to the
letter at first, and then instantly, when she flew into a rage, to
have answered in a monkeyish and hysterical rage, on her own part; now
at once, with equal promptness, and with the common instinct of young
animals, responded to the tender inflections of the maternal voice.
