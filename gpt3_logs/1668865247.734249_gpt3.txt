SCENE:
You are not here to tell us when the tide runs out, but to say how you
discovered the body of the deceased Jane Emily Walcheren, said the
coroner, consulting his papers.

Yes, yer worship. Well! as I and my mate here was a-haulin up the
boats, I says to him, I says, Bob, I says, what be that ere bundle
of white, I says, under the cliff? Blowed if I know, he says, it
looks like a sheet as has blowed over in drying, he says.

You are not here to tell the jury what your mate thought the body
looked like. You are to tell us how you found it.

Yes, sir. Well, sir, we thought it was a sheet, you see, but when
we went to pick it up, we see it was a young woman. So we lifted her
atween us and carries her to this ere ouse, and then my mate he
fetches Dr MColl. And thats all, sir!

Very good! Now, tell us, please, when you found the body was there no
one about?

Not a soul as we see, my lord--I mean, yer worship--the beach was
empty from hend to hend.

And the cliffs?

Didnt see a soul on the cliffs neither, yer worship.

You met no one on your way here? You are sure!

Quite sure, your honour! Twould be all over the town if we had!

Very well! You can sit down. Call Dr MColl!

The doctor, having been sworn, deposed that he had been called to the
Bottle and Spurs at about six oclock on Saturday night, to see the
deceased. She was then quite dead--had been dead for two or three
hours. There was a large bruise on the temple caused by her striking
against the rocks in her fall. That was of itself sufficient to have
caused death, but the spine was broken and the neck. The body was also
much bruised. There was no question but that the deceased had met her
death by falling over the cliffs.

Now, Dr MColl, I should like to put a few questions to you, if you
please, said Mr Procter, looking his very sharpest. Is it your
opinion that the deceased must inevitably have fallen over the cliffs
of her own accord? Might she not have been blown over, or pushed over,
or thrown herself over by design?

Certainly she might! It is impossible to say how she came to fall
over, but she _did_ fall over--that is beyond a question.

Ah! said the coroner, with self-satisfaction, as if he had discovered
a very knotty point. Then you consider death was due--

To dislocation of the spine from a fall over the cliffs.

Thats your opinion, is it? remarked the coroner, dubiously.

Yes, sir, thats my opinion, replied MColl shortly, as he retired.

The next witness was Crampton. He came tottering into the room, and
stood supporting himself on his silver-mounted cane.

You are, I believe, the father of the deceased, Mr Crampton, began
the coroner, scrutinising the old man through his eye-glasses.

I am, sir. She was my only child--the only one I had left.

And she was married on the Friday preceding her death?

She was, worse luck!

Was her marriage undertaken with your consent, Mr Crampton?

At this question, the old man became violently agitated.

It was not, sir. She was stolen from me by a villain, who came to my
house under the disguise of friendship, and--

Some one in the jury remarked that this was quite irrelevant to the
evidence on hand, but Mr Procter ordered him to be silent.

This poor gentleman has sustained a double injury, he said. Let him
tell his story in his own words.

I have not much more to say, gentlemen, resumed Mr Crampton. This
man, Frederick Walcheren, stole my daughter from me, and the next thing
I hear is that she is dead. It is not a long story, but it is a very
bitter one.
