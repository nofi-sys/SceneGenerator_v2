Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
He said something to a native in a ragged blue uniform, who looked like
a sweeper or a porter of the building.

Yes, it is so, he said. You shall rest awhile to consider the angel
on the tower and other matters. You shall have your hands free, so that
you can catch your lice. You will find some brother Inglays where you
are going.

Hi realised that he was going to be jailed.

Sir, Hi said, will you please let me go? I am not a subject of this
State.

Sir, we will please let him go, the officer said. He is not a subject
of this State.

The man in the blue rags led the way into the house. The officer ordered
the Indians to take Hi in after him. Hi was thrust along a hall into a
corridor, then across a yard, paved with concrete, to a low building or
shed, where the ragged man unlocked a door. When the door was opened, Hi
was flung through it. He went staggering for a couple of steps, stumbled
over a body which grunted, staggered on and trod upon a second body,
which roused up, cursed in English and subsided.

The door clicked to and the lock turned. The key was withdrawn and the
footsteps of the jailer passed away across the yard. A door closed
behind them. It seemed to Hi to shut him into an everlasting prison,
remediless. He apologised to the two bodies, on which he had trodden,
but had no answer, except drunken muttering.

I am jailed, he thought, locked up in a jail and cant get out. And I
cant tell when I shall get out. I may be here for days.

After a little time the room seemed less dark. He began to have
glimmerings of its shape. There was a grated opening high up which let
in air. A little grating in the door let him peer into the yard. It was
a biggish, long prison room about twenty-four feet by eight. There were
three people in it, a dead drunk man, a less drunk man and himself. The
dead drunk man was out of all knowledge of the world. The second, from
words uttered when trodden on, Hi judged to be a deserter from the Navy.

Peering through the grating, he could see little beyond except the four
concreted sides of the yard sloping to a central drain. An evergreen
stood in a tub at each corner of the yard. The slopes of the pent-houses
surrounding the yard kept him from sight of the heavens, but a glimmer
in the water of the drain showed that the stars were shining. He shook
at the door, which rattled a little. It was an iron slab. He was a
prisoner. And Carlotta is a prisoner, he thought. And how on earth is
Don Manuel to be warned? He saw no way. Theyve diddled us between
them, he thought.

While he stood at the little grating, rattling at the door, a great
tumult broke out at the lower end of the town where Hi had seen the
mansion. After twenty minutes of this he noticed that the pent-house on
his right began to take colour. A glow came upon the tiles. The racket
continued for half an hour. Theyre having a good old racket of
destruction, he thought. When he looked again through the grating, he
noticed that the glare upon the tiles of the pent-house had changed to a
glittering intermittence. I believe theyre burning the town, he
thought. If they are, we shall be burned like rats in a trap.

What say? a voice asked.

Hi looked round startled. He saw the second of the two drunkards sitting
up and looking at him. He was a littleish man with a flushed hatchet
face which shone in the light.

The towns on fire, Hi said; we may be burnt if they dont let us
out.

What say?

The towns on fire: we may be burnt.

Ere, let me come on deck.

He came on deck, a little unsteady on his legs and smelling very strong
of aniseed. Damn to hell, he said, when he had come on deck and looked
through the grating.

A bit of fair old, rare old, he said.

He turned on Hi suddenly to ask:

What you in for, mate?

Nothing. They shoved me in.

Thats me, to rights, he answered. Nothing: same ere. Burnings
pineful, too. Lets ave a look at that door. Say, mate, got a bit of
wire?


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Hi is jailed and finds himself in a room with two other drunkards. He
looks through the grating and sees that the town is on fire. He
wonders if they will be burned alive. The other drunkard wakes up and
Hi tells him what is happening. The drunkard tries to escape but is
unsuccessful.
