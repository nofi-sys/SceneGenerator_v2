Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
It was her assurances that quieted him. She had known from the first he
would tell as she had known from the first he had done it. He relaxed
and sank back, his eyes closing, and the doctor motioned them to go.
Flora followed them to the door and held them there a moment to repeat
what she had said--as if, like him, wanting to rid her mind of all its
secret agony. It wasnt surmise; she had seen him. When she had turned
from the water after her attempt to catch the body she had had a clear
view of him stealing through the pine wood, moving noiselessly and
watching the house.

He never knew it, she said. That night when you, Mr. Williams,
nearly caught me on the stairs, I was going to see him, say I knew what
hed done and that Id help him and lie for him and stand by him. Oh,
yes--I dont care what I tell now. He was my husband, Id loved him and
hed been cursed--cursed and destroyed.

The men closed the door softly as upon the dead. What they had heard
and left behind them had taken the zest from their accomplishment and
in the glow of the hall lights their faces looked drawn and hollowed
with fatigue. Rawson drew out his watch--half past two. The best thing
they could do was to get a little sleep. The day would be on them in a
few hours, there would be a lot of business to get through and he, for
one, was dead beat. They wouldnt take off their clothes, just turn in
on the sofa and divan, and stepping gently, as befitted a place where
so dark a doom had fallen, he and Williams passed into the library.

Sleep was far from Bassett. He would like to have seen Anne, but
it would have been inhuman to rouse her, and he went toward the
living-room where he could think in quiet. The screen still covered
by the sheet and the projector facing it were untouched and gave the
place the air of a scene set for a play. Silence brooded over the room,
a silence so peaceful and profound that it seemed as if the hideous
tumult of the last hour must be a nightmare illusion. He dropped into
a chair, his breath expelled with a groaning note, then heard Annes
voice from the gallery above:

Ive been waiting for you. May I come down?

There she was, dressed, leaning against the railing.

Come, he beckoned, his heart expanding, his depression lightened,
and as she disappeared he pulled up a chair for her. She came in,
soft-footed across the rugs, with the whispering words:

I couldnt rest till Id seen you and heard. Hes told?

Everything. They sat, facing each other, close together. Its solved
and ended--the Gull Island murder.

Is it all right for you to tell me?

It was all right and he told her.

She listened absorbed, eyes intent on his, now and then nodding her
head in confirmation of an agreement in her own mind. When he had
finished, she sat looking down, apparently lost in musing contemplation
of the story.

So, as it turns out, Anne dearest, all that misery you and I went
through was unnecessary.

Yes, she said slowly. It wasnt Joe, he wasnt in it at all. But
I dont understand. Ive been sitting in my room while you were with
Stokes thinking about it and I cant make it out. Hugh--she leaned
forward and rested her hand on his knee, dropping her voice though no
one was there to hear--this is what I cant explain--_whom_ did I see
in here last night?

Bassetts answer was prompt, delivered in the brisk tone of common
sense:

I can. Its very simple. You didnt see anybody.

Nobody?

Nobody. Ive been thinking about it, too. Theres only one
explanation, and thats it.

She looked beyond him at the lamp, her eyebrows drawn in a puzzled
frown:

You think I imagined it?

I know you did. Just consider:--You were in a wrought-up condition,
you expected to see him, came down for that purpose. The room was
almost dark, quite dark under the gallery where you say he came from.
After what youd gone through--first a murder, then a suspicion that
would have undermined the strongest nerves--you were in a state to see
anything.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with Bassett and Williams discussing the recent events. They are relieved that it is finally over, but are both exhausted. Rawson suggests they try to get some sleep.
Bassett is unable to sleep and goes to the living room to think. He is reminded of the night before when he saw Anne coming down the stairs. He is lost in thought when Anne appears, asking if she can come down.
He tells her everything that happened and she listens intently. When he is finished, she is thoughtful for a moment before asking him about the figure she saw the night before. Bassett explains that she only imagined it because she was in a highly emotional state.
