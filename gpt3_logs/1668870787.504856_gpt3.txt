SCENE:
VIII

_Theres an organ in the parlour,
Just to give the house a tone,
And youre welcome every evening,
At Maggie Murphys home._

HARRIGAN.


NOT many steps from St. Michaels is the Academy of the Sacred Heart,
where the girls of the parish are taught by the gentle-mannered
sisters; and not far from that again, was the home of Maggie Dwyer.
Time was, and not so many years before, when Owen Dwyer mixed the
mortar for McMullen the builder and lived in one of the little houses
in McGarragles Alley. But Owen made good wages and was a saving man
and a sober one. All his neighbours knew that he had an account in
the savings bank; but when he sent his daughter to the Normal School
and thereby showed that he had sufficient to educate and support her
it excited much comment; and when he bought the Second Street house,
and Fitzmaurice, the real estate man, caused it to be known that four
thousand dollars was the price paid, a cry of wonder went up, and the
old country tale of the finding of a crock of gold, began to be
whispered from one to the other.

And, although he shortly afterward gave up his job with McMullen, Owen
was still the same quiet, good-natured man, passing the collection
plate in the church on Sunday morning and acting as president of the T.
A. B. society, as he had been accustomed to do for years.

His daughter was his darling. Splendid, capable Maggie! whose fine eyes
and handsome form were the talk of all who knew her. Owen had some
influence in a political way, and after her graduation, Maggie was made
a teacher at the Harrison School; her strong young voice was soon heard
in the church choir; she sketched, embroidered, composed, and adorned
their pretty home with pictures, dainty bric-a-brac and other things
that a refined taste delights in, until Owen walked about the rooms in
awe, and admired with all his soul.

One evening about a week after the funeral at Murphys, Maggie, in a
close-fitting gown that displayed the splendid lines of her figure,
sat at her piano softly playing over some music which she was to use
at a concert of the teachers society; Owen read the evening paper and
smoked his brier pipe by the shaded lamp.

Im afeered, Maggie, said he, in a troubled tone, laying down the
paper, that these goings on av the Motor Traction Companyll bring
sorra till many a body yet.

What is it, Daddy? asked Maggie, pausing in her playing.

They do be after the franchise av the new company, answered Owen.
An the politicians are sidin wid em in their rascality. I have
put more money in this than I shud, added he, soberly, an iv the
franchise is revoked be the next set av councilmen, its in a bad way
well be, Maggie.

She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek, in the motherly fashion
that Owen loved.

Dont worry, Daddy, youll see that all will come right in the end.
And what matter, even if the stocks you own are made worthless; we
still have our home.

Bud we cant ate bricks an mortar, sure, complained he. An Im too
owld till go till work, now, Maggie.

But I am not, said Maggie, with a laugh. Why you have said yourself,
Daddy, that I earn more in a month than you ever did with Mr. McMullen.

Is it have me sponge on yez bit av wages yed have me do? exclaimed
the old man. God forgimme, Maggie, I couldnt do that.

The door bell rang at this moment.

Its Mr. Mason, I suppose, said Maggie. He told me that he would
drop in during the evening, and said that he wanted to speak to you.

But it was Annie Clancy, the grocers daughter, a quiet, pretty girl,
and a great favourite of Maggies.

I only came in to say that Mary Carroll is coming around to see you,
announced Annie. She said that she was afraid youd be goin out, so
she asked me to run around and tell you to wait.

An how is young McGonagle, Annie? asked Owen, banteringly.

Now, Daddy! warned Maggie, with uplifted finger.

What harm? persisted Owen, who delighted to twit the girl about her
sweetheart. Sure, they tell me, Annie, that he do sarve yez father wid
better milk than any av his other customers.
