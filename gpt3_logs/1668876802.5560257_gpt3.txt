SCENE:
Jimmy shrugged. Maybe so. But Id rather have a sure place on the
second, thanks. Gee, but Im tired!

Skiing?

Yes; Pete Gordon and Kelly and Gus and I. We climbed up to the
Observatory and then hiked half-way over to the Falls. It was piles of
fun going down the mountain. Gus Weston took a header and turned over
about forty-eleven times and then went into a snow bank head-first up
to his waist. But we tried to do too much. My legs feel as if theyd
never stop aching! What have you been doing? Been in here all the
afternoon? But, of course, you have. I forgot about your tooth. How is
it? Any better?

Yes. I guess I caught a little cold in it. I wish that dentist
chap would yank it out instead of practicing on it! Dud turned the
lights on and perched himself across a chair at the opposite side of
the table, his arms on the back, and observed Jimmy in a thoughtful
fashion. Jimmy grunted.

Shoot, he said. Whats on your mind?

IIve been wondering, Jimmy.

Oh, gee! Jimmy groaned deeply. At it again, eh? Well, what is
it this time, Dud? The other day you were worrying yourself thin
because you were afraid you were costing your folks too much money, or
something.

Dud smiled. Not exactly worrying, he replied. Justjust wondering.

There isnt much difference, the way you do it. If I

Not so much about how much I was costing them as whether theyre going
to get their moneys worth, Jimmy. Sometimes I wonder whether Im
really doing any good here. Now you look at it this way

I wont! I refuse! Besides, thats an old one. Whats your latest
worry?

It isnt a worryexactly. I was only thinking that He paused.
Then: Oh, I guess it isnt anything, after all. Say, youd better get
out of those wet things, Jimmy.

Im going to just as soon as I have strength to move. But I want to
hear your newerproblem, Dud. Come across. Fess up to your Uncle
Jimmy.

Dud hesitated, smiling a bit embarrassedly. He was a good-looking
chap of fifteen, with clean-cut features, a rather fair complexion
and very bright blue eyes. He was small-boned and slim, and, since
he had been doing a lot of growing the past twelve months, he looked
a trifle weedy. In that respect he was a distinct contrast to his
roommate, for James Townsend Logan was a stocky lad, wide of shoulder
and broad of chest. Jimmy was sixteen, although only four months
divided the two boys in age. Jimmys features were nondescript, but
the result was pleasing. He wore his red-brown hair rather longDud
said it was because he was too lazy to have it cut oftener than once
every termand had a short nose and a wide, humorous mouth and a very
square chin. He was a member of the upper middle class, while Dud was a
lower middler.

I guess its sort of silly, said Dud after a moment. But Ive been
wonderingJimmy groaned againwhy I dont know more fellows, Jimmy,
why I dontdont mix better. I dont believe I really care a whole
lot He paused again. Yes I do, too, though. Id like to have
fellows like me, Jimmy, as they do you, and ask me to do things and go
places andand all that. Of course, I know the troubles with me, all
right, butbut what is it?

Oh, piffle, Dud! Fellows _do_ like you.

Yes, about the way they like the steps in front of School Hall. That
is, they dont exactly _like_ me; they justjust dont _dislike_ me.
I guess Id rather have them do that than not care a fig whether Im
alive or dead. I suppose this sounds silly, but

Honest confession is good for the soul, responded Jimmy lightly. But
I think youre wrong about it, Dud. Or, anywaynow look here

I suppose Im just not cut out to be what you might call popular,
interrupted Dud thoughtfully. Well, but still

Shut up and let me talk! The trouble with you is that you dont let
fellows find out whether they can like you or not. You dontdont
mixdo you see? If youd get into things more

But thats just it! How can I when I see that Im not wanted?

Thats just imagination, Dud. You cant expect fellows to fall all
over themselves and hug you! Youve got to show em that youre ready
to be friends. Youve got to make the start yourself. What do you do
when someone says Lets do this or that? You mutter something about
having to dig Latin or math and sneak off. Fellows naturally think you
dont want to do the things they do. Now today, for instance


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Dud is worried that he doesn't mix well with other people and that they don't seem to like him very much. Jimmy tells him that he needs to show people that he wants to be friends and to make the first move himself.
