What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Seeing that she did not turn he pronounced her name. At that she
wheeled, lightning-quick, and came forward from beneath the deep jut of
the gallery assuming as unconcerned a manner as she could.

Lovely evening, she said as she advanced. Its been hard to come in.

Evidently from the length of time you stayed out there. Ive been
waiting for you.

It was not a propitious beginning, especially as he still stood against
the door as if intending to bar her exit.

Im going up-stairs to dress now.

Theres plenty of time. You can give me a few minutes. Ive something
I want to say to you.

Oh, Aleck! She stopped with an air of weary expostulation. _Dont_
say anything more. _Dont_ begin that dreadful subject. Im sick of it,
I loathe it and _cant_ you see it isnt any use?

He went on as if he hadnt heard her:

Ive been trying for days, ever since I came here. And you keep
avoiding me, always having some one with you. Now well be going
to-morrow, we may not have another chance, and I must see you and tell
you--he stopped and looked at the gallery. Did I hear a step up
there?

She had heard nothing and thought it odd that he should be so suddenly
cautious. Discretion had been the last quality he had heretofore shown.

I _have_ avoided you and Im going to continue doing it. Please move
away from the door. Its silly to stand in front of it for I can go
round by the garden, but Im tired and I dont want to.

He came forward, speaking as he advanced.

This isnt what you think. Im done with that. Youve made me
understand, youve got it across, Sybil. Im not going to bother you
any more with that subject you loathe and think so dreadful. But I
cant help loving you and wanting to help you. She gave an exasperated
gesture and made a move to pass him. As she did so, he said: Ive
heard something of Jim Dallas.

She stopped as if all animating force had been stricken out of her, a
What? expelled on a caught breath.

Just before I left town I met an actor who says he saw him.

Are you telling me the truth?

Why should I lie? What do I gain by it? I swore the fellow to secrecy
and came up here to tell you and Ive been trying----

She broke in: Was he sure? Where was it?

The change in her manner would have crushed the hope in any man.
Shunning him like a leper, she now drew close and laid her hand on his
arm.

I cant tell you here. Its too dangerous, too many people coming and
going.

It _was_ Jim?

It _was_. Its quite a story, more than just seeing him. But weve got
to get somewhere away from all these damned doors----

One of them opened--that into the hall behind them. They heard it and
wheeled round, faces sharp-set in defensive interrogation. It was
Flora Stokes. She rested on the threshold looking at them, and Stokes,
his senses more alert than the girls, withdrew his arm from her clasp.

Oh, Flora, he said, his voice supremely light and easy. Were you
looking for me?

Mrs. Stokes said no, she had come to put her book back. She walked
slowly to a table and placed her book on the corner. The room was very
still as she did this. Stokes, his hands deep in his pockets, moved
his head, following her progress as if it roused his curiosity. The
girl stood without a sound, the scene passing under her eyes with a
mirage-like unreality.

It seems Ive intruded, said Mrs. Stokes, each syllable meticulously
clear and precise. But if you want to be alone I should think youd
have chosen another place.

Having chosen this is a pretty good proof we didnt want to be alone,
retorted her husband.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the characters' true feelings for each other and to create tension between the husband and wife. The author achieves this by having the husband confront the wife about her avoiding him and by having the wife react angrily to his news about Jim Dallas.
