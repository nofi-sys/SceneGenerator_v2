SCENE:
"Ludwig von Hagen," she continued, "a certain day, four years ago, I
learned that an officer of the 7th Hussars had cheated at cards. It
meant death and dishonour to him. The next day that officer's debts were
paid, the affair was hushed up and he himself, selected by me for my
orderly officer, astonished the whole garrison by his strange and rapid
change of fortune. Remarks were passed to which I paid no attention. You
know yourself that the sole motive of my action was my wish to rescue
from infamy a brave young man, who bore a great name and in whom I
believed.

"He, on the other hand," she said, pointing to me, "not only owes me
nothing, but indeed suffered at first from my indifference, nay, scorn,
the result of unworthy suspicions. He never showed any resentment.
Quietly, secretly he has been working for me. Perhaps he himself does
not know the full meaning of what he has done. But he certainly knew he
was risking his life. And now the man who owes me everything has come to
arrest the man to whom I owe everything!"

Tears ran down the face of the little hussar.

"What do you wish me to do?" he murmured in a tremulous, hoarse voice.

"I want you to pay the debt you owe me," replied Aurora. "The time has
come and you cannot complain, for you have brought it on yourself."

"Give your orders," he said. "I will obey."

"Go downstairs and begin by sending your men away. Find some pretext
which won't be awkward for you later on.

"Now go to the garage," she said, when he came back. "There are still
some chauffeurs about. Make them get out the big grey with a full supply
of petrol. Don't light the lamps. Bring it down below yourself. It is
now twenty minutes to nine. Be there at ten to."

Aurora laid a map out on the table and studied it. "It's obviously
shorter by Aix-la-Chapelle and Belgium," she murmured, "but I know the
Wiesbaden-Thionville route better."

"Are you ready?" she said.

"What are you going to do?" I asked.

"Take you back to France, of course."

She added:

"I have put some money and a revolver in the pocket of your coat. You
can get anywhere with those."

Aurora was just beauty itself then, my friend. If you'd only seen her at
that moment you'd understand why I can't control my voice at this point.

There was a dull roar under the window. The _Benz_ was there.

"Come," said Aurora.

At that moment Hagen came in. His air of sullen annoyance had deserted
him now, I can tell you. He fell at the Grand Duchess's feet.

"You are going! You are going with him, for ever!" he murmured with a
sob in his voice.

She looked at him more kindly.

"If that is your idea, Herr von Hagen, it is all the more praiseworthy
of you to have obeyed. You may know, however, that I'm not going. I'm
bound to this place which I loathe by the task that still lies before
me. But for the moment my duty is to save him who has given up
everything for me."

"Oh, thank you! thank you!" said the young man.

"You had better wait a bit before thanking me," she said. "I presume,
Herr von Hagen, that you have your identity card and mobilization orders
on you?"

He rose, quivering with horror.

"My mobilization orders?" he repeated, deadly pale.

"Yes," she said calmly. "Oblige me by handing them over to Monsieur
Vignerte. We might be stopped between here and the frontier. Of course
I know that in all probability I shall only have to mention my name to
get through. But we might come across some stupid sentry. We must not
lose any time. Lieutenant von Hagen will be able to get anywhere. Come.
Quick!"

The officer was white as death. A terrible conflict was raging within
him.
