What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
A man, wrapped in a pea-jacket, came down a ladder swiftly, squinted at
a yellow tissue, then started along the starboard side of the ship. Fay
realized it was the captain, although the braid on his cap was
inconspicuous.

He followed him until he reached a midship boat. He stood in the shelter
of this and saw a steward come forward. The two men, dimly discerned
under the yellow glow of the overhead deck-lights, were pointing toward
a cabin door. Fay started with surprise. It was his own door!

The steward tried the brass-knob, rapped once, bent his head and
listened with his left ear to the panel. He straightened and shook his
head as the captain struck the tissue with impatient knuckles.

An oath in Norwegian rolled along the ship. Fay came out from the shadow
of the boat and sauntered forward. He rounded the bay of the pilot-house
and hurried aft without glancing back. He stood, finally, at the rail
which overlooked the stern of the vessel.

His brain worked swiftly and toward one point. The captain had received
a wireless message. The message concerned himself. For no other reason
would the steward have knocked on the door of the cabin.

The context of this message might prove embarrassing. Scotland Yard had
a long arm. It had dragged him out of a Dartmoor cell. It had pressed
him on in the mission to Holland. Now, perhaps, it was reaching again,
and this time for revenge and deeper incarceration.

Fay smiled with thin bitterness. He was on the eve of a discovery. The
captain might make an arrest at any moment. Visions of chains and
brigs and well-guarded cabins came to him. He stared forward where he
had last seen the captain.

The fog had been reached. It wreathed the ship in clammy folds. The
spars, the rails, the outswung boats, the white life-preservers, were
dripping with yellow drops. The siren blared its warning signal. The
knife-like bow of the ship slit through the curtain like a sabre through
cloth.

Hurtling onward, the ship seemed a shadow within a shadow. The hissing
waves under the counter, the thrash of the single screw, the clank of
shovels on the stoke-hold plates heard through the ventilatorsall
drove a resolve within Fays breast. He cursed the day he had ever heard
of the cipher or the cipher-key. He wanted freedom and a shielding
distance away from the menacing hand of the Yard. He decided to crawl
into a life-boat, draw the tarpaulin, and remain there until he could
signal to Saidee Isaacs. He reached upward and lifted himself to the
blocks of the after port boat whose davits were swung outboard.

The stiff canvas was laced by stout rope-yarn. It would have to be cut
in order to lift a flap sufficiently large enough to crawl through. He
reached for his knife. He turned his head at a sound which was blown
from forward. He sprang down and leaned over the rail in an attitude of
deep contemplation of the sea and fog.

Saidee Isaacs glided to his side. She pressed her hat against his cap as
she said tersely:

I only got away from the game for a minute. I cant make it out. Heres
a deck of the cards which we were using. Look them over, Chester. They
seem all right. I have got to put the deck back or it will be missed.

His glasses? asked Fay. What kind are they? I couldnt see from the
port-hole.

Theyre very thick and smoky. Saidee Isaacs glanced apprehensively
forward. Theyre thick, Chester. I can hardly see his eyes through
them. He said that they had been weakened by a mustard-gas attack at
Ypres.

Fay rapidly scanned the back of the cards, then turned them over and
held them toward the light from a deck-bulb.

He never was nearer Ypres than London or Calais, he said, shuffling
the deck by a practiced motion. Hes an awful liar!

The girl clutched his sleeve and narrowed her dark eyes. Hurry! she
said. Is there anything wrong with the cards? Hes won three hundred
pounds from that Russian. How does he do it?

Fay bunched the cards and ran his fingers over their edges. He replaced
them in the box and handed the box back to the girl.

I dont know, he said, glancing squarely at her. Theres nothing
wrong with the cardsno edge-work, no marking on the back, no
pin-pricks. The lights good here. I didnt see a thing wrong. Its in
the glasses he wears.

She started away and toward the bow.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:
