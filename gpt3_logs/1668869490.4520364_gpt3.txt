Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
"I do not know what happened to you, nor what happened to that crowd of
mutineers. I was 'fore the mast in that bark, and remember you; but I
have known you lately merely as a man-of-all-work around this building.
I owe you a dollar for cleaning up my place"--our visitor raised his
hand deprecatingly--"and we called you Bill. You couldn't remember
your last name, nor very far back. You went crazy aboard that bark,
Mr. Mayhew, and we put you ashore, still crazy, at Cape Town. I know
nothing more."

"Nor does anyone else?" The look on his face was piteous.

"I doubt that you can gather up the threads. Why should you wish to?
You must have lived a life of misery and hard labor. You were shocked
into fainting by the sight of a picture, right here in this studio, and
you have awakened to intelligence and mental activity."

"What picture?"

For answer I arose and wheeled the easel around so that the painting
faced him. The effect upon him was more startling than had been the
same experience upon my friend.

"Oh, God, help me!" he almost screamed. "God have mercy upon my soul!
Why must it be perpetuated? Have I not suffered enough?" He covered his
face with his hands, and with some misgiving I covered the picture with
a cloth.

"That was it," he continued. "That was the last I remember on board
that bark, and the first in the hospital the other day. I killed seven
human beings--I, an ordained minister of the gospel!"

"Steady, sir," answered my neighbor, rising and laying a reassuring
hand upon his shoulder. "You killed only six--how, I don't know--six
bloodthirsty cutthroats who would have killed you if they'd had their
way."

"But one was innocent," answered Mr. Mayhew, uncovering his moist eyes.
"The young fellow in the clutch of the big negro."

"That was myself, and I am very much alive. In fact, Mr. Mayhew, you
saved my life. You killed the nigger, but I simply fell down to the
deck. Then I came aft and helped carry you below. Look here?" He lifted
the cloth, and pointed to the face of the man held poised over the
negro's head. "That's me. Never mind who painted this picture, but look
here." He displayed the tintype. "Taken at the end of that voyage,"
he continued, "and still in my possession. No doubt, Mr. Mayhew, your
mind gave way under the shock of the experience, and it returned to
you when you looked at the reproduction. Now, don't worry about it any
more. You did right to quell that mutiny."

"Perhaps--according to most standards. But I was a minister, and my
conscience was already active enough from my devotion to science to the
neglect of my clerical work. But perhaps you are right. I'll try and
not worry."

I joined in with what encouragement I could offer, and when he had
calmed somewhat my neighbor said: "You must tell me how you did it,
Mr. Mayhew. You killed six worthless heathen, and saved the lives of
several white men, by some application of intense cold. I am a student
of science, but I cannot understand."

"Very simple," answered our guest. "You know that cold is merely
negative heat, and, if reduced to a point, will act like heat,
decreasing in strength as the square of the distance."

The old artist chuckled. "I knew it," he said. "Go on."

"And do you notice that the reflector in the picture has the elliptical
curve, instead of the parabolic of the usual reflectors?"

I gasped. In painting that object into the picture I had not thought of
curves. In fact, knew nothing of conic sections at the time.

"The secondary focus of that reflector," went on Mr. Mayhew, "was about
sixty feet away. I had designed it for experimenting with light. In
fact, I had invented the searchlight, now in general use, as I have
learned by reading up lately. But I have also learned more--that in the
fifty years of my darkness the scientific world has not caught up to
me. At that time I had not only liquefied the six refractory gases of
Clerk Maxwell, but had solidified hydrogen and discovered in advance a
gas which I had not named, but which I now find is called helium. I
had also succeeded in liquefying this gas."

"And in the focus of that reflector?" inquired the old artist, half
rising from his chair.

"Was a small cup of liquefied helium, on which floated a lump of
solid hydrogen. It produced a temperature of nearly two hundred and
seventy-three minus centigrade--the absolute zero of space."


BRIEF OUTLINE:

-A man named Mr. Mayhew visits an old artist friend, and tells him about his life since they last saw each other
-Mr. Mayhew explains how he killed six mutineers on a ship using a reflector and liquefied helium
-The old artist is amazed, and Mr. Mayhew tells him that he has invented the searchlight and discovered a new gas, which is now called helium
