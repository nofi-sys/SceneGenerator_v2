Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
An the divil go wid ye, exclaimed Clancy, savagely, as he resumed
his work upon the crate of eggs.

Aint ye goin to church this mornin, Pop? called Annie, from an
inner room.

Faith an I am, answered her father, rising hurriedly, and slipping
off his apron. Its bad luck enough Im havin widout missin me juty.
What time is it, asthore?

It wants ony a few minutes.

Clancy put on his coat. It wur a black day, he muttered, as he
started off, when I borryed that money av Malachi OHara. The owld
villyanll keep his word, bad luck till him; its in a trench wid a
pick Ill be, afore the weeks out.

After leaving Rosie and Larkin, Larry Murphy headed straight for
OHaras; but he had scarce gone a half block when he encountered
Kerrigan and Mason, who had just paused before Owen Dwyers door. Mason
grasped the young mans hand and shook it warmly.

I am delighted that you have made such a splendid fight against
McQuirk, said he.

It aint McQuirk, so much, said Larry. Kellys the man Im after.

Were just going in to see Owen Dwyer, about the delegates for his
division, said Kerrigan. Wont you come in? Hell want to see you, I
know.

Owen had seen the trio from the window and had opened the door in time
to catch these words.

Come in, Larry, said he cordially. Its a stranger yeve made av
yezsilf long enough.

Owen had asked him to visit them many times before, but Larry had never
done so because of the fear that Maggie would think he was forcing
himself upon her, and this his pride would not permit. He was reluctant
to enter even now, but somehow there was also a feeling of gladness in
his being unable to refuse.

He sat upon the edge of the chair that Owen offered him, stole covert
glances about the parlour and earnestly hoped that Maggie was not at
home. A glance at the clock showed him that it was but shortly after
eight, and he wonderingly confessed to a sense of satisfaction in the
knowledge that school did not begin until nine. Owen settled his doubts
by poking his head through the hangings of a doorway, and calling:

Maggie, asthore; can ye come here for a minyute? Sure, its company
were after havin so airly in the mornin.

Maggie entered the room, obediently; she flushed a little at sight of
Larry, but managed to greet him in a calm, even voice that betrayed
nothing of what she might feel.

She talked to him of neighbourhood events, he answering awkwardly and
distantly, as he always did with her. Her father had plunged into an
earnest discussion, with the others, of the coming convention, and
finally swept them out of the room to look at some figures which he
had compiled, bearing upon the comparative strength of the opposing
factions.

There was a short silence after this; and, at length Maggie said:

I have wanted so to speak to you lately, but you are such a stranger!

A little thrill ran through Larry at these words. She had thought of
_him_, then; and he fancied that he caught a note of vexation in her
voice. He pondered this, confusedly, and did not reply. She continued:

I wanted to tell you how sorry I was at your great loss. Mary was a
sweet and good girl.

Thats right, said he, eagerly. There aint many like her, is there?

No! answered Maggie, gently.

She was too good for me, said he, soberly.

Though Maggie did not agree with him in this, she did not say so. And
this is why: She had been a constant visitor during Marys illness,
and the sorrow that had grown so upon the sick girl toward the end had
not escaped her. Little by little she grasped the causes of this and
realized why Larry had asked Mary to be his wife. She had laboured
strenuously to persuade the gentle girl that love alone had been his
motive, but without success. Though she had loved Larry from the
days of her girlhood--and this Maggie had confessed to herself long
before--still her heart was great enough to appreciate what he had
endeavoured to do; and all the more because it proved him to be as
noble as she had always believed him.
