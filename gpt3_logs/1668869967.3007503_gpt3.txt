What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
"I suppose so," she rejoined, with a pout. Then, rising, she added: "If
you are going to talk in your sleep, I'm going to listen, and I'll know
all about your love affairs, remember that."

And with this truly feminine disposition of the question, she went to
bed.

Beverton secured a broom from the kitchen and, reaching up, unhooked
the carving-set and examined each piece carefully. The fork was a
fork, the steel a steel, the knife a knife--simple in design and
workmanship--such as could be found in any hardware store; but
the knife possessed one slight peculiarity that his questioning
eye noticed. Though it was ground in the conventional bowie-knife
shape, yet the blade as a whole had more curve than is usual in
carving-knives, while the long concave in the back of the blade,
near the point, was very short and deep. A further exaggeration of
these peculiarities would have given the blade the look of a Moorish
scimitar; but, even so, would have carried no occult significance to
Beverton's mind, and as it certainly did possess an unpleasant and
material connection with the problem before him, he decided to remove
it. Putting on his hat and overcoat, he took the three pieces out to
the back yard and hurled them, one by one, over the fence into a deep
snow-drift. Then he returned and, as was his custom, read until sleepy.

It was two hours later before the desired condition arrived, and laying
down his book, he discovered that he had not bolted his untrusty wife
in her room. He arose and looked in, only to see that her bed was
empty. He called, but she did not answer, and, thoroughly awake now,
he ran through the rooms of the house, but did not find her. As he
reached the dining-room, however, to don his hat and coat, he saw her
enter from the kitchen. She was in her nightdress, which was wet with
clinging snow; in her eyes was the lightless stare of somnambulism, and
in her hand the knife. In spite of his temperament, Beverton shivered
as he watched her expressionless stare, then remembering his friend's
instructions, pulled himself together, and said:

"Drop that knife. Drop it at once."

The knife clattered on the floor; he advanced, picked it up, and placed
it on the sideboard. Then he faced her, calm and determined, resolved
to solve the problem.

"Why do you walk in your sleep?" he demanded. She stood quiescent
before him; and though her features moved with inward emotion, she did
not reply.

"Why do you walk in your sleep?" he again demanded. "Answer me."

"To save myself," she said, slowly, and in plaintive, aggrieved tones.

"From whom?" asked Beverton.

"From my enemy--who would kill me."

"Who is your enemy? Why would he kill you?"

"I do not know. I know I must kill him, or he will kill me."

"This is nonsense," said Beverton, sternly, warming to the problem.

"Nonsense?" Her face seemed troubled, as though the mind behind was in
doubt.

"Rank nonsense. No one would harm you. Everyone loves you. What makes
you think he would kill you?"

"He tried." The set face of the young wife took on an expression of
fright and horror. "He met me when I was looking for him, trying to
explain. He clutched me by the throat. He would have killed me if he
could. He will kill me yet if I cannot explain."

"When did he choke you?" asked Beverton. "Where was it?" he asked,
with perspiration starting from his forehead and an incident of his
childhood in his mind.

"In the hall--the long hall."

"He was a baby," ventured Beverton. "How could he harm you?"

She waited a moment, as though the question puzzled her, then said:

"A baby, yes. I was a baby, too."

"Where was this long hall?"

Again the play of emotion on her features, but no answer.

"Was it in a hotel?"

"A hotel, yes."


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Beverton's wife as a somnambulist, and to introduce the idea that she is being threatened by an unknown enemy. The author achieves these goals by having the wife walk in her sleep and talk about her enemy.
