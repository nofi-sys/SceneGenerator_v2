Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
IX.


The next morning Henry Hindes received a scrawl, in a hand which he
could not recognise as that of Mr Cramptons, containing but three
words, Come to me.

He guessed at once what they meant. He had just returned from church
with his wife and elder children. He had not dared to refuse to go, for
he was a regular attendant there, and the omission would have looked
peculiar. So he had stood and knelt and sat through a service of two
mortal hours, whilst his eyes gazed into space and his mind was a
blank, and he only followed mechanically what the others said or did.

He walked home with Hannah on his arm and Elsie and Laurie trotting
before them, for the Hindes were far too strict a family to have out
their horses on a Sunday, but all the while that acquaintances were
bowing and smiling and exchanging civilities with himself and his wife,
he was wondering how soon the news would reach Hampstead, and if it
would come by telegraph or post, or if Walcheren would send a special
messenger to break it to the old people at The Cedars. And as soon as
he re-entered his own house, the note was handed to him with the fatal
words Come to me! He knew then that the worst was known--that the
poor parents had been told of their bereavement, and that it was his
mission to fly to comfort them.

What can be the matter? questioned Hannah. Can they have already
heard from Jenny, or do you think it possible she can be in Hampstead?
Oh, Henry! if they meet, surely Mr Crampton cannot refuse to speak to
her!

I know no more than you do, he answered, but I suppose I must go!
The old man may have been taken ill. He looked bad enough for anything
yesterday evening.

Oh! certainly, Henry dear, you must go at once, and you can take your
luncheon with them. But I shall be impatient to hear what he wants you
for. If Jenny should be there--oh, Henry, you _will_ let me know, wont
you? for I should love to give the dear girl a kiss, and assure her of
my faithful friendship. You will send someone over to tell me, in that
case, wont you, dearest?

Yes, yes; of course I will, he answered, quickly, but there is no
likelihood of such a thing. Good-bye, I had better be off at once.

And so he left her. The scene he encountered at The Cedars is easier
imagined than described. Mr Crampton received him in his library, in
the presence of his wife, and sister-in-law, and Dr MColl. The old
man looked as if he had suddenly crumpled up. His features were drawn
and shrivelled, and his complexion the colour of parchment. His wife
was laid face downwards on a couch at the further end of the room,
stupefied with the shock of the news they had just heard, whilst Miss
Bostock sat by her, silent and motionless, with her hands hanging
passively on her lap. No one stirred except the doctor, as Henry
Hindes, white and trembling, but with the assumption of being at his
ease, entered the room.

Well, my dear friend, he commenced cheerily, what is it?

Mr Crampton turned to the doctor, and muttered in a croaking voice,
Tell him.

I have the misfortune to be the bearer of very bad news to Mr and
Mrs Crampton, sir, said Dr MColl, in obedience to his instructions.
Their daughter, Mrs Walcheren, met with a terrible accident on the
Dover cliffs yesterday afternoon, and is, in fact--has not recovered
the injuries inflicted--is lying at this moment--dead!

Henry Hindes face went crimson instead of pale.

Dead, sir! he ejaculated slowly, as if he were choosing his words,
are you sure she is dead? An accident? How can you tell it was an
accident? Might not someone have done it on purpose--have pushed her
over?

Then he paused, as if he thought he had been talking too fast, and
repeated his first question: But are you sure that she will not
recover? She is very young, you know, after which, perceiving the
grief of all around him, he broke down, exclaiming, Oh! Jenny dead!
Impossible! Impossible! Why, I went to see her only yesterday! She
cant be dead! my dear, dear friend! seizing old Cramptons hand;
dont give way! It is impossible!

You are only buoying this gentleman up with false hopes, sir, said Dr
MColl. There is no doubt of the truth of the news, distressing as it
may be, and I am commissioned by Mr Walcheren to break it to all whom
it may concern. As to your suggestion that it may be due to foul play,
there is nothing whatever to point to it, but it will cause the subject
of the inquiry at the inquest to-morrow. Your presence will, of course,
be necessary, also Mr Cramptons. I understand, as you say yourself,
that you went down to Dover yesterday to see the unfortunate lady, so
that your testimony may be valuable to the coroner, and the marriage
having been, I am told, a little irregular, there is the more necessity
that everything should be made perfectly clear.
