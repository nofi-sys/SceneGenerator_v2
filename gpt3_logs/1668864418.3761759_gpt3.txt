SCENE:
Julie quickened her pace nervously, walking with averted eyes.

Widowers, now, Mrs. Anderson pursued, Theyre broke to double
harness already--they aint so hard to drive as a colt.

She suddenly collapsed in mirth. Magine you drivin a colt husband,
Julie! she giggled. Dont walk so fast, dearie; you put me all out er
breath. Well, anyhow, I think widowers are real nice. I aint got one
thing against em. I just believe Ill make the match between you and
Brother Seabrook. You like his looks all right, dont you?

Julie had fallen into a frozen silence. But her companion was
inexorable.

Dont you, dearie? Dont you like his looks? she persisted.

I--I havent thought anything about how he looks, Julie stumbled,
unhappily.

I blieve hed like you, too, Mrs. Anderson went on. Big men like
him are mighty apt to take to little scary women like you. An youd
make him a real good wife, Julie. I will say for you, youre bout the
best cook in town. You get that from your mother; she always set the
prettiest table--you recollect, Julie?

Again Julie was silent. The remembrance of her mother informed all her
life, but it was not possible for her to speak of it to Mrs. Anderson.

Well, of course Brother Seabrook would rather have you keepin his
house an raisin his children for him than that soured-faced old
aunt hes got now. An you wouldnt give him a speck er trouble; you
wouldnt kick over the traces, would you? Magine you kickin over
anything, Julie! Again Mrs. Anderson was convulsed with mirth, but
this time she was interrupted. Oh, mercy! Them old teeth! she cried,
clapping her hand to her mouth. My! But they certainly did take a
spiteful nip at my tongue that time. Yes, sir, she continued, Im
certainly goin to make that match if I live. Ill commence right this
evenin by bringin you to his notice. Ill tip him off to call on you
to pray.

Oh, no! Julie burst out. Oh, please, Mrs. Anderson--please dont do
anything like that! You know I never do lead in prayer. I cant do it.
I never could. Brother Mead knew I couldnt--and old Brother Johnston,
too--mother told them privately, and they never called on me. Ill
do anything to help the church--anything I can. But I cant lead in
prayer, Mrs. Anderson; you know I cant! I never could.

Well, now, its time you learned. You been a member in the Methodist
church too long not to be able to pray, Julie. Why, whatll folks think
if it gets about you cant pray? Why, prayers just the very foundation
of the church. Whats the matter?

Julie had stopped. Im not going to prayer-meeting this evening, she
faltered. Ive got to go back. I--I dont feel so very well.

Mrs. Anderson laid firm hands upon her. Thats perfect nonsense,
she cried. You got to go. Why, this is Brother Seabrooks first
prayer-meeting. Everybodyll think its awful funny if you aint there
to welcome him.

Im not going, Julie protested, trying to twist herself free of the
large hand on her wrist. I--I--Oh, you know I cant lead in prayer!
If he calls on me, Ill not be able to say one word--an everybodyll
laugh.

Julie! You a Methodist an cant pray?

Ill die if he calls on me, Julie cried, on the verge of tears.

Oh, no, you wont. Folks dont die that easy. Whats the matter with
you, anyhow, Julie? Mrs. Anderson interrupted herself suddenly. Why,
now I come to recollect, I heard you pray once, an it was just grand.
It was the time we had that big revivalist here--remember? Why, you was
just wonderful that night.

I know--I remember, Julie returned hurriedly. But that was
different. I was just carried away that night. Something got hold of
me--it sort of swept me out of myself. I--I wasnt there that night. It
was his preaching, I reckon. It seemed to set me free. She broke off,
a sudden bravery brought momentarily to her face by the remembrance.
But--but that was different, she hurried on. I couldnt do it now.
Please let me go.

But the other was inexorable.

Youve prayed once an you can pray again, she persisted. An it
would be awful for you not to be there for Brother Seabrooks first
prayer-meeting. If you struggle now, Julie, itll look like I was
draggin you to church, an whatll folks think of that?


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is very formal and old-fashioned. The dialogue is stiff and formal, and the characters seem to be very proper and well-mannered. There is a sense of tension and unease throughout the scene, as Julie is clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leading the prayer and is trying to find a way to get out of it.
