SCENE:
Madame Torialli gave a little cry of surprise and delight, and sprang
forward to meet her, while Jean, after a hasty glance at the new
arrival, turned into the adjoining room. The new rough paper Madame had
mentioned was on her desk, and Jean sat there, as he often did to write
her notes for her.

The door was open between the two rooms, for the night was hot. As for
Madame Torialli, the new arrival had swept poor Jean as completely from
her mind as if he were an autumn leaf before a gale. It was not every
day that Salvi came unannounced to call upon her.

La Salvi had advanced into the room, with all the air of expecting to
be met which marks a royal personage. For in Paris Salvi was royalty.
She had the greatest voice in the world and she had ruled it for twenty
years. She was a big, fat woman with a large red wig; tucked under her
arm she carried a small King Charles spaniel, which yapped dolefully.
He was also too fat, and was addicted, like his mistress, to sweet
cakes and cream. Unfortunately his resemblance ended there, for though
he used his voice quite as much as she did, he was not so gifted in its
timbre.

My dear! what a surprise and what a pleasure! And how well you are
looking! cried Madame Torialli. But fancy not telling me though!
Think if I had had the misfortune to be out!

Madame Salvi sat down with a doubtful glance at the slim delicate
chair-legs before she answered. The dog yelped and she panted.

I didnt know I was coming myself, she explained at length. How
was I to imagine, when I had left particular orders with the servants
always to expect me back at any moment, that the cook should have gone
to his mothers funeral!

My dear, have you had anything to eat? But how shocking! exclaimed
Madame Torialli, with sympathy.

Yes, thanks, I went to a restaurant. I had a man in the motor. It
doesnt matter, dear. Ive sent him away now, but I might have been
alone; if I had been, consider how I should have bored myself. Salvi
shuddered.

Jean, looking up from his writing-table, thought it was like the
shudder of an enormous jelly fish.

The thoughtlessness of that class of person! said Salvi, with
righteous indignation. And of all things what I dislike most is to
hear any talk of funerals!

Yes, my dear, I quite understand, murmured Madame Torialli,
soothingly. Let us talk of something pleasanter. Who was the man in
the motor?

Only my doctor, said Madame Salvi, still gloomily. Hes a new one,
the last one interfered with my diet; it was terrible, I suffered
agonies; he said pastry was bad for the voice, as if I hadnt eaten it
for twenty years! This one is an improvement; he says the great thing
is to go on doing what you like, and only to stop when it becomes
inconvenient. He says, too, that I ought always to wear green, or
certain shades of yellow with black; they effect the nerves favourably.

But, my dear, arent they your favourite colours? asked Madame
Torialli.

Yes, said Salvi. Thats what makes it so convenient. Still I thought
I had better be on the safe side, so I ordered ten new dresses to-day.
Madame Salvi was not telling the truth, but then her friend did not
suspect her of it; she only told the truth when she had nothing more
picturesque to tell.

But, my love, what riches! cried Madame Torialli.

On the contrary, what poverty! said Madame Salvi. I shall have to
economize; I shall leave my bills unpaid!

How free you are! said Madame Torialli sighing. For me, my husband
utterly refuses to buy me a new motor until next quarter day. I think
it is so foolish! After all, I say to him, one need not pay for
it immediately, and by next quarter day I shall, perhaps, be wanting
something else. Have you heard that our good Louis has just built
himself a magnificent set of new rooms, and is to give a ball in them
on Saturday week? I cant think how he can afford it; but Torialli and
I can never afford anything; we live like the little birds!

Madame Salvi laughed rather maliciously.

Like the little birds who have feathered their nests, you should say!
she replied.

Madame Torialli gave a graceful gesture of denial.
