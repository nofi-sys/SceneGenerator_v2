SCENE:
Take care, Charlie, said his mamma; we do not know enough to feed
young birds. We must leave it to their papa and mamma, who probably
started out bright and early in the morning to get breakfast for them.

Sure enough, while they were speaking, back came Mr. and Mrs. Robin,
whirring through the green shadows of the apple-tree; and thereupon all
the five little red mouths flew open, and the birds put something into
each.

It was great amusement, after this, to watch the daily feeding of the
little birds, and to observe how, when not feeding them, the mother
sat brooding on the nest, warming them under her soft wings, while the
father-bird sat on the tip-top bough of the apple-tree and sang to them.
In time they grew and grew, and, instead of a nest full of little red
mouths, there was a nest full of little, fat, speckled robins, with
round, bright, cunning eyes, just like their parents; and the children
began to talk together about their birds.

Im going to give my robin a name, said Mary. I call him Brown-Eyes.

And I call mine Tip-Top, said Jamie, because I know hell be a tip-top
bird.

And I call mine singer, said Alice.

I all mine Toddy, said little Toddlie, who would not be behindhand in
anything that was going on.

Hurrah for Toddlie! said Charlie, hers is the best of all. For my
part, I call mine Speckle.

So then the birds were all made separate characters by having each a
separate name given it. Brown-Eyes, Tip-Top, Singer, Toddy, and Speckle
made, as they grew bigger, a very crowded nestful of birds.

Now the children had early been taught to say in a little hymn:

Birds in their little nests agree,
And tis a shameful sight
When children of one family
Fall out, and chide, and fight;

and they thought anything really written and printed in a hymn must be
true; therefore they were very much astonished to see, from day to day,
that _their_ little birds in their nests did _not_ agree.

Tip-Top was the biggest and strongest bird, and he was always shuffling
and crowding the others, and clamoring for the most food; and when Mrs.
Robin came in with a nice bit of anything, Tip-Tops red mouth opened so
wide, and he was so noisy, that one would think the nest was all his. His
mother used to correct him for these gluttonous ways, and sometimes made
him wait till all the rest were helped before she gave him a mouthful;
but he generally revenged himself in her absence by crowding the others
and making the nest generally uncomfortable. Speckle, however, was a
bird of spirit, and he used to peck at Tip-Top; so they would sometimes
have a regular sparring-match across poor Brown-Eyes, who was a meek,
tender little fellow, and would sit winking and blinking in fear while
his big brothers quarrelled. As to Toddy and Singer, they turned out to
be sister birds, and showed quite a feminine talent for chattering; they
used to scold their badly behaving brothers in a way that made the nest
quite lively.

On the whole, Mr. and Mrs. Robin did not find their family circle the
peaceable place the poet represents.

I say, said Tip-Top one day to them, this old nest is a dull, mean,
crowded hole, and its quite time some of us were out of it; just give us
lessons in flying, wont you, and let us go.

My dear boy, said Mother Robin, we shall teach you to fly as soon as
your wings are strong enough.

You are a very little bird, said his father, and ought to be good and
obedient, and wait patiently till your wing-feathers grow; and then you
can soar away to some purpose.

Wait for my wing-feathers? Humbug! Tip-Top would say, as he sat
balancing with his little short tail on the edge of the nest, and looking
down through the grass and clover-heads below, and up into the blue
clouds above. Father and mother are slow old birds; keep a fellow back
with their confounded notions. If they dont hurry up, Ill take matters
into my own claws, and be off some day before they know it. Look at those
swallows, skimming and diving through the blue air! Thats the way I want
to do.

But, dear brother, the way to learn to do that is to be good and
obedient while we are little, and wait till our parents think it best for
us to begin.

Shut up your preaching, said Tip-Top; what do you girls know of
flying?
