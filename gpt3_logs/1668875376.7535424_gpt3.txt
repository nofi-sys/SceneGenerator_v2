Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
She and Stephen had never been very good friends--indeed at the
Grange he had disliked her, and she had never felt for him any warmer
sentiment than pity, mingled with contempt for the slavish nature of
his devotion to Lilian. His unselfish worship of the cold, proud girl
had its nobler side, she knew; but she could not forgive the meanness
of the actions to which he would stoop for his cousins sake. But, now
that Lilian had cast him aside like an old glove, and he appeared
before Annie broken in health and forlorn, the tears came into her eyes
as she thought of his wasted life, and she would have done anything in
the world to smooth his rough lot for him by her sympathy or her care.
But he shrunk from both, and left her each time dejected but stubborn,
with the shy reserve which characterized his attitude toward most
people even more marked than usual in his conversations with her.

She was feeling rather heart-sick at her inability to do anything for
the members of her husbands family, from most of whom she had received
great kindness, when one day she saw Sir George getting out of a hansom
in Piccadilly. He was looking careworn and harassed, Annie thought; but
he seemed glad to see her; and, when she begged him to come to luncheon
the next day he said he should be delighted, but she must be prepared
to find him more of a bore than ever.

Well, if you bore me, I shall take the privilege of an old
acquaintance and go to sleep, said she, laughing.

The next day he appeared punctually in her sitting-room, and she was
even more struck than she had been on the previous day by the deep
lines in his handsome face and the cloud which seemed to hang over
him. She exerted herself as she had never done before to be lively and
amusing; she had prepared the daintiest of luncheons, and before it was
over she had the satisfaction of hearing him laugh like a man without
a care. Not a particle of this delicate welcome was lost upon the keen
man of the world, and, when luncheon was over, he said:

That is the first meal I have laughed over for more than two
months--since you left the Grange, in fact.

Is it? said Annie, carelessly, as she refilled his glass.

Yes; and I suppose you know that as well as I do. You have the _ars
celare artem_, like the accomplished actress you are off as well as
on the stage; but I know you inveigled me here to-day with the base
intention that your wit and your wine should get into my head, and make
me forget for a little while my cares and my difficulties.

And, if wit and wine never fulfilled a worse mission than that, they
would not be so ill spoken of, said Annie, gently.

Well said! Why did you leave us, Annie? You were the good genius of
the Grange, and I am almost ready to think that, if you had never left
it, we should all be there still.

Thats right. Put all the blame upon a defenseless woman.

I am glad you were not there at the end; it was a miserable time.

He was so deeply serious that Annie grew serious too.

Do you think I would have gone if I had known what was coming? Oh,
George, you cannot think so ill of me!

It is better for you that you did go then; you could not have
prevented the crash. I had known it must come from the time my father
died. It has been nothing but wave after wave of difficulty, and
getting through or over them somehow ever since. I suppose it would
have been better to give up long ago; but we were so hedged in on every
side that the ruin was bound to be complete when it did come, and you
are just the sort of woman to understand the feeling which forces one,
with or against ones will, to fight it out to the end, and stave off
the fall into a broken-down swell as long as possible.

George, George, how can you use such an absurd term? You, with your
pluck, your patience!

Ive used them all up, Annie, in the one tussle.

Then you must let them grow again, and go in for another tussle. You
are young, and have courage and energy. If I were you, I would never
rest until I had bought back the Grange.

I dont believe you would! said George, admiringly, as he watched the
proud flashing of her eyes and the varying expression of her face. But
I am not like that. I could fight on doggedly for something which was
being dragged away from me; but I havent it in me to begin a battle on
my own account.

Then what do you mean to do?

I shall get some appointment where I can grow gray with
respectability; my people can manage that, and they will. It is a
scandal for a baronet to starve, you know. Why, you silly child, you
are crying! Thank Heaven, Annie! I didnt think you were so fond of me.
