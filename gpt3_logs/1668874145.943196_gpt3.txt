SCENE:
VII


FATE FLINGS OPEN A CLOSED DOOR

ROWAN McCOY drove his new carit was a flivver, though they did not
call it that in those dayswith the meticulous care of one who still
distrusts the intentions of the brute and his own skill at circumventing
them.

As he skidded to a halt in front of the store with brakes set hard a
woman came out to the porch and nodded to him. She waited until the
noise of the engine had died before she spoke:

Going down to Wagon Wheel, Mac?

If I can stay with this gasoline bronc that far. Anything I can do for
you, Mrs. Stovall?

The woman hesitated, her thin lips pressed tight in an habitual
expression of dry irony. She moved closer.

That houn Joe Tait has been a-beatin up Norma again. She phoned up
she wanted to get down to the train. Ive a fool notion shes quittin
him for good.

The cattleman waited in silence. It was not a habit of his to waste
words.

Wanted I should find someone to take her and her traps to Wagon Wheel.
But seems like everybodys right busy all of a sudden. A light sarcasm
filtered through the thin, cool voice of the postmistress. Folks just
hate to be onneighbourly, but their team has done gone lame or the
wifes sick or the wagon broke a wheel. O course it aint that any of
thems afraid to mad that crazy gunman, Tait. Nothin like that.

McCoy looked across at the blue-ribbed mountains. Mrs. Stovall noticed
that the muscles stood out like ropes on the brown cheeks of his
close-gripped jaw. She did not need to ask the reason. Everybody in the
Hill Creek country knew the story of Norma Davis and Rowan.

Im not asking you to take her, Mac, the woman ran on sharply. You
got more right to have a flat tire than Pete Henderson has to have

Where is she? interrupted the man.

Youll find her the yon side of the creek.

Mrs. Stovall knew when she had said enough. Silently she watched him
crank the car and drive away. As he disappeared at the rim of the park a
faint, grim smile of triumph touched her sunken mouth.

I most knew hed take her, she said aloud to herself. Course
therell be a rookus between him and Joe Tait, but I reckon thats his
business.

At intervals during the morning that sardonic smile lit the wrinkled
face. It was an odd swing of the pendulum, she thought, that had
reversed the situation. Years ago Norma had run away from her lover with
good-for-nothing Joe Tait. Now she was escaping from Tait with McCoy by
her side. How far would fate carry the ironic jest? Mrs. Stovall was no
Puritan. If Norma could unravel some scattered threads of happiness from
the tangled skein of her wretched life, Martha Stovall cared little
whether she kept within the code or not. No woman was ever more entitled
to a divorce than the abused wife of the sheepman.

A woman came out from the cottonwoods beyond the ford to meet McCoy. She
was dressed in a cheap gown hopelessly out of date, and she carried a
telescope valise with two broken straps.

If any of the bitterness McCoy had felt toward her when his wound was
fresh survived the years it must have died now. Life had dealt harshly
with her. There had been a time when she was the belle of all this ranch
country, when she had bloomed with health and spirits, had been as full
of fire as an unbroken bronco. Now her step dragged. The spark of
frolicsome deviltry had long been quenched from her eye. Her pride had
been dragged in the dust, her courage brutally derided. Even the good
looks with which she had queened it were marred. She was on the way to
become that unattractive creature, the household drudge. Yet on her
latest birthday she had reached only the age of twenty-six.

At recognition of the man in the car she gave a startled little cry:

YouRowan!

It was the first time they had been alone together in seven years, the
first time she had directly addressed him since the hour of their
quarrel. At the unexpectedness of the meeting emotion welled up in her
throat and registered there like the quicksilver in a thermometer.
