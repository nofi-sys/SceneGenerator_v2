SCENE:
I dont think we have time for either, replied Philip Walcheren. I
have only about ten minutes to spare, and the Father honours me with
his company at dinner to-night, so I think Marion will be disappointed
if I deprive her of her five-oclock tea gossip with him. She is,
doubtless, anxiously awaiting us now. But I felt I could not pass
another night without asking you, Frederick, if a rumour which I have
heard concerning you is true.

Whats up now? demanded his cousin.

I met young Fellows in the city this afternoon, Mrs Bouchers brother,
you know, and he told me that it is commonly said in Hampstead that you
are engaged, or about to be engaged, to Miss Crampton.

What of it? said Frederick carelessly.

Surely it is not true! Surely, with your antecedents, Frederick, you
are not thinking of marrying any respectable woman!

Would you prefer my marrying a disreputable one, then, Philip?

Most certainly not! What I mean is, that, under the circumstances, you
have no right to marry at all. How can you go up to Gods holy altar
with any woman, whilst that unfortunate girl down at Luton is even now
expiating the awful sin you led her into?

Of course, it is quite impossible that it was she who led me instead
of the other way? said Frederick, interrogatively.

Whosoever fault it may have been in the first instance, you know that
you are responsible now.

And I am quite ready to meet my responsibilities. Do you want me to
marry the straw-plaiter down at Luton?

No, no! I want you to do nothing but alter your mode of living,
Frederick, and try and be a decent member of society. It is terrible
to think how you go on, without care for yourself or others, without
a thought of God, or the future that lies before you. If poor Sir
Frederick Ascher had only foreseen the uses his money would have been
put to, he would have thought twice before he left it to you.

Yes! but, luckily for me, he didnt foresee, so I can do as I like
about it. Has Father Tasker a lecture in store for me as well?
inquired Frederick, turning to the priest.

No! my son, we are not in the confessional, where I could wish we
met oftener; but I would like to remind you that, although your late
godfather made no actual conditions regarding the expenditure of
the fortune he left you, yet his wishes, that it should be devoted
to the church, were so strongly expressed, as almost to amount to a
demand, and I cannot believe that any blessing will follow a different
disposition of it.

I have confessed to no intention of marrying, remember, but should I
ever do so, my wife will be my church, and I shall settle my money upon
her.

But this was a blasphemy that neither Philip Walcheren nor the priest
could pass over in silence.

Be careful, my son, be careful, cried the one, lest the curse of
Heaven, and the church you despise, are both provoked against you.

I cannot believe, Frederick, that you seriously mean what you say,
exclaimed his cousin. The money is only yours for your lifetime,
and, if you do not dedicate it to the holy church at your death,
some fearful calamity will surely overtake you, or those to whom you
wrongfully give it.

Nonsense! replied Frederick; I suppose you both mean well, but I
would rather you understood me at once. As matters stand at present,
I have not the slightest intention of leaving my money to the church.
My godfather--peace to his ashes!--left it to me, and I recognise
but one authority in the matter, and that is the law, which is on my
side. I wonder, by the way, Philip, that you stick up so badly for the
stability of the profession by which you live!

Every consideration must give way to the claims of the church,
Frederick!

Well, I dont agree with you. I think Mother Church has feathered her
own nest pretty well, considering her claims to humility and poverty.
In my idea, my own nest will have the prior claim on my indulgence!

So you are really contemplating matrimony, Frederick, said Philip. I
wonder you can dare to enter a church under the circumstances, lest the
walls and roof should fall in upon you.

Perhaps I shall be married in a registrars office, responded
Frederick lightly; but the jest was so ill-timed that neither of his
hearers commented upon it.
