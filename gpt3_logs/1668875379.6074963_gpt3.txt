Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Im not fond of you--Im disgusted with you! said Annie, fiercely,
stiffening herself rigidly as he leaned toward her. Why, do you know
that even Harry shows more spirit than that?

What makes you say even Harry? asked Sir George, quietly. I could
have told you long ago that Harry had pluck and spirit enough for six,
in spite of his impossible manners and boorish conversation. If anybody
buys back the Grange, it will be he.

Annie listened with her cheeks tingling.

When did you first begin to think all that of him? she asked, in a
low voice.

I knew, when we were lads together, that there was something in him;
but I own I lost sight of the fact while he led his loose, lazy life at
the Grange after you had left him. But, when you left the Grange this
last time--more than two months ago--he let me see his best side again
one night when we were talking about you.

About me? whispered Annie, breathlessly.

Yes; he told me he loved you with all his soul, and he meant to win
you back to him if he had to wait ten years. And I believe him.

George, said she, in a low, uncertain voice, raising her eyes to his,
after a pause, he has done it already. But--but he wont give me a
chance of telling him so. He wont let me know where he is, and--and
indeed he doesnt care for me as much as you think; for, if he did, he
couldnt make appointments with--with other women, sobbed she, with
her head in her hands.

Are you sure that he does, Annie? asked her brother-in-law, earnestly.

Quite sure. I--I overheard it, quavered she.

Dont be so certain about it yet, my poor child! If ever a man was
in solemn earnest, Harry was when he spoke to me about you, and he is
far too pig-headed to change like that in a few weeks. He swore to me
that you were the only woman in the world for him, and he should never
look at another again. Trust me, dont make up your mind that he is
faithless to you yet. His keeping away from you means something more
than that, or Im much mistaken in him.

Annie allowed herself to be somewhat comforted by these words, and she
promised George, who of course managed to allow himself as many--if not
more--of the small comforts of life as he had done before his ruin, to
accompany him to Ascot in ten days time, to play good angel to him and
raise his spirits.

But in the meantime she had another visit from Stephen, who looked more
haggard than ever; and, as he hinted to her that Harry was again in
want of money, and as some dressmaking expenses had used up all she had
in hand until she received her next weekly salary, she fastened up a
bracelet, her best pair of ear-rings, and a diamond brooch which George
had given her into a little packet, which she put into Stephens hands,
saying:

I have been spending a lot of money upon myself this week, so I cant
spare any just now. There are a few trinkets here which I never wear,
and I can spare them better than money. Would you mind selling them
for me and giving the money to Harry?

Your jewelry! No, I cant take that! said Stephen, thrusting the
packet hastily back and opening the door.

Nonsense! You must--I insist! There is not a thing I care for among
them, said Annie; and with gentle force she made him take them,
pitying the poor fellow as she did so for his reluctance to let her
part with her trinkets.

A few days after that was Cup-day at Ascot; and George, true to his
promise, came in a hansom to take her to the station; for they were
going down by train. It was a most beautiful day, Annie enjoyed herself
with an unclouded delight which infected her companion, and it took
all his loyalty and a little of her tact to prevent his making love
to her again. She was too wise to suggest economy to him when he took
her, as a matter of course, on to the grand stand and spent his money
with rather more recklessness than in the old days, when he had a large
establishment to keep up, and clamorous young brothers allowances
to pay. Men in difficulties always had plenty of ready money, she
knew, and were much lighter-hearted companions than men who went on
ploddingly paying their debts as they arose.

George left her for a few minutes, sitting, her face all smiles and
sunshine, with his race-glass in her hand, examining the carriages
which lined the course. He had gone into the ring, and had promised
to be back in time for the next race. He returned to find her leaning
back, white and shivering, with the luster gone from her eyes, and her
arms hanging limply at her sides. A lady--a stranger--was supporting
her head.
