SCENE:
For years Falkner had fought his snarling way against those who held the
upper hand. Hatred and bitterness had filled his soul. But the contact
with this soft, helpless bit of gurgling humanity sent a queer thrill
through him. It was as if pink velvet of exquisite texture, breathing
delicious life, were rubbing itself against his cheek. But it was not
alone the physical sensation that reached him. Somehow the little
beggar, so absolutely sure of his welcome, twined those dimpled fingers
around the heartstrings of the callous man. Not since his mothers death
had any human being come to him with such implicit trust. The Adams
apple in the convicts throat shot up and registered emotion.

The blamed little cuss! See him grab a-holt of my ear.

Ruth left the baby in his arms, took off her coat, and walked to the
stove. She held out her hands and began to warm them.

We were in the car, she explained. I took the high-line back because
I was afraid of the upper bridge. The machine stalled in a drift.

You dont ask me how-come Im here, he growled.

I know, she said simply. Art Philips dropped in to Yerbys and stayed
for dinner. He told us you escaped four days ago.

Did he tell you I killed a guard?

No. He said you wounded one.

First I knew he wasnt dead. Wish Id been more thorough. If ever a man
needed killing, he did.

They abused you a good deal, didnt they? she ventured.

He ripped out a sudden furious oath. If ever I get a chance at two or
three of them

Better not think of that now. The question is how you are going to get
away.

Whats that to you? he demanded, his suspicions all alert.

I thought if youd come down to the Circle Diamond you could get a
horse. That would give you a much better chance.

And how do I know you wouldnt phone to Matson? he sneered.

She looked at him. Dont you know me better than that, Mr. Falkner?
she said gently.

He mumbled what might be taken either for an apology or for an oath.

Thats all right. I dare say I wouldnt be very trustful myself if I
had been through what you have. Ruth tossed him a smiling nod and
dismissed the subject. But were not down at the ranch yet. How long is
this storm likely to last, Mr. Falkner?

It will blow itself out before morning. Too early in the season for it
to last. I reckon its only a one-day blizzard.

You dont think there will be any trouble about getting down to-morrow,
do you? she asked anxiously. Im not worried about myself, but Ive
got to get food for Baby.

Depends on the snow, he said sulkily. If it keeps on, you cant break
trail and carry the kid.

Perhaps you could go with me; then you could cut out a horse and ride
away after dark.

I dont have to go down there. I can pick up a horse at Yerbys. He
added grudgingly in explanation: Me for the hills. I dont want to get
down into the valleys, where too many people are.

At midnight the storm outside was still howling and the sleety snow was
beating against the window. The wind, coming straight from the divide
above, buffeted the snow clouds in front of it. Drifts sifted and
shifted as the snow whirled with the changing gusts.

The young mother, crouched behind the stove with her baby asleep across
her knees, drowsed at times and wakened again with a start to see
half-shuttered eyes shining across at her from the other side of the
fire. In the darkness of the night she was afraid. Those gleaming points
of light, always focused on her, were too suggestive of a beast of prey.
With that blizzard raging outside she was a thousand miles from help,
beyond the chance of human aid in case of need.

Again her instinct served Ruth well. She rose stiffly and carried the
baby across to the man.

Would you mind holding him for a while? Ive been still so long my
muscles are stiff and numb.
