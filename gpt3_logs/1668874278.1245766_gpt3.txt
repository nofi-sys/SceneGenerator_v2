Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
It cost him his life, poor devil! Rogers broke out.

I aint so sure it wont cost us ours, added Yerby quietly. If Id
known Gilroy was here to-night, Sam Yerby wouldnt have gone raiding.

Thats right, agreed Cole. Tait is one proposition; Gilroy is
another. This whole country is going to buzz now. He has hundreds of
friends.

All of them recognized the truth of this. The death of Tait alone would
have stirred no resentment. But Gilroy was an old-timer, a quiet,
well-respected man who had many friends. He had been sheriff of the
county some years before, and at the last election had been chosen
county commissioner.

Who killed him? asked Rogers again. Who started this shooting? Thats
what I want to know.

Rowan answered quietly: The less we know about that the better, boys.
Were all tied up together in this. In the excitement some of us have
gone too far. That cant be helped now. Weve got to see it out
togethergot to stand back of each other. Before the law were all
guilty. The only thing to do is to let to-nights work be a mystery that
is never solved. Well fix up a story and all stand by it.

Yerby broke a long silence. Well, boys, we better make our get-away. A
whole passell of sheriffs will be combing these hills for us soon.
Posses will be pouring in like buzzards to a water hole in the desert. I
reckon we had better fix up our alibis and then burn the wind for home.

Cant start pushing on our reins any too quick to suit me, Cole
assented.

Thats the only thing to do, agreed McCoy. Sam, you and Brad had
better get back to your homes, where youve been sleeping all night if
any one asks you. Falkner, you go back with us to the ranch. Well fix
up a story about how you joined us there and bunked with Jack and
Larry.

What about these? Rogers indicated with his hand the sprawling bodies
of the sheepmen. His voice was a whisper.

We cant do anything for them, answered Rowan. Weve got to think of
ourselves. If we talk, if we make any mistakes, were going to pay the
price of what weve done. We cant explain we didnt intend to kill any
one. Were all in this. The only thing to do is to stand together and
keep our mouths shut.

Everybody was in a sudden hurry to be gone. They tramped back to the
pine grove, and hurriedly mounted, eager to put as many miles as
possible between them and what was lying at the foot of Bald Knob.

A light snow was already falling. They welcomed it for the protection it
offered.

Weve bumped into good luck to start with, said Larry to Cole. The
snow will blot out our tracks. They cant trail us now.

Cole nodded. Yep. Thats so.

But the thing that had been done chilled their spirits, and the dread as
to what was to come of it rested like a weight upon their hearts. Mile
after mile they rode, swiftly and silently. More than once Larry glanced
over his shoulder with a shudder. He could see the snow sifting into the
sightless eyes that stared up at the breaking dawn. Always he had
laughed at the superstitions which rode ignorant people, but now he was
careful not to bring up the rear of the little procession.

Once an elk crashed out of some brush fifty feet from them. The sudden
clamour shook their nerves with dread.

Falkner laughed, but there was only bravado in his voice. I could a
brought that elk down if it hadnt been the closed season, he said.

The man riding next him did not speak aloud the thought that flashed
through his mindthat it had been an open season on sheepmen an hour
before.

The party broke up at the Three Pines after a hurried agreement as to
plans. They were all to meet at the round-up. None of them was to know
anything about the raid until news of it came to the camp from outside.

Yerby and Rogers rode into the hills, the rest down to the Circle
Diamond.

They covered the ground fast, so as to get into the house before any one
was astir with the coming day. Already gray was sifting into the sky, a
warning that the night was ending.

Larry, riding beside McCoy, looked furtively at him and asked a question
just as they came in sight of the ranch.
