SCENE:
It was on the bus, homeward bound, that Wayne first noticed it. There
seemed to be an unusual degree of sleepiness among the people about
him. In fact, everyone on the bus looked almost as if they were
drugged, so soundly were they slumbering. The driver yawned frequently,
and shook his head, presumably to help him stay awake.

Suddenly Wayne remembered Dr. Felder's trouble with his guinea pigs.
They, too, had difficulty staying awake. Could there be any connection
between them and the unseemly drowsiness of these people seated about
him? He remembered now that the Felders, too, had seemed tired. And
that when Marcia had gone for more coffee, she had joked about the fact
that the cook had been sound asleep in the kitchen.

Back in his own quarters, Wayne was restless, unreasonably disturbed.
His short-wave set was almost completely dismantled in the process
of trying a new idea of his in combined radio-audio frequency
amplification. It would take all night to get it working again, he
thought, and somehow he couldn't get himself started at the task this
evening.

Abruptly he grabbed his hat and went out into the almost deserted
Chicago streets. On Michigan Boulevard he caught a cruising taxicab
with a sleepy driver.

"Where's the best night spot?" Wayne asked impatiently.

The driver pondered, rubbed his eyes tiredly.

"Most of 'em are closing early tonight, mister. Not many customers,
for some reason. Air's muggy or something and people all seem to wanna
go home. The 601 Club's still open though. Or was half hour ago." His
mouth gaped into an enormous yawn. "Take ya there?"

His mind seething with possibilities, Wayne climbed into the cab. Could
it be that--

The 601 Club was dark.

"'Sfunny," drawled the taxi driver sleepily. "Never knew this joint
to close before six in the mornin'. And it's only two. What-ta night.
Heck, wish I could knock off early myself. Back home, mister?"

Wayne shook his head slowly, and his face became grimly resolute.

"If you can stay awake, pal, take me to the office of the Chicago
_Blade_."

Ten minutes later he dropped his hat on a corner of the night editor's
desk.

"Your gang sleepy tonight?" Wayne asked sharply, an undertone of
excitement in his voice.

The editor looked at him incuriously and nodded.

"Me too. So what? We get out a paper anyway. What you want?"

Wayne gripped the edge of the desk and leaned forward, his body tense.

"Listen, this is important. _Everybody_--in Chicago at least--is
abnormally sleepy tonight. Every night club in town is closed for lack
of customers. Even the regulars went home to bed. And you should see
the people who have to be out whether they want to or not."

The man's eyes opened wider.

"You sure? Say, that would mean--"

"The comet," snapped Wayne tersely. "The astrophysicists said it
wouldn't have any effect, but they could have been wrong. We're in the
fringe, and--"

The editor, with a visible effort, straightened up.

"Mister, if this is an exclusive, you'll get paid for the tip-off. What
a story!"

Wayne smiled grimly.

"And what bank would I cash the check at, with all the tellers asleep?
This is serious, I tell you! It might mean the end of the human race!
If those gasses of the comet's tail--"

The editor grabbed a phone with unsteady hands.

"Hey, George," he barked into the mouthpiece, "put the whole staff
on this. Have them call New York, Frisco, Los Angeles. Have them ask
whether...."

A tired-looking reporter shuffled in, and leaned against the desk.
