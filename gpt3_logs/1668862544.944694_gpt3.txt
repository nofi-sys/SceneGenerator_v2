SCENE:
VII


VICKY TELLS SECRETS

After what had just taken place at the Crystal Palace the bright
sunshine of Nevada was welcome to both brothers. Inside the gambling
house had been unwholesome excitement, passion, the dregs of cruel
murder lust, and the shadow of death. In the open street were friendly
faces, a sane world going about its business, and Gods sun in the
heavens. The McClintocks had probably snuffed out a life. It had been
one horribly distorted by evil. None the less, it shook their composure
to have sent even such a soul to its last account. They wanted, if
possible, to forget completely the look on the face of that huge figure
collapsing upon the table.

A little girl stood squarely in front of them on the broken sidewalk. To
the casual eye she appeared all patches, flying hair, and knobby legs.
There was the shy wildness of a captured forest creature in her manner,
but in her small body the McClintocks sensed, too, a dauntless spirit.

Mister Goodmans, she said, addressing them both, dont you member
me?

Of course. Youre Vicky, Scot told her.

She came directly to business. Rob, hes most always drunk n we aint
got nothin to eat. Mollie n mes jist awful hungry.

Hungry? Good Lord! cried Hugh.

His brother took charge of the situation. Go in to Grotons with Vicky
and get her a good dinner. Ill see what supplies I can pick up and go
down to the wagon with them.

In front of the Delta saloon Scot met a Washoe Indian. He was carrying a
half a sack of wild onions he had brought to town to trade. McClintock
did business with him on the spot. At Lyman Joness store the faro
dealer bought some rice and coffee. He also induced the merchant to let
him have the last five pounds of flour he had in stock. With these
supplies he tramped to the edge of town to the place where the Dodsons
had moved their camp.

He ploughed through heavy sand, up a steep slope of shale and loose
rubble, to a narrow flat where the prairie schooner stood. Mollie Dodson
must have heard him coming, for as he reached the wagon she called from
within:

Did you find Rob, Vicky?

Perhaps the firmness of his tread told her at once of her mistake. She
leaned out of the open flap and caught sight of Scot. Into her white
face the colour beat in waves. Startled eyes held to his with a
surprised question in them.

II was looking for Vicky, she said.

Yes. I met Vicky. His white teeth flashed in a smile that sought to
win her confidence. That young lady has a lot of sense. She wanted to
know why the trustees of the Virginia Dodson Fund were not attending to
business. So Im here.

Oh! Vicky oughtnt to have done that. Another surge of colour, born of
shame, swept into the cheeks.

For the first time Scot realized how very pretty she was. He found her
diffidence charming, for he lived in a world where the women he knew
could not afford to be shy.

Vicky did just right, he protested while he was opening his sack. Our
baby must be well fed. Its my business to see to that, and Im going to
do it from now.

He built a fire while she watched him, the baby in her arms. Mollie was
acutely uncomfortable. The gambler had taken off his coat in order that
his movements might be freer. In his figured waistcoat, frilled cambric
shirt, close-fitting trousers, and varnished boots he looked too
exquisite for menial labour. She was acutely conscious of her patched
and faded gingham. It was Cophetua and the beggar maid brought down to
date, except that she was a wife and not a girl.

I wishyou wouldnt, she stammered.

He stood up, masterful and dominant. His glance swept round and found a
battered water bucket. Wheres the spring, Mrs. Dodson? he asked.

Let me go, she begged. Itsits quite a way.

Im feeling better to-day. Maybe I can make it to the spring and back,
he said, smiling. Which way, please?
