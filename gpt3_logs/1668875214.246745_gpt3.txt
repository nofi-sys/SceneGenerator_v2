SCENE:
And the wayward woman, who, with all her faults, had generous impulses,
laid her beautiful head on the bed and sobbed.

She insisted on sharing Annies duties as nurse; and, when Harry,
after being long in danger for his life, at last flickered back toward
convalescence, the first person he recognized at his bedside was his
sister. Her passionate nature, which in many respects resembled his,
had been deeply moved by what he had done for her, and still more
by the unexpectedly quiet and dignified way in which he had done it.
She had had time to see the depth of the social abyss into which her
proposed flight would have plunged her. Her long-standing preference
for Herbert Richardson she had not subdued--she felt that she could not
subdue it; but she had broken off even her correspondence with him at
Harrys request.

Brother and sister drew near to each other, with far deeper mutual
affection than they had ever felt before, during Harrys slow return to
health. They felt that they had much in common, both ardent, passionate
natures being tied to colder ones, who could not or would not respond
to their warmth with the entire abandonment they craved. There the
likeness in their positions ended, however, for Lilian had never even
tried to sound the depths in the heart of her middle-aged husband,
while every look, every touch that Harry bestowed on his wife told
wistfully of the longing he had felt to be master of her love as he was
already of her duty.

The gentleness and even the tenderness of her care of him now would
have satisfied any one less exacting. But fondness had made the young
fellow clear-sighted; and he knew, or thought he knew, that her heart
could give more than that, if he could only reach it.

Annie herself, who seemed in this matter to have exchanged wits with
her husband, growing duller of perception as he grew brighter, fancied
that his fondness for his sister had grown stronger than his fondness
for her, and, after a moments pique, she felt glad of it, as it
rendered an avowal she had to make all the easier.

It was on the first day after he had again joined the family circle
that she found an opportunity of speaking to him alone, and of telling
him, under a promise of secrecy, that George had told her he was in
serious difficulties, and feared that he would not be able to keep up
the establishment at the Grange much longer. Harry listened rather
indifferently. He had been so accustomed to hear of these difficulties,
not only since his brother had been the head of the family, but also
in his fathers lifetime, that, as it had never been his business
to find a way out of them, they had altogether ceased to excite any
emotion in him, beyond a faint wonder why people could not keep these
matters to themselves, without worrying other people about them, and an
injured feeling that the head of the family would want to cut down his
allowance.

George is always in difficulties, said he.

Ah, but it is serious this time! We really must think about it.

Well, what does he want us to do? Sell matches or enlist? There is
nothing else for any of us.

Yes, there is, for one, said Annie, cautiously, watching him. Look
here, Harry: Ive had an engagement offered me which will bring me in
so much money that, if I save, we might live upon it before long.

Whos we?

You and I, of course.

And do you think I would live upon your money?

I think you would be very unreasonable not to do so, if I could make
enough to keep us. I dont believe George will have enough for us all
much longer, and then----

Then it is I who should work, not you.

I think it is the one who has been used to it who should work, and
that, you know, is I, she said, smiling.

But Harry did not smile back. He moved restlessly on his sofa.

It is not like you to taunt me, Annie; yet--yet your words sting
somehow, he said at last.

Oh, Harry, you know I did not mean that! Dont you see, Harry, dear,
you have been very ill, and wont be strong for a long time after this
second attack; while I have done nothing but enjoy myself for more than
three months.

Yes, you have. You have been nursing me, said he, tenderly.

Ah, but that wasnt work; that was pleasure, except when--when you
were so very ill this last time! rejoined she gently. And now I have
had an offer to play a part in London which would just suit me, and
might make me a name, and to have six guineas a week for it. And, if I
dont take it, I may never have such a chance again! she added, with
ill-concealed eagerness.
