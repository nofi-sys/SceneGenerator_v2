SCENE:
Mrs. Budd met them at the front door and hustled Hugh quickly into the
house. Ive just had a message from Jim. Theres a warrant out for your
arrest. Its for killin Sam Dutch, I expect. Who ever heard the like?
But Jims got to serve it, he says. So Im to hide you in the attic.
When he comes hell look for you and wont find you.

Whats the use? If theyve got a warrant out for me theyll get me
sooner or later. The verdict of the coroners jury was that Dutch came
to his death at the hands of God. Its some trick. They cant make it
stick.

Thats what Jim says. Its a trick. Irish Tom told him there is
something in the air. He doesnt know just what. But the Dodsons are
back of it. So Jim says for you to lie low and see what happens.

All right, Mrs. Budd. Well let Jim run this, Hugh said. Im in the
hands of my friends, like the willin candidates for office say they
are.

Supperll be ready in a little. Ill have Bennie watch the road so as
to give you time to get upstairs if any one comes. I expect youre
hungry.

Im always hungry when Mrs. Budd gives me an invitation to eat, he
answered, smiling. Shes the best cook in Nevada, and a two-bit
restaurant doesnt draw me a-tall on those glad occasions.

It was on the tip of Mrs. Budds sharp tongue to say that the company at
her table might have something to do with that, but since she was
manuvring to bring about a certain match between two young people
present she refrained from comment.

Hugh did very well on steak, roast wild duck, potatoes, home-made bread,
honey, and dried-apple pie. It is probable that he did not enjoy himself
less because a young woman sat opposite him whose dark eyes flashed soft
lights of happiness at him and whose voice played like sweet music on
his heart.

Mrs. Budd was urging on him another piece of pie when Bennie ran in with
news.

Dads comin down the road with two other men, he shouted in a lifted
key of youthful excitement.

Hugh retired to the garret.

Sheriff Budd came wheezing into the house followed by his deputies.
Seen anything of Hugh McClintock? he asked his wife.

Where would I see him? I havent been out of the house, his plump
helpmate answered tartly.

Well, I got to search the house. Some folks seem to think hes here.

Whats he done? asked Vicky.

Why, he kidnapped that good kind citizen Sam Dutch, a man who hadnt
murdered but fourteen or fifteen people, and who never packed moren two
guns an a pig-sticker at one time, the sheriff said dryly. Such
lawlessness sure ought to be punished severe. Id say send this
McClintock fellow to Congress or somethin like that. Make a sure enough
example of him.

Jim waddled into the dining room. His eye fell on the devastation of the
supper table. If he noticed the extra plate at the table he made no
comment upon it. Neither did the deputies. The sheriff had hand-picked
them carefully. Little Bennie followed, wriggling with excitement. Up to
date this was the big adventure of his young life.

Jims eyes asked a question of his wife and received an answer. He
learned from the wireless that had passed between them that his
instructions had been carried out.

Look through the kitchen and the hen house, boys, the sheriff gave
orders. Then well move upstairs. I dont reckon he could be here
without Mrs. Budd knowin it. But the way to make sure is to look.

They presently trooped upstairs. While the deputies were searching the
bedrooms Budd puffed up to the garret. In order to establish his
identity he sang a solo:

Old dog Tray ever faithful
Grief cannot drive him away.
Hes gentle and hes kind,
And youll never, never

The sheriff opened the door of the attic and stepped in. Hugh was
straddling a chair with his elbows across the back of it. He grinned at
his friend.
