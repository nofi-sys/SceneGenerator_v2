SCENE:
Good idea, too, he hastened to observe. Weve never had a chance
before to see what one of these sandy Keys is like. And from the looks
of things, now were close in, it wouldnt be such a tough job to break
through that scrub. Most of the thick growth, it seems, is in the
mangrove thickets along the shores.

Will you come along with us, Jack? asked Oscar.

Please excuse me, boys, the other replied. This camera weighs a
whole lot, as you both know, and its a pretty hot day in the bargain.
I wouldnt like to leave it behind, because we only fetched the one
with us this time, and if anything happened to injure it my cake would
be all dough.

Perhaps youre sensible, after all, Jack, laughed Oscar. We may be
sorry we started before we get through with the job.

If we find the going hard through the island, said Ballyhoo shrewdly,
why, we could come back along the beach, mebbe. But shucks! there
isnt going to be any difficulty at all. Still, Im curious to know
what that smoke I saw meant.

At hearing him say that Jack spoke up.

Im glad you thought it worth while to fetch your rifle along with
you, Oscar, because if anything should happen, and you did run across
some hard characters, theyd find you armed.

Oh! give Ballyhoo credit for thinking about the gun, replied Oscar;
but if we mean to get back before sunset, Ballyhoo, wed better be
starting.

They left Jack sitting there near the boat, and fiddling with
his camera, as Ballyhoo always called it when the artist chose to
manipulate certain screws, or make any sort of changes to suit his whim.

Why, this isnt half bad, after all, Oscar! the Jones boy declared
after they had been moving along for some little time, keeping their
faces in the one set direction, which was easily done, since they had
the sun to guide them.

A regular picnic, I should call it, the leader said over his shoulder.

Some time afterwards Oscar reached the conclusion that they must be
drawing near the opposite side of the Key, having gone directly across
it from end to end. The breeze was rustling the serrated leaves of the
palmettoes, and waving the long fronds of the cocoanut trees, showing
that there was quite a little air stirring at this end of the island,
even while it seemed calm where they were working.

Suddenly Oscar stopped dead in his tracks.

Did you hear anything then, Ballyhoo? he asked.

I certainly did, came the reply, and it sounded mighty like an oar
hitting the side of a boat, in the bargain.

Just what I thought, continued the other. Come, lets creep forward
and take a look out. I expect we must be close to the beach that Ive
figured lies at this end of the Key, protected by a reef or two further
off.

Accordingly, they continued to advance, their eyes constantly on the
lookout for any sign of life beyond. Then they began to catch glimpses
of the water, showing that at this end of the Key the thick mangroves
did not grow at all.

I can see green cocoanuts up there, hanging in clusters on those
trees, whispered the observant Ballyhoo; for it had been one of his
most ardent hopes that while on this expedition to the semi-tropics
he might have the pleasure of knocking down a green cocoanut himself,
and trying to see what the mushy contents tasted like; for all his
experience hitherto had been with the ripened nuts of commerce, with
their milk, and hard rim of meat.

Never mind that just now, warned Oscar, in a whisper, for weve got
other fish to fry. There, I heard that sound again, only further away.
And when that rustle among the leaves quiets down it strikes me I catch
the splash of oars.

Theres something doing, as sure as eggs are eggs, muttered Ballyhoo,
even as the pair of them crept further on, and by degrees began to
get a clearer view of the pretty sandy beach, as well as the open sea
beyond.

I see the boat! snapped Ballyhoo suddenly.

Not so loud, please, warned his companion; and dont move again if
you can help it. The men who are rowing have their faces turned this
way, and might discover us.
