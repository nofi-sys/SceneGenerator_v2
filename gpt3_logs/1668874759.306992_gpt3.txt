SCENE:
VI.


When Harry uttered the words My wife! his brother looked from one
to the other for a few moments without a word; then, in a low, sullen
voice, he said:

You have tricked me and deceived me, both of you. It was very
clever--very clever indeed, but hardly wise. I wont take up your time
any longer now. Then, turning to Annie, he continued, I am much
obliged to you for your kind welcome. I must apologize for having
brought down your husbands anger upon you; but, you see, you left me
rather in the dark. Then to Harry--You will hear from me in a day
or two. Our father made me promise to provide for you, and I have a
proposal to make which I dont think you will find ungenerous. Send me
an answer as quickly as you can.

He shook his brothers hand and then Annies and left the room. Harry
turned to his wife, looking rather anxious.

He is going to do something nasty, Annie--I am sure of it. I know
Georges manner when he is spiteful, and our chances look very bad,
darling. No more Paris, no more pretty gowns, for the present, at any
rate!

But Annie did not answer. With trembling fingers she was pulling to
pieces the flower which had fallen from her throat.

Why, Annie, what is the matter? You look ill--you are crying!

I am not ill, said she, repulsing him. I am heart-sick, miserable.

But you mustnt give way like that, my darling. George will have to
come round. He shant make my wife spoil her pretty eyes.

It is not George, she said, with fire. Do you think I am such a
coward as to mind not having pretty dresses? What was that he said
about forgery?

Oh, nothing to make such a fuss about! answered the young fellow
sulkily. I was hard up, I had no money for our wedding trip, and I
couldnt help it. It wasnt as if I committed a crime, and copied
somebody elses name, it was my own fathers. I knew it would be
all right, and so it was. He hushed it up directly, and said hardly
anything about it.

You call that nothing! said Annie, raising her eyes wide with horror
to his face.

Of course I know it was wrong, replied he impatiently; but there was
nothing else to be done. I could not have married you without, or you
would have had to pass your honeymoon in an attic.

I would rather have passed it as a tramp on the high-road than as we
did, if I had known.

Well, you are an ungrateful little cat. When I thought of nothing but
pleasing you and buying you pretty things from morning till night.

Pretty things that were bought with stolen money!

How dare you say such thing to me? he shouted. Dont you know Im
your husband; and do you suppose I am not the best judge of my own
conduct? Do you suppose I should ever do anything a gentleman need be
ashamed of?

I think you have done a thing a beggar would be ashamed of.

Thank you, thank you! You call me a beggar and you call me a thief. I
shall be a murderer next, I suppose; and, by Jove, it would serve you
right if I were. Havent I behaved well to you? Didnt I come to London
with you just to stop you from crying? And didnt I marry you when I
knew very well that all my family would disapprove of it?

Oh, yes; you made a noble sacrifice. I am deeply grateful to you for
throwing yourself away. It spoils the look of it a little, though,
that your elder brother was willing to do so, too, if you hadnt been
beforehand with him.

You may say what you like; but it is a sacrifice of a mans liberty to
marry at twenty. As for George, I believe you like him better than me
all the time. Answer me--do you--did you ever care for him? demanded
he roughly.

I shall not answer your insulting questions, said the young wife, in
a very calm voice; and, as quickly as she could, she left the room. For
she felt as if her heart were breaking; this sharp wrangle had made
her almost hysterical, and she did not want to break down before the
husband whom, for the time at least, she despised and all but hated.
