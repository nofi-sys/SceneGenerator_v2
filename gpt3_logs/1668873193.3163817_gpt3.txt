SCENE:
VI
AN OLD-FASHIONED JOURNEY


Put on your big sun hat and dust wrap, Nathan had said, we are to
drive through a wild region much of the way and shall have plenty of
dust and sun, besides you need have little fear of meeting acquaintances
on our long path over the prairie.

And Lissa had packed in big trunks, that were to be sent ahead of them
by express, all the pretty dresses and hats which were so becoming to
her, and reserved only the most serviceable costume for that season of
the year. This she covered with an ample linen wrap, and tied a leghorn
flat over her shining curls.

They were to go in a wagon, and, contrary to the usual emigrant fashion,
an uncovered one. Nathan wanted a light spring-wagon to use upon his
farm, and Lissa insisted that she could see the country and enjoy the
ride after the fleet little mustangs better in that particular wagon
than in any other possible conveyance.

They started upon a beautiful September morning, one of those days which
seem to blend the perfection of summer loveliness with the delightful,
hazy charm of early autumn.

All you need now is a brass band and a banner, Donald said, as Nathan
drove up to the door with the scrubby little ponies attached to the
brightly painted wagon, and you could take a bridal tour in first-class
style.

And, Lissa, if you should meet any Indians by the way be sure you shake
hands with them, and say How, which is the Indian for How dyou do.
It means, you know, that you are ready for decapitation if it so pleases
them and only question their _manner_ of procedure. They might be
offended if you omitted this little ceremony, and become unpleasant;
and, Lissa, if any of them shall ask you for a lock of your hair dont
hesitate to cut off a curl and give it to them with the sweetest smile
you can muster, for they might take a notion to take the whole of them
just to hang in their belts for ornaments, andBut I dont mean to
frighten you, pon my soul I dont! he continued, noting the suspicion
of tears in Lissas bright eyes and the tremor in her voice as she
turned to bid good-by to Squire Bartram and the irrepressible,
fun-loving brother whom she had taken into her affection.

The wild home to which you are going will have one star of the first
magnitude to brighten it before many days, but I reckon it will be
rather dark in this quarter of the heavens to-night, he said, looking
graver than she had ever before seen him.

O Don, how can that be, when _you_ are to remain? Lissa replied,
smiling through her tears.

I am a planet and only shine by reflected light, he replied; not that
I shall cast any reflection upon what has gone before, he added in his
old manner. But dont be surprised if you should see a stray comet out
on the prairies before many moons-theres no telling when one may be
liable to strike you.

The sooner the better, she responded brightly, and with a few more
words of final adieu they drove away.

They had several miles of drive to the ferry which should transport them
across the Missouri River, or the Big Muddy as the Indians named its
roily waters.

It well deserves its name, observed Lissa.

Yes, responded Nathan, and this river keeps its color and current
separate unto itself for many miles after emptying into the clear
Mississippi.

I should say the Mississippi refused to be polluted by it and tried to
quarantine against it, Lissa returned.

They noted the pretty villages along the shore, which had looked so near
to them from the bluffs, before they crossed to the Nebraska side and
found themselves in the flourishing city of Omaha. There was little to
distinguish it from other cities in the East, except the regularity of
its streets and the newer style of architecture which uniformly met
their gaze. An hour later they were out upon the broad, balsam-scented
prairie.

The wind-swept grasses nodded to them invitingly and the unrebuked sun
shone down smilingly upon the unmarred handiwork of Nature.

Lissa was enraptured. This was the unfettered life of which she had
dreamed. Her buoyant spirit was exhilarated by the fresh, flower-scented
air and the glory of the landscape.

O Nathan, I shall never want to go East again! she cried as they
approached the Platte River and viewed the magnificent stretch of land
for several miles up the valley, so level, so perfect, with the shining
thread of the river like a prescient nerve carrying health and vigor to
the adjacent territory. And far at the north and south the soft gray
hills arose, joining the clear blue of the sky above as if earth,
enamoured with the beauty of heaven, had arisen to meet the skys
embrace.
