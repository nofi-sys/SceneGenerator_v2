SCENE:
XXXIX


SLEUTHING

Scot was called back to Carson on official business, so that it was Hugh
who entrained for Austin to join Browning on his search for evidence. In
the old days of the pony express the boy rider had seen Austin a score
of times. It was in the heart of a desert that stretched six hundred
miles from east to west, a desert walled in by the Rockies on one side
and the Sierras on the other. The town lay huddled between the sides of
a caon which ran sharply up from the Reese River valley. Houses were
built everywhere and anywhere, on ground so steep that one side of a
house often had a story more than the other. It was a place of dirty
sprawling shacks surrounded by dry dusty plains upon which no birds or
wild beasts could be seen. The note of the place was its raw crudeness.
For here, half a thousand miles from San Francisco, the first wave of
Pacific Coast migration had spent itself.

Yet even Austin had its social amenitiesits churches, its schools, its
first-class French restaurant, its theatre, and its daily paper. When
Samuel Bowles of Springfield, Massachusetts, passed through the town in
the middle sixties he found its barber shops as well equipped as those
of New York and its baths as luxurious as continental ones.

Over a Chateaubriand with mushrooms, following a soup that could have
been inspired only by a Gallic brain, Browning and McClintock sat at a
small table in the famous French restaurant and discussed the problem
before them. The lawyer had made small headway. He knew the date of
William Thorntons death. The man had fallen down a shaft while drunk
two weeks after the date of the contract which the Dodsons held. He had
found no evidence of any irregularity. Nobody he had met recalled a
visit made by the Dodsons to town, but in the ebb and flow of the camps
busy life they might have been here. For in the boom days hundreds of
men drifted in and out each week.

Browning had worked at the court house. Hugh mixed with people at the
post office and in saloons. A dozen times that day he turned the
conversation upon Singlefoot Bill. He picked up a good deal of
information about the habits of that eccentric character, but none of it
seemed very much to the point. The first lead he struck was at the
Mammoth Lager Beer Saloon, a big resort on the corner of Main and
Virginia.

An old-timer had been telling a story about Thornton. After he had
finished he pulled himself up and ruminated. Doggone it, that wasnt
Singlefoot, either. It was his brother Chug.

This was news to Hugh. Had he a brother?

Sure had. The old-timer chuckled. Lived in cabins side by side an
didnt speak to each other for years. I reckon the good Lord never made
two more contrary humans than Chug an Singlefoot.

Wheres Chug now?

Hes been daid two years. He referred the matter to another
tobacco-stained relic. When was it Chug died, Bill?

Bill made a stab at the date. His friend promptly and indignantly
disagreed with him. They argued the matter with acrimony, but Hugh
learned nothing definite from the quarrel.

He remembered that newspaper editors are encyclopdias of information
and departed from the saloon, even though he had read in an
advertisement that Votaries of Bacchus, Gambrinus, Venus, or Cupid can
spend an evening agreeably at the Mammoth.

The editor made Hugh free of his files. He was not sure about the dates
of the two old fellows deaths. One had died about three months before
the other, but he could not even tell which one had passed away first.

They were alike as two peas from the same pod, he explained. Both
cranky, gnarled, and tough old birds. Even their names were almost
identical. One was Willis Thornton and the other William Thornton.

Hughs eye quickened. He had an intuition that he was on the edge of an
important discovery, though he could not guess what it was. He looked
through the back files till he came to the issue of August 14th of two
years earlier. A short story on the back page was the one he wanted. The
last sentence of it sent a pulse of excitement beating through his
blood. The story read:

OBITUARY

We regret to record the death of our esteemed fellow citizen
William Thornton, due to an accident which occurred Thursday
night while on his way home after an evening spent down town. It
appears that Mr. Thornton must have strayed from the path in the
darkness of the gulch and fallen down a deserted prospect hole.
His head struck the rocks below and death was probably
instantaneous. His body was discovered there next morning by Jim
Simpkins who works a claim near by.
