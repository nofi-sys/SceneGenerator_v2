SCENE:
XXIX
DRIFTING

Now Autumns fire burns slowly along the woods,
And day by day the dead leaves fall and melt,
And night by night the monitor blast
Wails in the keyhole, telling how it passed
Oer empty fields, or upland solitudes,
Or grim wide nave; and now the power is felt
Of melancholy, tenderer in its moods
Than any joy indulgent Summer dealt.
Allingham.


The autumnal days were nearly gone, and occasionally was felt the sharp
tooth of the biting wind as it swept over the open prairie and drove the
Westerner into his cabin, with a tingling warning in his ears that
winter was soon to come. Then again the sun would shine brightly and the
soft graces and tints of Indian summer would brighten the landscape.

The weeks had brought a degree of calmness and resignation to Elinor
Wylie, and to Tibby varied experiences. For some reason, though Donald
Bartram spent most of his spare time with her, she preferred not to be
recognized as the object of his affections. Poor Esther McClearys
disappearance was too recent, and although nothing definite had been
known as to Donalds interest in her, the gossips of the neighborhood
had been pleased to couple their names together.

It was not certain that Esther was dead. She might purposely have hidden
herself from Professor Russell, and if so might return at any time, now
that the man came no more to the community.

It ill became Donald to give so much time to this fair enchantress who
deserved so little consideration from him. Of all the provoking,
undisciplined minxes, Tibby appeared the worst. Alice and Nellie
wondered daily at his forbearance, and commented on Tibbys behavior.

As for Donald himself, he was drifting with the tide of events, and the
pastime pleased him too well to care to interrupt it by very serious
thoughts or determinations. Tibby was interesting. He enjoyed her
society. That was sufficient.

To-day he had claimed Tibby for a ride to the post, and as they came
cantering slowly along the soft gray turf, Tibby with her riding-hat
tipped back from her wide, smooth forehead, her feline eyes half closed
from the suns bright rays, her dark hair partly escaped from comb and
pin, and fluttering in curled rings about her face, her red lips half
parted above the white teeth, she looked to the man a disheveled Hebe,
too adorable, too incomprehensible to withstand.

His eyes flashed with a new resolution as he rode up close by her side.

Miss Tibby, were you never serious in your life, he asked, bending
toward her.

The girl slackened her horses pace and looked over and past him
reflectively.

Yes, once, she said at last, as if she had taken time to review her
life from the beginning.

I should like to know when it was.

Well, I will tell you, though it is a very impertinent question for you
to ask, and I feel under no obligation to answer it. It was when I lived
in the country and had an attack of quinsy. I couldnt speak for three
whole days, and the village doctor diagnosed my case as diphtheria. I
expected to die, of course, and I really felt quite serious and anxious,
I must confess.

You had reason to, if you could not talk, Donald replied in a dry
tone.

So I thought. When one can neither talk nor breathe, one has time for
serious reflection. Now, please, Mr. Bartram, dont say anything about
the delight of my friends under the circumstances, for I think I have
heard something of the kind before. I wrote notes to them.

That must have been delightful.

For them or me?

Both. Miss Waring, why are you so unlike other girls?

Tibby opened her eyes to their widest extent.

You alarm me, Mr. Bartram, she said. How am I different? Ill wager
two bits that I know. Its these freckles on the side of my nose. She
turned her head toward him with a bewitching air of candor. I dont
mind them, indeed I dont. Besides, they are not there all the time,
only since I came here and rode about in the sun and wind so much.
