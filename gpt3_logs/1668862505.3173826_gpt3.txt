Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Scot climbed into the bed of an empty ore wagon and clapped his hands
for silence. Only those in his immediate vicinity heard him, wherefore
Scot got what he wanted by the simple expedient of firing his revolver
into the air.

For a moment there was the threat of a stampede, but not after the
discovery that McClintock had fired the gun. Scot was known as a
professional gambler, a respectable business man who did not kill
wantonly. It was evident that he wanted to make a speech. Anything in
reason that Scot McClintock wanted in Virginia City he could have. He
was the most popular man in camp.

Go to it, Scot. Onload heap much oration, someone shouted.

After which there was silence.

Boys, Scot began simply, Im going to tell you something that will
please you a lot. Weve got a baby in camp, a real, genuine,
blown-in-the-bottle guaranteed baby, the first one that ever hit
Virginia City. Its a lady baby, and her names Susan. Now, weve none
of us got anything against Susan. Its a good name. But its not the
name for our baby. Were going to name that kid Virginia or know why.

A wild howl of approval lifted into the air. The emotions of Washoe were
direct and primitive. This was the sort of thing that made its sure
appeal. These men were far from their womenkind and the ties of home.
Many of them had slipped into ways that would have shocked their
sheltered relatives in older communities. But they were sentimental as
schoolgirls. A baby was the symbol of all the happiness they had left
behind when they undertook the lonesome hardships of gold hunting. They
cheered and shouted and shook hands with each other in deep delight.

Were going to give this kid a good send-off, because shes our baby.
Virginia is her name and Virginia is her home. Im going to pass the
hat, boys. You, El Dorado Johnnie and Jean Poulette and Six-Fingered
Pete and Murphy Davis get your hats off and circulate among these Washoe
millionaires and bummers. Dig deep into your jeans, every last one of
you. Were going to do the right thing by this little lady the good Lord
has sent us. Whoop er up now, adjured McClintock.

From every direction men came running to this new form of entertainment.
Saloons and gambling houses emptied. The streets began to pack. Still
the jingling of coins dropping into hats could be heard. Everybody gave.
Scot appointed a committee to count the spoils and another committee to
invite the towns brass band down to the reception.

Meanwhile he whispered in Hughs ear and the boy carried a message to
the prairie schooner.

I want to see Mrs. Dodson, he told that ladys husband.

The dull, unimaginative face of the man was lit with cupidity and
suspicion. It surely was not possible that all this money was going to
be turned over to him just because he had a baby. The world couldnt
possibly be so full of fools. Yet it looked like it. He called his wife.

She came out to the tent flap with the baby in her arms. All this noise
and confusion frightened her a little, but it did not disturb the
tousled little girl by her side. It was meat and drink to her. Her eyes
snapped with excitement. She had an inkling of what was going on, and
she wriggled like a small, pleased puppy.

Hugh took off his hat. Madam, wed like to borrow for a little while
yore family. Were figurin on a sort of a parade, and we want the baby
in it. Wed like to have you an the lil girl go along to see the
babys taken care of proper.

Goody, goody! Victoria hopped from one foot to the other as a register
of approval.

The woman hesitated. Her glance fluttered timidly to the husband. I
dont know. What do you think, Rob? Then, in a low voice: I havent
anything to wear. Perhaps you could take Baby.

The boy interposed hurriedly. Thats not quite the idea, maam. The
boys are kinda hungry to see a sure enough mother and baby. It would be
a kindness to them if youd come yoreself. Well have the stage, an you
can ride beside the driver. O course we dont aim to be bossy about it,
but our hearts are real set on this. He smiled, and Hughs boyish grin
was a winsome argument. It had the touch of sweet deference women liked.
Theyre rough looking, maam, but none of these miners would hurt you
for the world. Its a celebration for the camps first baby.

Oh, lets go, Sister Mollie, urged Victoria. I wantta ride in the
pee-rade.

The woman whispered with her husband. He broke out roughly: Dont be so
damned finicky. Your dress is all right.

Well come, the young woman told the boy. In a few minutes well be
ready. And thank you for wanting us.
