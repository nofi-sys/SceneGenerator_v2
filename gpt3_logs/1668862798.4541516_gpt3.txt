SCENE:
XIX


McCLINTOCK BILLS THE TOWN

Hughs advertisement did not appear in the _Banner_ next morning. The
editor had killed it as soon as he learned that its purpose was to annoy
Dutch. He knew several safer amusements than that. Young McClintock
might enjoy flirting with death, but as the responsible head of a family
the editor was in quite a different position.

To say that Hugh was enjoying himself is to stretch the truth. But
experience had taught him that the bold course is sometimes the least
hazardous. A line from a play he had seen at Pipers Opera House not
long since flashed to his mind. Out of this nettle danger, we pluck
this flower safety. He would go through, if necessary, to a fighting
finish. The chances were that his scorn of risk would lessen it.

Accompanied by his faithful coloured bill sticker, Hugh redecorated the
town with posters.

Jim Budd came wheezing down Turkey Creek Avenue.

You billin the town for a circus, Kid? he asked, his fat paunch
shaking. And when Hugh had stepped forward to him he added a warning in
a lower voice: Dutch is waitin for you in front of Dodsons store;
least, it looks to me like hes aimin to call yore hand.

Any one with him?

Hopkins and Bob Dodson. I kinda figured they were lookout men for him.
Say, you dont have to play a lone hand. Id as lief sit in. Byers,
too.

No, Jim. My hands stronger if I play it alone. Much obliged, just the
same.

Budd conceded this as a matter of principle, but he was reluctant to do
so in practice. Well, dont you get careless, Kid. Dutch is sudden
death with a gun. Sure is.

Opposite Dodson & Dodsons Emporium was the Mammoth Saloon.

Tack one on the door, Uncle Ned, said Hugh.

McClintock spoke without looking at the bill sticker. He was watching
three men standing in front of the store opposite. One of these hastily
retreated inside. The two who remained were Dutch and Hopkins.

The killer growled a warning. Lay off on that bill stickin. It dont
go here.

Hugh stepped across the street. He moved evenly and without haste.
Well, well, if it aint Sam Dutch, chief of Virginia and Aurora, just
as big as life and as handsome. Lemme see, you were takin the
Candelabria stage last time I saw you. Smilingly the young man began to
hum, Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker. But the smile was of the lips
only. His steely eyes held those of the big ruffian fast.

A snarling sound that might have been an oath fell from the ugly lips of
the gun-fighter. His face reflected his slow thoughts. Should he strike
now? He knew that a dozen men were waiting for the sound of a shot, that
they expected him to kill McClintock on sight. Well, he would kill him
all rightsoon.

Without lifting his eyes for an instant from his enemy, Hugh gave the
old Negro the order a second time: Nail up the bill, Uncle. Mr. Dutch
is joking. You _are_ joking, arent you?

Dutch glared at Hugh furiously. He moistened his dry lips with his
tongue.

From the left boot leg McClintock drew a bowie knife. The horn handle
was marked in a peculiar way. Hugh had shown it to a dozen men, and most
of them had recognized it. One of the pleasant habits of Dutch was to
play with it threateningly before a fascinated circle of reluctant
admirers. Now the young man held it up in his left hand.

Im tryin to find an owner for this knife. Happen to know him, Mr.
Dutch? The straight, swift probe of the eyes was cold as iron, hard as
hammered brass.

It was a call for a showdown. The men watching from the store windows,
from the saloon opposite, from the blacksmith shop below, knew that a
demand had been made on Dutch for a declaration of intentions. In the
silence which followed, men suspended their breathing. The shadow of
death hung low over the two tense figures standing out in relief.

Afterwards those present spoke of the contrast between the sullen sodden
killer and the erect, soldierly athlete facing him. The guttural snarl,
the great slouching apelike figure of the one suggested a throwback to
prehistoric days. The clear expressive eyes, the unconscious grace and
nobility of carriage, the quiet confidence of manner in the other were
products of a new land flowering to manhood.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========
