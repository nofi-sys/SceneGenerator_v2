What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
You are scandalously late, Manuel, Rosa said. You deserve no lunch.

I want no lunch, he said, but coffee and some bread. I am late,
because I have been tracking a crime. Estifanio Artigas was murdered in
this city last night.

Then it was murder?

We were talking of him a moment since.

That will be death to the poor mother; her only child.

There is more than this, Carlotta said. The murder was planned. By
whom?

The Murder Gang of the Palace. A club of young criminals headed by Don
Jos, the son of our Dictator, Mr. Ridden. They murdered the lad in that
tunnel or passage where the windmills used to be. I have been with the
murderer. Heres a copy of his confession, made before Chacon, the
notary. Ive sent copies of it to Chavez and Hermengildo, as well as to
your brother, Carlotta. Who could want food after this? Now the Whites
move again; we have a cause and a case.

This Murder Club was founded by Don Jos at the end of last year as a
new excitement; he and eight young men are the members; all very select.
They have now murdered five men; one a month is their rule, each in a
different way.

Pablo Hinestrosa was chosen to kill Estifanio. Two of the others came
to help him; four were posted, to keep guard during the murder; the
other two brought Estifanio to the place.

I learned all this from Pablos own lips this morning.

Pablo Hinestrosa was always as weak as water, Rosa said. Cruel, too;
I remember him putting worms under his rocking horse as a little child.

I found Pablo in the street, as I came back from my ride this morning,
Don Manuel continued. He was crying and quaking; so I brought him to my
rooms. Bit by bit, I got the story out of him.

One moment, Manuel, Carlotta said; this Hinestrosa man, who is
plainly of weak intelligence, may have imagined all this.

Ah, no, alas, Don Manuel said, I have proved it to be true. One
decoyed the victim to the carriage, one drove the carriage to the
tunnel. Then the decoy led him into the tunnel, where Pablo killed him.
Don Jos helped in the killing. There were the tracks and the body,
everything corresponded exactly.

You will think this next a strange thing:

Don Jos is very clever as well as very vicious. He and Spallo took
Pablo home after the murder, and, as they saw that he was shaken, they
feared that he would betray them.

Now Pablo feared that they feared this, so he contrived to leave them
where he could hear them talking. He heard Don Jos say: I knew that he
would be sentimental. He will confess the whole thing to the first
priest he can find. Shall we finish him? It would be rather a neat end
to the night. It must have been an anxious moment for Pablo, waiting
for the answer; but Spallo said, Better not. . . . Hell be all right
after a sleep.

After that, Spallo and Jos went away, but now another strange thing
happened. When they had gone (so Pablo says) the ghost of Estifanios
father came in and sat beside him. He never spoke, but whenever Pablo
tried to run from the room, this ghost slid in front of him.

What happened then?

Pablo said that he burned the ghost away, with matches and texts of
Scripture. When the ghost was gone he ran into the street; but it was
worse there, he said, because Estifanio kept looking through the windows
at him.

I got a doctor to give him an opiate; now hes asleep in Chacons
house.

God give us mercy, Donna Emilia said. Is there to be no measure to
the wickedness of this time?

When will General Chavez know of this? Carlotta asked.

Now. Hell be in town by six. Congress meets at eight. We will arraign
the palace on this question.

God help this unhappy land, Donna Emilia said.

God is helping this land, Don Manuel said. He gives us this sword
against the Lopez gang; now we shall end them.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Manuel and Carlotta, and to set up the conflict between the two. Manuel is a passionate idealist who is committed to fighting injustice, while Carlotta is a more pragmatic thinker who is skeptical of Pablo's story. This disagreement between the two will drive the plot forward.
