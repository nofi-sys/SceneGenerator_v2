SCENE:
XIV


COLONEL McCLINTOCK AGREES WITH VICKY

The pink of apple blossoms was in Mollies cheeks, the flutter of a
covey of quails in her blood. At the least noise her startled heart
jumped. Sometimes it sang with a leaping joy beyond control. Again it
was drenched with a chill dread. The Confederacy had made its last grand
gesture at Appomattox. A million men and more were homeward bound. Scot
McClintock had written that to-day, on his way back to Virginia City
from the front, he would stop off at Carson for a few hours.

She was afraid to meet him. In the hour when they had talked over their
decision she had begged him never to see her again, to put her out of
his mind as though he had never met her. The fear lurked in the
hinterland of her mind that perhaps he had done this. He had been a
soldier, busy with the work given him to do, rising step by step by the
force of his personality. Was it likely he still cherished the wild
love, fruition of which had been denied them?

Mollie had always pushed far back into her secret consciousness the
sweet memories of Scot that had persisted. It had been a matter of duty.
Her code bound her to the view that she could not be the wife of one
man, though in name only, and at the same time love another even in the
secret recesses of her soul. Yet it was never hidden from her that she
loved Scot. No power within her could change that. All she could do was
to flog herself because of it.

And to-day he was coming back, covered with honour and glory. Was she
going to meet a stranger or the ardent friend who had brought colour
into her life?

Into the house burst a girl, shining in the radiance and clean strength
of her young teens. She was slim and straight and dark, and in her eager
face glowed a wonderful colour that came and went as the flame of her
emotions quickened or died. With a whirlwind rush of her supple body she
launched herself on her sister.

Oh, MollieMollie darling, she cried. Its been the _longest_ time
since I saw you. What made you stay so long up in Virginia? And who did
you see there? Tell me all about _everything_.

A soft flame beat into the older sisters cheeks. Victorias enthusiasm
was always a tonic for her.

Ive had a letter fromfrom Colonel McClintock, she said. He expects
to pass through Carson this morning.

Vicky hugged her again. Oh, goody, goody! Three _whacking_ cheers for
our colonel. It was characteristic of her speech that stressed words
stood out like telegraph poles on a railroad track.

Hes not our colonel, reproved Mollie gently.

Hes mine, answered Vicky. Isnt he my guardian? And doesnt he send
me the _best_ present every Christmas? He likes you, too. Think I dont
know, Sis?

Mollies startled eyes fastened to those of Vicky. She was always being
surprised by the acute observation of this helter-skelter youngster. Of
course she couldnt know, but

Why dont you marry him, now youve got a divorce? the child rushed on
with the ruthless innocence of her age.

The colour poured into Mollies cheeks. How you talk! she gasped.
About things you know nothing about. HeColonel McClintockhas been a
good friend to us. You mustnt get foolish notions.

Theyre _not_ foolish. She had Mollie in her arms once more. Why
dont you marry him, dearest? I would. Id snap him up. N him a
herodecorated for bravery, like the _Enterprise_ said.

Mollies eyes fell. You mustnt talk that way, she breathed
tremulously. Youre only a girl, and you dont know anything about it.

But I just do, triumphed Vicky. You think youd stand in his way or
_somepn_ now hes a big officer. Or you think

I think your imagination is too active, dear, Mollie countered drily.
You havent the least reason to think there is anything but friendship
between me and Colonel McClintock.

Vicky caught her by the shoulders. Sister Mollie, can you tell me,
honest Injun, that you dont love him?

The gaze of Mollie wavered before the steady searching eyes of
inexorable youth.
