Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
"Six months after Rudolph died neither I nor Melusine had the slightest
suspicion of what was to follow. I was occupied exclusively with my
duties as sovereign and surprised myself with my punctiliousness in
carrying them out. I presided at the Diet and council meetings. I signed
decrees, summoned the tribunals, appointed officials--to the
satisfaction of all concerned, I think. The town of Lautenburg was never
more prosperous than under my rule.

"Hagen, on the other hand, was uneasy. I watched him grow more morose
every day. After some time, hating the company of a face as long as a
fiddle, I called him up and told him to explain himself or go on leave.
He fell at my feet.

"'How could I be anything else,' he sobbed, 'when you are going to be
another's?'

"He was very much surprised when I told him I didn't know what he meant.

"'How can that be,' he muttered, 'for at Berlin, and even here,
they talk of nothing but your approaching marriage to Duke
Frederick-Augustus?'

"It was too much this time! The woman I pride myself on being can be
married once, by surprise. But twice!

"When Hagen, who was in the habit of going to Berlin several times a
month, had told me the story, I realized that something serious was
afoot. I had a clearer understanding of affairs next morning, when I
received a letter from my father. It was all too plain that he had been
carefully coached, taken on his weak side--his desire to see his
daughter a queen.

"I hate worrying you with dynastic details, but I must prepare you for
what follows. I'll make them as short as possible. Why had I become
Grand Duchess of Lautenburg? In order that I might realize Papa's
ambition and become Queen of Wrtemberg on the death of King Albert.
The Lautenburg succession is not subject to the Salic Law, so that I
still remained Grand Duchess on Rudolph's death. On the other hand, the
succession to the throne of Wrtemberg is governed by that law. So we
have this situation: only a Grand Duke of Lautenburg can mount the
throne of Wrtemberg. Therefore, before I could be Queen of Wrtemberg
I must first marry Duke Frederick-Augustus and thereby make him the
Grand Duke of Lautenburg-Detmold.

"The sole object of Papa's letter was to reconcile me to that marriage.

"I'm afraid that in my reply, which was exceedingly prompt, I rather
forgot the respect a daughter owes her father, whatever he does.

"But you can realize how exasperated I was. Was I to be forced to marry
every German prince in turn? What a prospect for one who had never
wanted to marry at all!

"About a week passed, and then I received a letter from the Empress.
I've no doubt she called me her 'dear child,' and overwhelmed me with
friendly flattery, but there was no mistake about the firm invitation to
go to Berlin with which that letter concluded....

"You can imagine that if I submitted it was less from a sense of
obedience than from the desire to fathom any plot that was being hatched
at Court for my benefit.

"I took Melusine and Hagen with me. The Empress received me with
considerable confusion as I had anticipated, and her explanation was
characteristic. Need I say what it was?


"'Tis not love that must rule a princess and her fate,
To obey is the glory and end of her state.


"Love! Obey! What was the good of my protesting that her reasoning was
false; that I had never loved any one, and that in any case I hadn't
married to obey the first time. Poor Rudolph wasn't there to produce our
little compact which absolved me from those very obligations. And,
anyhow, what was the good of arguing with a worthy dame who was merely
repeating her lesson?

"I listened, my lips pressed together, and said nothing. She got
thoroughly muddled, and when she had finished I asked:

"'May I ask your Majesty what date has been fixed for my marriage with
the Grand Duke Frederick-Augustus?'

"She protested that the Kaiser had never had any idea of precipitating
matters, and that no date had been settled.

"'Only the principle!' I said.

"She didn't answer.
