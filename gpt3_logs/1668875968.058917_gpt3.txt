SCENE:
XXVI


Lillian Byrd kept in her cabin most of the day after she sent her
dispatch to the Gazette, leaving it only for meals and slipping back
to it the moment these were finished. Although she had done only what
she had felt to be her duty, she yet shrank from facing Ouro Preto and
confessing her action.

She knew that he would not consider her last words final, but would
urge her to change them; and it was largely the fear that she might not
be as steadfast as she wanted to be that led her to send the dispatch
giving McNew the information that she had gained and urging him to lay
it before the President of the country. She felt that the count had a
powerful influence over her, and that she could be sure of herself only
when it was out of her power to accede to his wishes. Later she felt
really afraid to face him.

Face him she must sooner or later, however. Even if he remained
quiescent she could not well seclude herself for the remainder of the
trip; and few things seemed to be more certain than that he would
not remain quiescent. He would insist on seeing her; the fact that he
left her in peace for twenty-four hours merely showed either that he
was content to let her consider matters quietly, or that he, too, was
uncertain as to what was to be done.

Lillian was not ordinarily a coward, and after a days reflection the
situation grew intolerable to her, and she determined to give the count
an opportunity to bring matters to a focus. Bitter as his reproaches
might be, they could not be worse than the anticipation of them. She
would face him and bear his words as best she might.

Evening therefore saw her upon the deck in the self-same spot where he
had found her the evening before--waiting.

She waited long! Daylight waned and vanished. The crescent moon
flashed out for an hour and then followed the sun below the horizon,
leaving the big stars as sole lights in the firmament. She looked aft
across the water to where the three lights of Ouro Pretos yacht had
burned night after night, and noted that they were closer than she had
ever seen them before. Little by little the decks had grown empty as
the passengers had slipped away to more congenial occupations than
watching the white boiling spume of the wake and listening to the
swish of the waves along the steamers sides. One or two soft-footed
figures--stewards or sailors engaged in ships tasks--moved ghost-like
beneath the awnings, but if any others were still on deck they were
hidden in the shadows. For all that Lillian could see she was alone.

Four bells struck and still the count had not come. Lillian did not
know whether to be glad or angry. On the one hand she was relieved
to be spared what he might say; on the other she was woman enough to
resent his neglect, as if he had found her further actions or words
unimportant. When he did come at last she was in the mood for combat
rather than apology.

He bowed as he came up, and wished her a good-evening. Then for a few
moments he stood looking down at her in silence, not as if hesitating
as to what he was to say, but rather as one acting in accordance with
some set plan.

I have come for my answer, he said, at last, with a tremor in his
voice. Will you give it to me?

Your answer? Amazement drove all other emotion from Lillians mind.
Not thus had she expected Ouro Preto to address her.

Yes! Surprise, real or pretended, sounded in the Brazilians tones.
But, yes! I asked you to marry me last night and you ran away without
answering. Ah! Senorita. You do not know what this day has been to me!
One moment I hope! the next I despair. I love you, senorita. Will you
not say that you too love me!

Lillians thoughts whirled, aimless as the spray from the steamers
bow. But--but-- she gasped. The Emperor! Your great plot! You--All
of it.

Ouro Preto stared. Then he laughed gently. Por Dios! senorita! he
cried. Have you not forgotten that--that bombast?

Bombast?

But yes! He waved his hand airily. Nothing more! Waste no more
thought over it. It is gone! But you remain--you and I! Will you not
think of my suit. Ah! Senorita! If you but understand how I love you!

But Lillian shook her head. I can not forget it, she declared,
stubbornly, refusing to be diverted. I cannot forget it. I wish I
could. I am ashamed that I should have imposed upon you as I did. I
wish that you had not told me but now that you have done so, I cannot
forget and I cannot keep it secret. In fact, I must tell you that I
have already--


BRIEF OUTLINE:

==========

Lillian Byrd spends the day in her cabin after sending a dispatch to the Gazette, unsure of how to face Count Ouro Preto. She knows he will not be happy with her actions, but decides it is better to face him than to hide. When he finally appears, she is ready for a fight. He tells her that he has come for his answer, but she is surprised to hear him say this. He explains that he asked her to marry him the night before and she ran away without answering. Lillian is caught off guard and does not know how to respond. Ouro Preto continues, telling her that he loves her and asking if she feels the same. Lillian is conflicted, torn between her feelings for the Count and her duty to her country. In the end, she tells him that she cannot forget or forgive his actions and she has already told someone about his plot.
