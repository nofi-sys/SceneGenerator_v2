Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Mikel brought it out dumbly and laid it on the counter. The man put it
in a pouch sewed into his lower garment.

"I didn't do it! I didn't!" Mikel cried despairingly. He had lost his
appetite completely.

"Sh! We don't want a fuss here. I am rechecking your timeporter,
Citizen Skot. We are going back immediately."

"I--I didn't even know the girl!" Mikel pleaded, remembering Beti
French's instructions.

"We shall see as to that, when we get home," said the TTT executive
grimly.

Then suddenly he burst out laughing. He laughed until he had to take a
small piece of white material from his upper garment and wipe his eyes.

"I meant to give you a good scare, to put some sense into you," he
gasped finally. "But I can't keep it up. Citizen Skot, you are a fool."

"I know that, Citizen," said Mikel humbly.

"The psychologists really conditioned you a bit too well. I am told
that you live for your work and have no recreation at all. You are as
ignorant of the world as a small child. Come, did you ever hear of a
murder in our time, anywhere, in all your life?"

"No. But I know such things occur."

"In the past, not in our time. How could there be a murder in our era?
In the old times, people killed one another for jealousy, for revenge,
for greed. Such incentives do not exist in the 29th century. The only
other possibility would be insanity, and the psychologists would never
allow that to proceed to such a point--the diseased person would be
euthanized at the very first symptoms."

"But the girl _was_ killed, right before my eyes."

"My poor man, you were a victim of your own ridiculously retired
existence. Anyone else would have guessed at once. It was planned that
way so as to get a good effect of a crowd in confusion--most of them
were extras. Of course all the arrangements had been made with us
beforehand, and the concealed telcams were focused away from any Time
Travel signs."

"Telecams?"

"World Theater was making a historical crime tridimens in modern
dress, Citizen Skot. The girl was an actress. The blood was faked.
They thought it would be more effective not to put an actor behind the
ticket-window, but to use a real ticket-seller without warning him,
just as part of the crowd wasn't warned. It worked beautifully--they
tell me your fright and horror showed up wonderfully well.

"They picked your window because they said they liked your looks--I
can't imagine why. That was their big mistake. Any other of our
ticket-sellers would have waited to see what happened next. You, you
dumble, fell into a panic and ran away. And I've had to leave my desk
in the middle of a busy aftern to go and fetch you. We couldn't let
you wander around here for a week without means of subsistence, and
thinking you were suspected of murder!"

"I suppose I'll be demoted now," Mikel said gloomily.

"That wouldn't be fair. This wasn't one of the known responsibilities
of your position. No, but I imagine you'll come in for a lot of
whiffing, to use a slang expression."

"Kidding--that's what they call it here, I think. Well, I'm used to
that."

"And Dafne Dart says she's wild to meet you."

"Dafne Dart? Who's she?" Mikel looked alarmed again.

"Your performance made a tremend impression on her. She told me to tell
you she thinks 'you're purely vlumpish.' She's the actress who played
the murder victim."

"That red-haired girl with the green eyes with flecks of amber in
them?" asked Mikel eagerly. "With the streely smile and the gorge
voice?"

"You seem to have noticed her," said the TTT executive dryly. "Yes,
that's the one. I thought you didn't go for women."

"But that's different!" Mikel Skot caroled. "Redheads with green
eyes--that's the one kind that crashes me and that I crash--I just
found it out today.
