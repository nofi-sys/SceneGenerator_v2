SCENE:
His wife, Sarah Ridden, was fond of this son, but wished that he would
be like others boys, not always messing about with cog-wheels. Her
children had gone from her into the world, with the exception of her
daughter Bell, a year older than the boy. She found life easier with the
boy out of the house, not putting my old mans back up. Quiet life,
the Liverpool Spring Meeting and asparagus were the things she loved
best; but she was a fine rider and understood horses.

Bell Ridden, the daughter, was a lovely, shy girl, worshipped by her
father and mother. As she lived at home, she helped her father in the
stable: she was clever with horses; the stable boys loved her: she got
more out of them than Bill could. It was her instinct that sent the
Lilybud to Mandarin, by which Bill got Chinese White, the horse which
won him his glory.

The five older children were scattered: Polly and Sally married, Harold
in a line regiment, Chilcote and Rowton in the city, in copper.

This brings us to the youngest son, Highworth Foliat Ridden, the Hi of
these pages, the lad who had not yet found what he could do. He was of
the middling height and build, with brown hair, and a pleasant, freckled
face, somewhat puckered at the eyes from his habit of not wearing a hat.
His eyes were grey-blue, under eyebrows darker than one would expect
from the eyes: his nose was a small pug nose, neatly made and set. His
ears were well made and placed. His mouth was wide, pleasant,
thin-lipped and firm. He was a nice-looking lad, who would have done
well enough under other parents, or with none.

Being the last of the seven, he came at a time when both his parents had
had enough of children, but wanted, as they said, a filly to finish up
with. As Hi turned out to be a colt, or as Bill put it, another of
these buck pups to have about, he was a disappointment to them from the
first.

He went to the school where the other Riddens had been, he got his
second eleven colours in his last summer term; but learned nothing; he
was always messing about with cog-wheels.

In the Christmas holidays Bill called him into his study, where he
kept two hunting horns, six long hunting-pictures by Henry Alken, seven
foxes masks (one of them almost white, killed in the winter of the
great frost), eleven crops on a rack, three small oil portraits of
Moonbird, Sirocco and Peter, much tobacco of all sorts, and many bottles
of liqueur, made by himself.

Now, Highworth, he said, youve come to an age now when youve got to
decide what to do. Youve had a first-rate education; at least, if you
havent, its your own fault, I know its cost enough. Now what are you
going to be? What do you want to do?

Well, sir, as you know, Ive always wanted to be an engineer.

Ive already gone into that, boy. I thought you knew my mind on that
point once for all. But its the kind of answer I expected from this
last report of yours. You waste your time at an expensive public school
messing with toy engines with that young maniac you persuaded us to
invite here, and then say you want to be an engineer. A nice thing it
would be for your mother and sister to see you a . . . mechanic doing
the drains with a spanner. By God, boy, youve got a fine sense of
pride, I dont think.

Hi said that engineering was a fine profession and that lots of people
went in for it.

What do you know about its being a fine profession?

Because it gives men all sorts of power, sir.

Power be damned, boy. Power to stink of paraffin whenever they go out
to dinner; though that must be seldom, even now, Im glad to think.

Sir James Russel was a fine man, sir; and so was William Horrocks, who
made the Gartishan Dam.

Sir James Russel may have been God Almighty, for all I know or care; I
never heard of him; but William Horrocks I do know, or at least know of,
for his uncle was old John Horrocks, the mealman down at Kill Hill, and
a dirtier, old, snuffy scoundrel I never saw out of an almshouse.

I dont know what his uncle was, sir.

No, boy, but if you will let me say so, the point is, that I do.

Yes, sir, but I am talking of William Horrocks.

I think I understand as much. I am merely pointing out to you, in the
teeth of a great deal of interruption, that your hero was a man whom no
one here would touch with a barge-pole or have inside his house.

Sir, a man ought not to be judged by what his uncle is, but by what he
is in himself.
