SCENE:
XIII

DISCOVERY


Do you know I think it would be fine if we went off some day this week
on a picnic, Laura said unexpectedly one morning. I just love to go
on picnics. And we havent had one yet.

Oh Laura! Maida agreed ecstatically, What a wonderful idea! I love
picnics too! I adore picnic food and I never yet have had all the
hard-boiled eggs I want. How did you come to think of it?

I thought of it last night just before I fell asleep. Lauras voice
sparkled with pride. It was all I could do to keep from going in
your rooms and waking you and Rosie up to tell you about it. I was so
excited that I couldnt fall asleep and so I made a perfectly beautiful
plan. I thought we might put up lunches; then get into our bathing
suits; paddle across the Magic Mirror to the other side and spend the
day there--we have never really explored the other side. Im sure its
perfectly lovely there and well have a wonderful time.

Lets do it to-morrow, Rosie took up with Lauras plan immediately.
We can get up early; cook the eggs and make the sandwiches. Therell
be enough cake left over. And dont lets--oh listen, everybody!
Remember not to forget the salt. People always forget the salt on
picnics.

Its ice cream day to-morrow, Harold said sadly. Well miss it if we
are not home to freeze it.

No, if you boys will get up early and make it, we can take it along in
the freezer with us, Rosie suggested daringly.

Sure! Arthur was highly enthusiastic. I dont care how early I have
to get up to make ice cream. Id rather do that than go without it.

All other conversation was banished for the day. They kept thinking of
things they would like to take with them--and stopped only short of the
bicycles.

I should think, Maida said once, that we were going to Africa for
six months at least. Remember one thing though--_dont forget the
salt_!

They were so afraid that they wouldnt wake in time that they wound
their alarm clocks to the very last notch. They did wake in time
however. In fact they had to put the alarm clocks under the bed clothes
and pile pillows on top of them to keep from waking the rest of the
household. With much whispering and many half-suppressed giggles the
girls managed to get into bathing suits; went down stairs and began
their work in the kitchen. Although the exact number of eggs and
sandwiches had been decided on the day before, they held many low-toned
colloquies on the subject.

Remember, Laura said, you can always eat twice as much at a picnic
as anywhere else. I dont know why it is, she concluded thoughtfully,
but even things you dont like taste good. _Be sure not to forget the
salt!_

By the time Floribel appeared to get their breakfasts, they were nearly
famished but nevertheless they ate hurriedly, so great was their
longing to get off. Arthur shouldered the ice cream freezer. Between
them, the girls carried the luncheon. The little children had to be
led to the side of the house, so as not to witness their elaborate
burden-laden departure. As it was acute little Betsy apparently guessed
that something was going on which did not include her. As the Big Six
disappeared down the trail they could hear Granny Flynn soothing her
whimperings.

It was a beautiful day. The sun was not yet high enough in the heavens
for it to be hot. Indeed dew still lay over everything. But there was a
languor in the atmosphere which warned them that it would be hot enough
later. The pond was indeed a Magic Mirror. It was like glass. Not a
ripple roughed its surface and everything on the shore was so perfectly
reflected that it looked painted on the water. The children wasted no
time on the view. They pulled the four canoes out of the boat house
and began loading them. Arthur paddled alone in one with the ice cream
freezer and the lunch. Harold paddled alone in the second with the rugs
and the hammock; the others went, two to a canoe. The little fleet kept
close.

Isnt it a beautiful place? Rosie asked joyously, trailing her hand
in the water, Its like fairy land to-day. How I wish I could see some
fairies or goblins or something strange!

Id be content to see some white peacocks, Dicky said soberly.

Oh Dicky! Maida exclaimed, Ive never taken you to see the white
peacocks as I promised. Ill do that just as soon as I can.
