SCENE:
From above there came a cry.

We got him, Dad! Yay, Teddy! Are you all right? Teddy!

Putting his hand to his head, the boy glanced up. What he saw caused
quick tears of emotion to come to his eyes. Staring down at him,
their faces alight with eagerness, stood his father and Roy.

Dad! Roy! Teddy cried weakly. He staggered to the wall and leaned
against it. There was a lump in his throat that choked him, and try
as he did, he could not keep the tears from starting to his eyes.
This would never do. What would they think of him? He shook his head
savagely and sunk his teeth into his lower lip. There, that helped!
He looked up again.

You sure timed your entrance, he called, grinning bravely. Quite
a show!

Teddy, are you all right? Mr. Manley shouted.

Sure! Come on down. The waters fine. His head was spinning
around, and the red rim of the sun was stretched into a long line of
fire across the sky. To his surprise, the boy suddenly found himself
sitting down. He laughed at the absurdity of this change, but it was
a weak laugh.

Above him, Roy and Mr. Manley had seen the boy sway back and forth
for a moment, then fall to the ground. Swiftly Mr. Manley ran back
to where his pony was standing and detached a rope which hung from
the saddle horn. He tied one end around a tree, and dangling the
other end over the edge, he slid down, careless of the blistering
burns the strands inflicted on the palms of his hands. The moment he
hit bottom he ran to his son.

Teddy! Teddy boy! he stammered. That was a close one! If Roy and
I had missed-- He hunched down and threw one arm about his sons
shoulders. Even Mr. Manleys eyes were not quite dry. He had just
seen his son escape from a horrible death.

All right, Dad. Im O. K. now, Teddy said, resting one hand over
his fathers as it lay on his shoulder. Ill give you and Roy the
prize for marksmanship. You sure clipped the beast good!

Hey, Dad, Im coming down! Roy yelled from above. Is Teddy hurt?

No! Mr. Manley answered. Hes not! You stay up there, Roy. Wait
for the rest! Yell at em!

I can get up now, Teddy declared. To prove it he struggled to his
feet, and promptly sat down again.

Golly, my legs are made of India-rubber! he said, grinning. What
do you know about that, Dad? Funny, hey?

Sure, Mr. Manley assented, smiling broadly now. He knew from the
change in Teddys voice that the boy was gaining control of his
nerves and would soon be himself again. Just take it easy, son.
Here! he ran to the spring and dipped his hat in the water. Drink
this. Slow!

Teddy obeyed, and the merry-go-round on which the trees were riding
came gradually to a stop.

The boy got to his feet again, and this time he stayed there.

Wheres my friend? he asked, looking about. Ah, there she is. A
beauty, hey, Dad? he touched the dead mountain lion with his foot.
Look at that hide! Say, do you think we can get her up out of here
and cart her along home?

Dont see why not, his father answered. Golly, boy, do you know
you went for this lion with your bare hands? Went right at her!

Did I? Teddy said indifferently. He kicked the carcass again.
Must have been a little crazy, I guess. I didnt know what it was
all about for a while.

He walked over toward the spring. Suddenly he uttered an
exclamation.

Well, for the love of Pete! Dad! Take a look at this! No wonder the
old lady wanted to fight. Can you beat this?

Mr. Manley hurried to his sons side and bent over. In a scooped-out
hollow of the wall, partly screened by bushes, he saw two little,
yellow kittens.

Baby lions! the ranch owner cried. Say, Teddy, weve got to save
em! We shot their mother, and now its up to us to help the babies
make a start in the world. We can--
