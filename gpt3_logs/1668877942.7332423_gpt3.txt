SCENE:
XVIII

THE MAN WITH THE SCAR


High above the riders, the full moon shone, a white orb set in the
velvet blackness of the sky, lighting the scene with a silvery
radiance. Soon the buildings of the X Bar X were left behind and the
horsemen raced swiftly over the open range. Bug Eye was in the lead,
and he made straight for the spot where he had been held up.

Teddy and Roy were riding side by side, a short distance behind
their father.

If were able to trail the thieves, we may find out something about
our horses! Teddy yelled to his brother.

Hope so, Roy returned. Itll be a good nights work if we do.

On and on they rode. There was little time for conversation, as the
ponies were flashing along at their best speed. They came to an up
grade, at the top of which was Sanborns Point. As they neared their
destination, Mr. Manley called to Teddy:

You an Roy stick close to Bug Eye. Im going to come in from the
left, and see if I can spot the rustlers.

Teddy nodded and spurred his mount onward. Shouting to Nick and Pop
to follow him, Mr. Manley wheeled about in a semicircle. The rest
followed Bug Eye.

Almost there! Bug Eye yelled to Roy. Wheres yore dad goin?

Hes circling around to the left, so he can cut in! Theres a trail
that leads to Hawley--guess you know the one I mean--and dads
figuring on cutting the thieves off, if they went that way!

Good idee!

With a final dash, Bug Eyes party reached Sanborns Point. Bug Eye
held up his hand, and all pulled the horses back.

Right here is where she happened, the puncher said. I was coming
up the hill, and when I got here they jumped me. Then they went over
this rise in the flivver, an I lost sight of em. See! Theres the
tracks of the wheels! Boy, Im sure thankful theres a moon! Now we
can foller them tracks, an we may run into the galoots after all!

As Bug Eye had said, the imprints of the tires led over the hill.
Slowly the punchers followed them, and when the rise was topped
Teddy gave a yell.

The tracks go left from here! Just the way dad went! Come on--lets
go!

Leaving the road, the men followed the tire trail off to the left.
In the soft soil this was not a hard thing to do, and they could
ride faster now and still keep the tracks in sight.

If we ever catch up to them waddies, theyll wish theyd never seen
that tin mule! Bug Eye vowed. Makin me walk all them miles!
Whatd they want with a Lizzie, anyhow? Did they think I was
carryin dust or somethin? By golly, I bet they took the car out of
plain cussedness! They dont want that flivver any more than the man
in the moon!

Seems like youre right, there, Roy agreed. But you never can
tell. Weve got a little account to settle with scar-face, and the
sooner we square it the better.

Say, Bug Eye, you didnt happen to notice whether one of those men
who robbed you had on a checkered shirt, did you? Teddy called out
as he rode along.

Checkered shirt? Well, now that you mention it, I do remember just
that! Long, stringy sort of ranger, with a peaked hat? Yep! Why did
you ask that, Teddy?

Tell you later, Bug Eye, the boy answered. He felt that this was
no time for explanations, when they were riding hard to catch the
man who had taken Flash. Teddy was sorry the flivver had been
stolen. But, he said to himself, whats a flivver compared to
Flash?

Jim Casey, who was riding slightly in the rear, suddenly gave a
yell.

Heres somethin like a box at the side of the road! he called.
Bug Eye looked to where Jim was pointing, and then jumped off his
pony. He ran toward the object, and, bending over, he examined it
carefully.
