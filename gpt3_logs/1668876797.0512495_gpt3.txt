SCENE:
Jimmy Logan stood his skis in the corner behind the door and, tramping
heavily to get the clinging snow from his shoes, climbed the first
flight in Trow Hall slowly and then dragged wearied feet down the
corridor to Number 19. Once inside the room, he said, Hello, shied
his cap onto his bed and sank exhaustedly in the nearest chair,
stretching his legs across the rug and slumping down until the wet
collar of his mackinaw came in contact with his ears. Whereupon he
muttered, Ugh! and sat up another inch or two.

Across the room, one foot on the floor and the other doubled up
beneath him on the windowseat, was Jimmys roommate. His response to
the greeting had been brief and delivered in a preoccupied voice, for
Dudley Baker had a book open before him on the cushion and held a
stained and battered baseball in his right hand. His attention was
divided between book and ball and had no room for Jimmy. The latters
gaze presently came away from his shoes, which were trickling water to
the rug, and fixed itself on Dudley. He had to sit up still higher in
the chair to get an uninterrupted view of his chum, which proceeding
elicited a protesting groan from him, and after he had attained it he
instantly decided that it was not worth while and deeply regretted the
exertion it had caused him. He promptly descended again on his spine,
crossed his feet and sighed luxuriously.

The dollar clock on Dudleys chiffonier ticked briskly and loudly in
the ensuing silence. Outside the windows tiny flakes of snow were
falling. The shadows deepened in the room. In the corridor deliberate
footsteps sounded and suddenly the transom over the door showed yellow
and an oblong of light appeared on the ceiling. Mr. Crump, the school
janitor, was lighting the dormitories. Jimmy wished that his shoes were
off, and his mackinaw, and the woolen socks, but as yet he wasnt equal
to the task. When Mr. Crumps footsteps had died away on the stairs
Jimmy broke the silence.

Whatre you doing? he asked uninterestedly. There was, however, no
reply from the window-seat, possibly because Jimmys tones had been too
faint to reach there. After a moment Jimmy turned his head and stared
across a pile of books on the study table at the three or four inches
of Dudleys head that were visible. Then:

_Dud!_ he bawled resentfully.

Huh?

What are you doing, I asked you.

Oh, me? Oh, just trying to dope out some of this stuff.

What stuff?

Stuff about pitching. How to hold the ball, you know.

Oh! Jimmy subsided again and another period of silence followed. Then:

You dont expect to play baseball for a while, do you? he asked
lazily. Youd better study how to throw a snowball! He chuckled
faintly at his joke.

It isnt so long now, responded Dud soberly. Theyre going to call
candidates the twenty-first.

Gym work, grunted the other. Take my advice and keep away from it.
Dont go out for the team until it gets out of doors. Are you still
thinking of trying for the school?

Of course.

Jimmy grunted. Youll have a fine show, I dont think! Better try for
the second, Dud.

I dont expect to make it, but its good practice, and maybe next
year

Youll stand more chance with the second, and have a lot more fun.
The seconds going to have a regular schedule this year; five or six
games, maybe; going away for some of them, too.

If I dont make the first, and I suppose I wont, of course, Ill try
for the second, said Dud. I asked Murtha this morning if he thought
it would be all right to try for the first, and he said

Guy Murtha said, Yes, indeed, Baker, we want all the candidates we
can get! Thats what they always tell you, and then, when you get
out there, they inform you gently but firmly that you wont do, and
hadnt you better stay with your class team this year and try again
next? Whats the use? I like to play ball, Dud, but you dont catch me
putting in a months grind in the cage and then getting the G. B. as
soon as we get outdoors. Me for the secondand safety.

Youre lazy, replied Dud, shutting his book and stowing the ball back
of the pillows. You could make the first this spring if youd try for
it. You ought to, too.
