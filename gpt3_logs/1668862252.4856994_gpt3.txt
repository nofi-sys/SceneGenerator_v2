SCENE:
XIV.

THE PANIC.


Behind the ramparts of Fort Schuyler, near the present site of the
town of Rome, an officer in the uniform of a Continental colonel, was
standing in the twilight, looking out over the beleaguering camp of
St. Leger, with his Tories and Indians, at the siege batteries. The
increasing gloom alone made the situation tenable, for all day long the
Indian riflemen had been lying down outside the fort, behind stumps and
logs, picking off every one who ventured to show his head above the
rampart.

The position of the fort had been growing more desperate daily, for
its defenses were but slight at the best of times, and St. Legers
artillery had been battering at them steadily ever since the siege
first began, three weeks before. Provisions were growing scarce, and
the Indian scouts, constantly creeping closer to the fort, rendered a
sortie for forage impossible.

Colonel Gansevoort, the American leader, looked anxious and gloomy.
Before his men and the enemy he kept up appearances nobly, but now that
he was alone, the desolate nature of his position rushed on his mind
with overpowering force, and compelled a feeling of almost despair.

Two weeks before, the column sent to his relief under General Herkimer,
had been repulsed and almost annihilated, at the desperate battle of
Oriskany, and since that time not a word had reached him from the outer
world, save through the threatening dispatches of his foes.

All round the fort stretched the silent, primeval forest, for Fort
Schuyler was then at the extreme bounds of civilization. Out of those
woods came nothing but the whoop of the beleaguering savage, the
spiteful crack of the rifle-shot, and the booming report of the brass
howitzers.

There was not a ray of hope apparent to tell the Americans whether
they were not vainly persisting in a struggle which could have but one
termination, torture and death at the stake from the merciless allies
of the English General.

As Gansevoort was thus looking from the low log parapet, at the
twinkling circle of English fires, he was surprised to hear a low voice
from the ditch of the bastion on which he stood, calling him by name.
Starting, he hastily asked:

Whos there!

A friend, replied the low voice, with news from Schuyler. Come down
to the sallyport, for I must away when I have given my news.

Without a moments hesitation the colonel left the rampart, and
hastened down to the sallyport spoken of by the other. This was a low
heavy door on the inner side of the ditch, approached by an underground
passage, and protected by the fire of two faces of the fort, and the
colonel emerged from this, finding himself confronted by a figure of
great hight, but thin and attenuated as a specter. This figure was
wrapped in a long, flowing cloak, and its face was hidden by a broad,
shadowy hat.

Under any circumstances, it is probable that Gansevoort would have felt
some distrust of the other, but as it was, he was too eager to hear the
news to be particular about how it came.

The news, quick, man, what is it? he whispered. Good or bad?

Good, answered the stranger, in the same low tone. Read this letter.

As he spoke, he extended both arms, the shadowy cloak hanging from
them, so as to conceal what passed from the view of any lurking
besieger. Gansevoort then noticed, for the first time, that the other
bore, at his belt, a small dark-lantern. He eagerly grasped the letter
which the stranger extended to him, and beheld the well-known bold
clerkly hand of General Schuyler. Quickly he ran it over.

[2]STILLWATER, August 15th, 1777.

DEAR COLONEL: A body of troops left this place yesterday,
and others are following to raise the siege of Fort Schuyler.
Everybody here believes you will defend it to the last, and
I strictly enjoin you so to do. General Burgoyne is at Fort
Edward--our army at Stillwater--great reinforcements coming
from the eastward, and we trust all will be well and the enemy
repulsed.

Yours faithfully,
PH. SCHUYLER.

COLONEL GANSEVOORT,
Comdg Post at Fort Schuyler,
By Capt. Erastus Benedict, A. D. C.
