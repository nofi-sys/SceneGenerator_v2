SCENE:
VI

AFTERNOON


A gypsy camp! Arthur repeated. Sure Id love to go.

Gypsies! Laura shrank a little. I think Id be scared of gypsies.

You wouldnt be scared of these gypsies, Maida promised. Ive known
them ever since I was a little girl. I am very fond of them.

Well lets go, Arthur said, shifting from one foot to another in
impatient excitement.

The procession started again.

Tell us more about the gypsies, Maida, Arthur demanded at once.

There isnt very much to tell, except that theyve come here every
summer ever since I can remember and, indeed, long before I was born.
Father has always permitted them to camp on this ground, rent free. I
dont seem to remember much about them when I was very little, except
that I used to go and buy baskets with Granny Flynn and they always
told Grannys fortune. Cross my palm with silver, they say. That
means, Put some money in my hand!

How many are there? Dicky enquired.

Not many. Perhaps a dozen. Let me see theres Aunt Save and Uncle Save
the father and mother, and Aunt Vashti, the old, old grandmother. She
would frighten even you, Rosie--She looks like a witch. But shes very
kind and Im very fond of her. And theres Esther and Miriam, their
daughters and Hector and Tom, their husbands; and their children. And
then there are always three or four relatives--different ones every
year--who come up from the South with them.

They go South then every winter? Arthur continued.

Yes, Maida answered. She continued to give them her memories of the
gypsies through the rest of the long, shaded, greenly-winding walk, and
the children asked many questions. Presently the trail expanded ahead
into a clearing.

There they are! Arthur called.

The clearing was surrounded by pines. Against this background, a group
of tents pointed their weather-stained pyramids up from the brown
pine-needles. In the middle, a fire was burning. A black pot, hanging
from a triangle of stout sticks, emitted a cloud of steam and a busy
bubbling. A wagon stood off among the trees and tethered by a long
rope two horses were feeding. A trio of hounds, two old and one young,
rose as the children approached; made slowly in their direction. An
old woman, so wrinkled that her face looked as though it could never
have been smooth, with great hoops of gold in her ears, a red kerchief
on her head and a black one around her neck, stood watching the pot. A
little distance off, a younger woman, buxom and brown, mended. Three
men, one middle-aged, two younger, sat smoking.

Those dogs wont bite us Maida, Laura said in a panic, will they?

Oh no, Maida said, they know me. Hi Lize! Hi Tige! she called.
The hounds burst into a run; came bounding to her side; leaped up
and licked her face. Maida staggered under the onslaught, but Arthur
expertly seized their collars, held them.

The excitement in the gypsy camp was immediate. Its Maida! ran a
murmur from mouth to mouth. The young woman leaped to her feet. The old
woman, less alert but still nimble, sprang from the grass also. They
all, even the men, came forward, smiling eagerly. Maida shook hands
with them and introduced her friends.

When did you get here? Maida asked. Ive had Zeke come down here
every day for a week looking for you--every day until yesterday, when
in the excitement of our arrival, he neglected to come.

We came yesterday, they explained. They were most of them, dark, with
longish hair and flashing dark eyes but their look was very friendly.
They asked Maida a multitude of questions about her father and Granny
Flynn, her trip abroad. Finally Maida asked them if they had any
baskets ready for sale.

A few, Mrs. Savory said looking pleased. Oh Silva, bring the baskets
out! Maida you have never seen Silva and Tyma, have you? Theyre my
sisters children. My sister died last summer and now theyre living
with us.

A voice answered, In a moment. It was a childs voice and yet it
had a curious grown-up accent as of an unusual decision of character.
The doors of one of the tents parted and a girls head appeared in
the opening. The children stared at her. For an instant nobody spoke.
The head disappeared. When the girl emerged, her hands were full of
baskets. Behind her came a lad very like her but older.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the gypsy camp and its inhabitants. The author achieves this by having Maida describe the camp and its inhabitants to the other children.
