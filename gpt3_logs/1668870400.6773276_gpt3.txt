SCENE:
"What a reckless talker you are, Amy!" Jessie said, smiling. "And I
will not hear you run Darry down. I think too much of him myself."

"Don't let him guess it," said the absent Darry's sister, with a grin.
"It will spoil him--make him proud and hard to hold."

"That's a good one!" laughed Nell. "You think Darry can be as easily
spoiled by praise as the Chinese servant Reverend tells about that he
had in California. This was before I was born. Father and mother got
a Coolie right at the dock. You could do that in those days. And John
scarcely knew a word of English, not even the pidgin variety.

"But Reverend says that when John acquired a few English words he was
so proud that there was no holding him. He asked the name of every new
object he saw and mispronounced it usually in the most absurd manner.
Once John found a sparrow's nest in the grapevine and shuffled into
Reverend's study to tell him about it.

"'Is there anything in the nest yet, John?' Reverend asked him.

"'Yes,' the Chinaman declared, puffed up with his knowledge of the new
language, 'Spallow alle samme got pups.'"

While they chattered and laughed the three girls were as busy as bees
with the new radio arrangement. Amy said that Jessie kept them so hard
at work that it did not seem at all as though they were "vacationing."
It was good, healthy work for all.

"It does seem awfully quiet here without Hen," went on Amy, hammering
on a board with a heavy hammer and making the big room where the radio
set was, ring. "She keeps the place almost as tomb-like as a boiler
shop--what?"

"You can make a little noise yourself," Jessie told her. "What's all
the hammering for?"

"So things won't sound too tame. How are we getting on with the new
circuit?"

"Why, Amy Drew! you just helped me place this vario-coupler. Didn't you
know what you were doing?"

"Not a bit," confessed Amy. "You are away out of my depth, Jess. And
don't try to tell me what it all means, that's a dear. I never can
remember scientific terms."

"Put up the hammer," said Nell, laughing. "You are a confirmed knocker,
anyway, Amy. But I admit I do not understand this tangle of wires."

They did not seek to disconnect the old regenerative set that day, for
there was much of interest expected out of the ether before the day
was over. One particular thing Jessie looked for, but she had said
nothing about it to anybody save her very dearest chum, Amy, and the
clergyman's daughter, Nell.

Two days before she had done some telephoning over the long-distance
wire. Of course there was a cable to the mainland from Station
Island, and Jessie had called up and interviewed Mark Stratford at
Stratfordtown.

Mark was a college friend of Darry and Burd, but he was likewise a
very good friend of the Roselawn girls and he had reason for being. As
related in a previous volume, "The Radio Girls on the Program," Jessie
and Amy had found a watch Mark had lost, and as it was a valuable
watch and had been given him by his grandmother, Mark was very grateful.

Through his influence--to a degree--Jessie and Amy had got on the
program at the Stratfordtown broadcasting station. And now Jessie had
talked with the young man and arranged for a surprise by radio that was
to come off that very evening at "bedtime story hour."

Henrietta and little Sally and Bob and Fred Stanley, as well as some of
the other children of the bungalow colony, crowded into the house at
that time to "listen in" on the Roselawn girls' instrument.

The amplifier worked all right that evening, and Jessie was very glad.
The little folks arranged themselves on the chairs and settees with
some little confusion while Jessie tuned the set to the Stratfordtown
length of wave. There was some static, but after a little that
disappeared and they waited for the announcement from the faraway
station.

By and by, as Henrietta whispered, the radio began to "buzz." "Now
we'll get it!" cried the little Dogtown girl. "I hope it is about the
little boy with the rabbit ears that he could wiggle."

"S-sh!" commanded Jessie, making a gesture for silence.

And then out of the air came a deep voice:
