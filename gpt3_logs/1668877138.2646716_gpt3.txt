SCENE:
I suppose so, agreed the other rather listlessly. Theyve been
awfully nice to me

You bet! And a lot of their crowd, too. Why, say

But I dont, somehow, care so much about beingbeing a regular
feller as I did, Jimmy. IId rather be a good pitcher.

Isnt that human nature? demanded Jimmy, apparently of the ceiling.
Just as soon as a fellow gets what he wants, he doesnt want it! You
make me tired, Dud! Here Ive schemed and labored for you

I know, and Im awfully much obliged, said Dud soberly. Onlyplease
dont do it any more, Jimmy. Ive had enough of it, I guess.

My dear demented friend, youve just started! You mustnt think that
just because Hobo Ordway and Nick Blake and Bert Winslow and a few of
that close corporation have taken you up that the battles won. Far be
it from such! The funs only started, son. Youve got two years here
yet and you want to make hay while the sun shines. Just you leave it to
me

No, you leave it to me now, said Dud. I guess its like Blake said;
every fellow must hoe his own row. Andand I havent got time toto
be popular, Jimmy. I just want to get so I can pitch like Ben Myatt.

Say, thats hitching your wagon to a star, all right; Ben being the
star! Maybe youre right, though. Theres always the danger of
having fellows think youre trying too hard; and they dont like that.
Maybe your scheme is the best, Dud. Foxy, too, I call it.

I havent any scheme, denied the other impatiently. I just want to
quit thinking anything about whether fellows like me or dont like me.
I guess if they do it will be becausebecause I dont care!

Thats what Im saying, said Jimmy, grinning exasperatingly. Just
let them think you dont care a fig and theyll flock to you. Yep,
thats a good idea, Dud.

Jimmy, if folks didnt know you better theyd think sometimes that you
were a regularregular

Feller? asked Jimmy helpfully.

Bounder!

Oh! Thank you kindly. And such is gratitude! Never mind, son, all you
need is food. Lets get to it.

I dont thinkthat is, Im not very hungry

Not hungry! Youre not sick, are you? Dud shook his head. Then
whats wrong with you?

Well, if you must know, replied the other desperately, II dont
want to go over there and see the fellows grinning at me.

Grinning at you? What would they be doing Say, for the love of
lemons, Dud, get that idea out of your bean! Why, no ones grinning at
you, you three-ply chump! Why should they? Didnt you go in there and
save our bacon for us? Didnt you work three innings like a regular
Matty? Sure, you did! Then what

And I went to pieces, too, and filled the bases that time, said Dud
bitterly. Even if they dont grin I shall know they want to!

Piffle! Honest, Dud, I didnt know you were such a chump. Look here,
youve been wondering again! Dont tell me! I can see it. Youve got
your I-wonder expression on! You stop thinking about Dud Baker and
wash your dirty face and hands and come to eats. Ill guarantee that
you wont get grinned at once, old man. If I see any fellow trying it
Ill punch his head!

After all, Dud only wanted to be reassured and had no real intention of
missing his supper, for he was undeniably hungry. And so, presently,
they were off to dining-hall together, and things were just as Jimmy
had predicted. There were no grins, save an occasional friendly one,
and no one paid much more attention to Dud than usual. They slipped
into their places at tableneither had been called to the training
table yet, since accommodations at that board were very limitedand
Jimmy, in high spirits, bandied remarks with the others between
mouthfuls, and Dud tried hard to forget anything that had happened
since luncheon.

There was, naturally, much talk of the game and much criticism of
various plays, as there always was, and Jimmy, as a participant, was
listened to with respect if not with entire credence. At the training
table, across the hall, there were no signs of depression, if one could
judge by the talk and laughter. In fact, the whole school was looking
back on the afternoons contest as something very much like a lucky
victory. And perhaps it was. At all events, a comparison of the scores
showed that Lawrence had made more hits and fewer errors and that the
renowned Mr. Fairway had behaved more creditably than the four Grafton
pitchers judged together.
