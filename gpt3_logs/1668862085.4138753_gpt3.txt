SCENE:
In the midst of the lonely forest, that stretched in an almost unbroken
line of solitude from the head-waters of the Hudson to the Mississippi,
during the last century, a small party of Indian warriors, in full
war-paint, treading one in the others footsteps, to the number of
five, stole into a little clearing formed by the hand of Nature, and
halted by a spring.

The sun was about to set, in an angry glow of crimson, that portended
bad weather. The fiery beams shot aslant through the open arches of the
forest, and the trunks of the trees stood out, as black as jet, against
the red glow of evening.

He has not been here, remarked the warrior who seemed to be the
leader, as he scanned the earth around the little spring with a
practiced eye.

The pale-faces are all liars, said a young brave, disdainfully, as he
leant upon his bow. When was a Mohawk known to break his word?

The Panther Cub is wrong, he said, quietly. There are good and bad
pale-faces. I have never known the white chief to fail before. He has
been stopped on the way. He will soon come, and show us how to strike
the children who have rebelled against the great father who dwells
beyond the sea.

The Mohawk needs no white teacher, returned Panther Cub, in the same
tone. I can find a house to strike, and scalps to take, long before
the morning dawns, if need be.

Has the Black Fox lost his eyes, that Panther Cub thinks he is the
only Mohawk that can see in the night? asked the old chief, sternly.
Let the young warriors be silent, while they have chiefs on the same
war-path. We have eaten of the white fathers bread, and he has
ordered us here to await his messenger. Black Fox will stay.

As he spoke, he leaned his rifle against the tree by which he stood,
drew up his blanket around his shoulders, and took his seat in
dignified silence.

The other warriors, as if determined by his example, proceeded to make
their dispositions for the night. A flint and steel were produced,
tinder was found in a dead tree, and a small glowing fire was soon
started, around which the Indians clustered, eating their frugal meal
of dried venison and parched corn in silence.

These Indians were a small scouting party from the flankers of
Burgoynes army, who had been dispatched through the woods to the west
of Albany, to meet an emissary of the British Government, who was to
give them certain instructions.

Slowly the sun disappeared as they clustered round the fire, and the
crimson glow died away in the sky, to be replaced by a murky mass of
cloud of dark slaty gray, rapidly becoming black. Overhead the stars
shone out, but the clouds began to gather and hide them from view, and
a low moaning in the tops of the trees warned the hearers of a storm
brewing.

Suddenly, as if by common consent, every Indian sprung to his feet,
and grasped his weapons, as the sound of snapping sticks, and of
horse-hoofs in rapid motion, approached the spot. There was no
underbrush in those primeval forests, as yet innocent of the ax of
the woodman, and a horseman could be seen in full career, rapidly
approaching the little glade.

At a word from the chief, the four warriors resumed their seats by the
fire, while the old leader himself stalked forth from the group, and
drawing himself up, awaited the coming of the stranger, in an attitude
of dignity, grounding the butt of his rifle.

The new-comer proved to be a man of large size, with a stern,
determined face, gloomy and lowering in expression. He was dressed like
a farmer, and well mounted on a stout horse, carrying holsters on the
saddle, from which peeped the butts of large pistols. Otherwise the
rider was unarmed, only carrying a horse-whip. He checked his horse,
and dismounted before Black Fox, who addressed him with the grave
reminder:

The Night Hawk is late.

I couldnt be earlier, Fox, returned the other, in the Mohawk tongue.
I was fired at by Schuylers pickets, and chased out of my path by a
patrol of the cursed mounted rifles of that fellow, Morgan. Here I am
at last. Go back to the General, and let him know that the rebels are
rousing everywhere. Schuyler has sent orders to rescue the fort beyond
Oriskany at any cost, and they will march in two days from now, a
thousand strong, under General Herkimer, to raise the siege. Have you a
swift runner here?

The Panther Cub has long legs. He shall carry the Night Walkers
words, said the chief, sententiously.
