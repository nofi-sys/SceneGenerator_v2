SCENE:
Mrs. Trimwell approached a step nearer. She lowered her voice to a
confidential whisper.

Twas that day to the minute, sir, as my uncle died.

Ah! Johns eyes, non-committal in expression, sought the window.
Corin cast a look of scorn at him; then turned, eager, to Mrs. Trimwell.

Did you tell the Vicar that? he demanded.

I did, sir, replied Mrs. Trimwell, including him for the first time
within her range of vision. But, Lor, wheres the use of telling
things to he! He dont understand no more than a Bishop.

Why a Bishop? thought John in parenthesis.

When my Tilda was down with pneumony, pursued Mrs. Trimwell
reminiscent, and the doctor said there wasnt no chance for her, Ill
see about chances, says I. Vicar, he talked about the Will of the Lord
and submitting. Its not the minute to be talking about submitting
yet, says I to him. The Lord may do the willing, and Im not one to
deny it, but tis we do the doing, and it kind of fits in. And if you
think Im going to leave off fighting for my Tilda till the time comes
as shes ready to lay out, youre much mistook. He was mistook, sir,
for shes in the kitchen now a-minding of the baby. She ended on a
note gloriously triumphant.

The triumph found quick response in Johns eyes. I fancy he saw here
reflected the attitude of that old-time king, who strove in prayer for
his child, till striving and prayer were no longer of avail.

The fighting chance, murmured Corin, swallowing his last mouthful of
sole.

Mrs. Trimwell removed the plates and placed cold chicken and salad on
the table.

In a manner of speaking it was, said she, eyeing him with approval.
She moved towards the door, then turned.

You will take coffee after lunch? she asked.

John looked his assent, yet left it to Corin, as in a manner host, to
give verbal reply to the query.

By all means, replied Corin. I need, he assured her, every atom of
support at your avail.

Mrs. Trimwell looked at him commiseratingly.

Ill be bound its hard work down there, said she sympathetically.
How do you find it, sir?

Interesting, returned Corin, distinctly interesting. I feel like an
explorer of bygone centuries penetrating through modern hideousity,
early Victorian crudeness, Puritan dreariness, and various other
glooms, to the sweet, kindly simplicity, the grace, the freshness, the
love of beauty, appertaining to the olden days. I am, concluded Corin,
helping himself to salad, crumbling to pieces that which has hidden
beauty, and exposing beauty to the light of day. In other words, Im
scraping the plaster off the walls of the church, and enjoying myself.

Mrs. Trimwell nodded, frank approbation plainly visible on her face.

And time it was scraped, too. A mucky looking place it was with them
walls all stained and chipped and mildewed. Not that it hurt me much,
seeing as I never go inside it, except its for a christening or a
burial.

Oh! remarked Corin, and somewhat feebly, be it stated.

John cast a whimsical look in his direction.

I dont hold with church-going, pursued Mrs. Trimwell calmly. Say
your prayers at home if you want to say them, says I. And as for
sermons,--if youve heard Vicar talk out of the pulpit whether you will
or no, you dont run off smiling to hear him talk in it. Leastways I
dont. Theres some as does, I know.

Oh! said Corin again, and this time more feebly. (John, I fear me,
was laughing inwardly.) To disagree with Mrs. Trimwell would, Corin
felt, be tantamount to calling her a black kettle, setting up himself
the while as a shiny brass pot, to which title he knew he possessed no
manner of right. Yet to agree!--Well, Corins conscience, some hidden
fragment of convention--call it what you will--felt a slight hint of
repugnance at her sentiments.

There is your man, your male individual, all over. Dogmatic
religion--however vague the dogma--church-going is often outside his
own category, yet for his women folk--any women folk--to speak against
it holds for him a hint of distaste. It just serves to destroy that
soft light of idealism with which he loves to surround women. Every man
has one woman, at least, in this idealistic shrine, or, if he has not,
he is of all men most miserable. And here it is that your adherents
to the old Faith--the oldest Faith in Christendom--have a pull over
your so-called enlightened individual. There is always One Woman to
whom those of that old Faith can turn, one for whom no shrine is too
fair, too lofty,--can be bedecked with no too costly wealth of love and
homage. Here, in this shrine, at her feet, may every idealistic thought
of man towards woman be placed, preserved, and cherished.
