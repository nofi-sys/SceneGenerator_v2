Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Aside from this active scene, everything was quiet. Farther down the
Court, doves had settled; were pink-toeing about feeding busily;
preening and cooing.

Sometimes, Laura said thoughtfully, I feel as though I had dreamed
Maida. If the Little Shop were not here with her name over the door and
all of you to talk about her with me, I should believe I had just waked
up. She stopped a moment. If it had been a dream how mad I should be
to think I _had_ waked up.

Do you remember how exciting it was when Maida first came to live over
the Little Shop? Rosie exclaimed.

I should say I did! It was Laura who answered her. Wasnt it
wonderful when all that pretty furniture came for their rooms?

Yes, and the canaries and the great geraniums for the windows, Rosie
added eagerly.

The most wonderful thing though, Arthur went on, was when the sign
went up. It was such a pretty sign--MAIDAS LITTLE SHOP in gold painted
on blue. And--

Gee, how wild we all were to see Maida! Harold said.

I dont know what I expected, Rosies voice was dreamy, but I
certainly was surprised when Maida appeared--

Lame, Arthur concluded for her, like Dicky. But theyre both all
right now. Dicky certainly is and Maida was when she left for Europe.

I often think, Harold began again after a little pause, of when we
first met her and she used to talk of the things her father gave her,
we thought she was telling lies.

I never thought she was telling lies, Rosie expostulated. I loved
her too much for that. I knew Maida wouldnt tell lies. I thought shed
just dreamed those things. I remember them all--her mothers mirror and
brush and comb of gold with her initials in diamonds.... And the long
string of pearls that she used to wear that came to her knees.... And a
dress of cloth of gold trimmed with roses and a diamond, like a drop of
dew, in the heart of every rose.

Yes, and the peacocks at her fathers place, some of them white,
Arthur interrupted.

And dont you remember, Harold went on, we all thought she was crazy
when she said that once he gave her for a birthday present her weight
in twenty-dollar gold-pieces.

And a wonderful birthday party, Laura added eagerly, with a Maypole
and a doll-baby house big enough to go into and live--

I dont wonder we didnt believe it all, Rosie declared with
conviction, It sounds like a fairy tale. And then it turned out that
she was the daughter of a great millionaire and _every word_ of it was
true. Do you remember how we asked Mr. Westabrook at Maidas Christmas
tree if it was all true and he said that it was?

Id like to see those white peacocks, Dicky said dreamily.

Id like to see that doll-baby house, Laura added wistfully.

Id like to see the gold comb and brush and mirror with the
diamonds, Rosie declared, and that dress with the roses and the
diamond dew-drops. I like to look at precious stones. I like things
that sparkle.

At this thought, she herself sparkled until her eyes were like great
black diamonds in her vivid brilliant face.

Id like to see that pile of twenty-dollar gold-pieces, Harold said.

Oh I wish shed come back, Rosie sighed. The sparkle all went out of
her face and she stopped swinging.

A door leading into Primrose Court opened with a suddenness that made
them all jump. A boy with big eyes, very brown and lustrous, lighting
his peaked face and straight hair very brown and lustrous, framing it,
came bounding out. He ran in the direction of the group on the lawn,
and as he ran he waved something white in his hand. The doves flew away
before him in a glittering V. Hurrah! he yelled.

Gee, how Dicky can run! Arthur Duncan exclaimed. Whod ever believed
that one year ago, he was wearing an iron on his leg? He--

Oh what is it, Dicky? Rosie Brine called impatiently.

Dicky had by this time reached the Lathrop gate.
