SCENE:
XXV

THE ROUND-UP


The first stars were peeping from a cloud-strewn sky when Roy and
Teddy rode into the yards of the X Bar X. Without waiting to tie up
their horses, they rushed into the house. Mrs. Manley was talking to
Norine in the living room.

Mother! Teddy exclaimed, wheres dad? Is he in?

Just went toward the corral, Teddy, Mrs. Manley answered. Then, as
she saw Teddys face, she asked: What happened? Is Belle all right?
She didnt--

Nothing like that at all, Mom! Roy cried, giving her a quick hug.
Weve got good news. We know where our horses are!

Do you, now? Norine broke in, her eyes alight. Then Im glad! I
missed those ponies, so I did!

Youd better hurry after your father, Mrs. Manley admonished.
Hes riding again tonight after the rustlers. I do wish this were
over!

It will be soon, Mom! declared Teddy, Dont worry now--well have
that gang before morning!

But, boys, youre all wet! You really must get some dry clothes
on!

When we find dad, Mom! Want to reach him before he leaves! Come on,
Teddy!

The boys rushed from the room. Mrs. Manley turned to Norine with
something very much akin to pride in her eyes. Her boys were already
men!

Teddy reached his father just as the ranchman was throwing a saddle
on a bronco. The boys told their story quickly.

tonight, hey? Mr. Manley pondered. Well, sons, you sure did a
fine piece of work. Now for the round-up of those rustlers! Teddy,
go to the bunk-house and tell the boys to get over here, pronto!
Tell em to bring guns! Then you an Roy get some food in you an
some dry clothes on. This is the last act, boys! We ring the curtain
down on that gang tonight!

Later, a small crowd of men sat on restless horses. From each belt
hung a heavy revolver, and in more than a few saddlecases reposed
long-barreled rifles. Nick Looker was there, and Pop Burns and Gus
Tripp, now recovered, and Jim Casey, and four other punchers. Teddy
and Roy were on either side of their father.

Boys, Mr. Manley called, were set! To the north fence--and dont
make any noise! When you get there lay low. Keep your broncs still.
When I see the rustlers Ill fire one shot--then close in, an close
in quick! Understand? Then lets go!

There was a clatter of hoofs as the horses galloped over the ground.
During that ride hardly a word was spoken. Then the wait began. Time
seemed to stand still. The shadowy clouds disappeared, and the moon
shone forth, silhouetting the group of watching punchers. A breeze
sighed through the branches of a small grove of evergreens. Now and
then a pony whinnied nervously, to be instantly quieted by a firm
hand on his nostrils.

Snakes, this is like waitin for an explosion when yore sittin on
top of th dynamite! whispered Pop, who was close to Roy. If
somethin dont happen soon--

Roy raised his hand. From the west seven riders came flashing over
the moon-flooded prairie, straight for the fence. The leader leaped
from his horse and, pulling something from his pocket, rested his
hand on the top wire. There was a sharp crack as the strand parted.

A single shot rang out. Then a yell.

Get em, boys! Roy shouted. Theyre our meat! Get the one with
the pliers in his hand--thats Froud!

Ponies sprang forward. Guns leaped from holsters and were leveled at
the astounded rustlers. Three of the latter turned in a flash and
rode off like the wind, rifles cracking them a farewell.

The man on foot looked about him desperately. In the moonlight the
scar on his face seemed like a small, silver snake crawling up his
face. He saw himself being surrounded by determined cowboys with
murderous guns in their hands.
