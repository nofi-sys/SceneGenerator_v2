SCENE:
Liane spoke to him simply, plainly, and like a man. The awe of her
exquisite manner fell away. She no longer seemed to Jean like a
mysterious and potent being from another world; but he had no time to
regret the destruction of his illusion. For the first time in his life
he was talking to a real comrade. Bliss had come out of solitude, and
submitted joyously to the reinforcement of humanity. The names of great
musicians flashed between them. Liane flung her experiences into his
hands and drew out of him in return his ambitions and desires; these at
present, it seemed, did not include retirement into a monastery or the
rules of the Third Order.

You are one of the emotional players, she said to him. Not the
great, broad interpreters who give you the picked bones of a musicians
work--but one of their own brothers, who fire you afresh with their
laughter and their tears. You will play Chopin most, I fancy. Schumann
and Grieg, and the Russian men--our French moderns too, of course,
Debussy above all; for there is so much dream in you--but Cartier wont
let you specialize yet. What hell give you is Bach and Mozart; hell
stuff it into you by the yard. You must meet some singers, too, and
play for them. Often one must begin this way.

In the middle of their talk the door opened and Maurice Golaud
stood there, tired and wet from the _courses_, but looking at them
nevertheless with curious amusement in his eyes.

Jean stood up half embarrassed, with the burden of his youth upon him,
and as he did so he saw Lianes face change; it was as if she had
covered herself subtly and suddenly with a veil of intangible gauze,
the artist had retreated once more. She was the beautiful woman with
the lure in her eyes. Her lips parted, and a glance ran between her and
Maurice which seemed to Jean like quick flame. The smile in Maurices
eyes deepened.

Ah, you have found us at last, _mon ami_? Maurice said to Jean. For
my part, I was fancying you must have picked up some pretty amusements
elsewhere, since you have been in Paris nearly a month before looking
us up. You should have been at the _courses_ this afternoon; it was
really not half bad. No, it wouldnt have amused you, _ma chrie_, no
one was killed and no one was ruined, and the ladies clothes looked
_passs_ in the rain. You really did better for yourself remaining
here, and entertaining my dear old Jean.

Liane smiled, but she did not say anything. She no longer looked at
Jean.

He got up to go; they both of them urged him to remain, though Maurice
went to the door with him in a bland cordiality of farewell.

Well, and now you have found your way here you must come often, he
said. I can see already that Liane likes you.

It was not easy for Jean to explain to Maurice about his vocation now,
but Maurice was, after all, only another man, and Jean was not a coward.

This is not the kind of life I have been living, he began lamely.
You see, Maurice, I am bound to say so, I dont like the--the ways of
Paris.

No? said Maurice cheerfully. Well, that is a pity! Still, if you
have been leading a dull life and not mixing with clever people like
ourselves--one understands. We must alter all that, you know; Ill talk
to Liane about it. _Au revoir_, Jean.

The rain had stopped, and for the first time Jean discovered a charm
in the streets of Paris. There was something mysterious and beautiful
in the air to-night. The faces of the women in the crowd seemed as
fresh as summer flowers, the lights along the Seine wound their way
into the heart of the city like a string of fallen stars.

Jean held his head up as he walked; he felt an indefinable sense of
youth and vigour in his veins.

He noticed that one or two of the women as he passed looked at him; and
he no longer felt like a ghost.

After dinner he went back to his rooms, but he could not stay there. He
was dissatisfied with himself and he did not want to think. He went to
the window and looked out. It was ten oclock; if he was going to early
Mass to-morrow as usual, he had better go to bed.

_La Fin de lAmour_ was on at the Odon. Jean had never been to the
Odon, but he knew where it was. If he went at once he would be in time
to see Liane in the last act.

After all, he had decided nothing, he had taken no vows. How wrong it
was of the old Confessor not to let him join the Third Order! If he
were living under rule now--then for one moment Jean faced his own
soul and would not lie to himself. If I were living under rule now,
he said beneath his breath, I should break the rule. After that he
thought no more about the higher life.
