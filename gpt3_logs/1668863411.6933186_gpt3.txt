SCENE:
It takes time to settle in, ventured Margot, looking up from her
ironing.

Of course, if you do not wish for one, began Jean with great dignity.

But I do! cried Margot with immense eagerness and no dignity at all.

You might, then, said Jean reproachfully have said so before.

Margot hung her head penitently and began to fold up the tablecloth;
she hadnt finished it, but she saw Jean was not in the mood to be kept
waiting.

I think you had better bring your music to my room, he said, after a
pause. We might disturb your mother.

Margot flushed. She had not expected Jean to like her mother, but she
had hoped that she would not have to see quite so plainly how much he
didnt.

Very well, she said simply. She was dressed neatly and prettily, as
she always was, and her hair curled over her fresh white forehead;
her cheeks were a little less rosy and round, and her eyes looked
larger--but this was becoming to her rather than otherwise, and it was
perhaps unnecessary for Jean to compare her mentally to Liane, wholly
to Margots disadvantage.

The truth was that Jean wished to be fascinated by women, not to be
mothered by them, and though Margot did try very hard to please him,
she did so intermittently and without calculation, because the desire
of her heart was to do and be what was best for him; and that was
hardly the kind of thing that a man of Jeans age could be expected to
appreciate. Even as Margot followed him into his room her whole being
was absorbed in the consideration of how to cook eggs _ laurore_ for
djeuner. It was Friday, and Jean had said he hated plain eggs. For
three days she had been on tip-toe with desire and expectation for this
lesson, and now she was hopelessly absorbed in eggs! She looked at Jean
with unintelligent eyes; tomato sauce was so expensive, would not a
dash of vinegar in thick brown gravy do as well?

Mademoiselle, said Jean, with awful calm, is this what you call your
music?

_O ciel!_ cried Margot in horror, throwing her hands above her head.
It was the cookery book; they neither of them laughed!

When she returned with her songs, Jean took out a cigarette and looked
through them with critical eyes.

Bah! he exclaimed. Havent you anything better than these?

Margot had, after all, some spirit; she did not like Jeans tone of
contempt, and she thought he should have asked her leave to smoke. She
was far more particular about such things than Liane.

Music is not very cheap, Monsieur, she said, a little sharply. Jean
shrugged his shoulders.

Good music is, however, cheaper than bad, he said indifferently.

Not unless you are paid to sing it, replied Margot, with admirable
common sense. Common sense is a quality all women who desire to please
should learn to avoid, or at least conceal; they may use it in their
private judgments, but it should never be allowed to appear in their
conversation. It annoyed Jean extremely.

_Allons!_ he said; _commencez donc!_ And he pushed all the music on
to the floor and began to play scales.

Margot was disappointed, she did not wish to sing scales; her mind
returned to the eggs. Did he, she wondered, like them lightly cooked?

Mademoiselle, said Jean turning round on the music-stool. What are
you doing with these notes?

Margot blushed guiltily.

A note, said Jean severely, has a middle, a beginning, and an
end. It is not a ghost, that you can run over it without disaster.
Strike the middle of the note with your full voice, I entreat; you
are fumbling and creeping up to it, and then when I expect it to come
out--_voil!_--you have swallowed it completely, there is nothing left
to come. Try these arpeggios now. _Attendez!_

Margot shut her eyes and drew frowning brows together to show how hard
she was trying. Jean looked very cross this morning. He had not slept
well and his conscience had worn his nerves to threads; having done the
best he could, he felt terribly guilty and disheartened.

That is better, said Jean; but it is not good; one would say your
voice was wool-gathering this morning! Now try these chords.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Margot and Jean, and to set up the conflict between them. Margot is presented as a well-meaning but somewhat ditzy young woman, while Jean is shown to be a talented but temperamental musician. The scene also establishes the setting and establishes the tone of the story, which appears to be a light-hearted comedy.
