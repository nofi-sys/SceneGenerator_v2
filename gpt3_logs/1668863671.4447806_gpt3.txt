SCENE:
Now I think, he said with a good-natured smile, that this is
really capital of Flaubert, dear old man! he has such a head on his
shoulders! I should never get on without him. Dont you think he has
done all this very well? I assure you I cant think how he manages
it--those flowers now--Gabrielle and I couldnt run to orchids like
this! I dont believe Paris held them all; they tell me he wired to
London; did you ever hear of such a man? Youll sing for him to-night,
wont you, Salvi?

La Salvi ate another pink cake before she answered. Flaubert was
receiving Hester Lvi; for her, too, he went half way downstairs; she
was the richest woman in Paris.

No, said Salvi at length. I have a cold in my head, I think, or the
bubonic plague, or perhaps the cholera; one never knows the beginning
of those things. Why should I sing? I am not a gramophone to be turned
on and off at everybodys garden party! Why dont you sing yourself,
then, if you want so to please him?

I? Oh well, you know, Im an old man now, said Torialli, rather
sadly. When one has sung, as I have sung, one does not come up after
the resurrection. It is better to stay dead, my dear Salvi--its better
to stay dead!

Well, for my part, said Salvi, taking up a green cake instead of a
pink one, I think it better not to die, so I take things very easily
and in half an hour I go to bed. Is that the Duchesse de Richemont
talking to your wife; because, if it is, bring her over to me; shes a
young woman, and she hasnt eaten so many cakes, so she may as well do
the moving! Thank you, Torialli, youre a good fellow!

Torialli was a very good fellow, and he proved it in more ways than
one; when he had given his dear Salvi the young duchesse for her
companion he did his best to brighten up the waiting _soire_.

Still there it was! It would wait. It was waiting to hear La Salvi,
and when the element of suspense has been introduced into pleasure the
pleasure recedes before it like the ebb of a relentless tide. In vain
Torialli moved everywhere with his friendly compliments to Flaubert and
his good-tempered laughter; in vain Madame Torialli, always tactful,
always serene, glided about among the guests, leaving behind her a wake
of gratified smiles and purring _amour propre_. The evening dragged
and people waited. The princes sent a message in from the theatre to
ask when La Salvi was coming out, or were they to come in to hear her?
because if they were, they would have to take off their tights, which
would be really too many kinds of a picturesque nuisance; but at any
rate something must be done promptly or they would be bored.

Flaubert took his courage in both hands and approached La Salvi. La
Salvi went on talking to the Duchesse de Richemont and did not appear
to see him coming. When he had reached her a hush came over the two
drawing-rooms. Madame Salvi looked up and smiled.

What! she said. Has Aladdin a new surprise for us?

My dear Madame, said poor Flaubert, do not talk as if I could work
a miracle when I come to ask for one. You will take away the little
courage I have if you do that!

You have enough, interrupted Salvi softly. Rest assured, Monsieur
Flaubert, I think you have enough!

Madame, will you do me the infinite honour, will, you make me the
happiest of men, and sing for us to-night? Flaubert persevered
waveringly, though he felt the conviction ebbing out of his voice. Ah!
he had said it at last; the perspiration broke out on his forehead, he
felt, as he afterwards expressed it, as if white ants were eating his
spine!

But I am shocked! I am desolated! cried Madame Salvi. To disappoint
you is a horror to me! But was it what you expected, that I should sing
to-night?

I do not dare to say _expected_, Madame, murmured the wretched
Flaubert. But I had humbly hoped----

Ah well! if you did not expect it, said Salvi. So much the better!
Still I regret to have to take away your humble hopes. Wednesday, I
sing for our dear Torialli; I must preserve my poor little efforts till
then.

Ah, Madame! pleaded Flaubert. Just one song, your magnificent
organ----

My dear good Flaubert, impossible! said Salvi, slowly rising. I have
eaten six cakes, the duchesse is a witness, in the last ten minutes. I
never eat before I sing, only afterwards. Consider, then, that I have
sung. And now, my good friend, I must really go. My glass slipper has
begun to pinch in such a manner that I am sure in five minutes it will
be off. A thousand thanks for the entertainment of a life-time. I do
not readily forget such attentions as yours, my dear Flaubert. Tell our
good princes I would have given much to see their costumes and to hear
them sing, of course! Their parts must be ravishing! So clever of you
to have an entertainment in the garden. And La Salvi was gone.
