Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Two or three pleasant words quickly reassured him. He condescended to
confide to me that he was at a decisive moment in his experiments and
that the next day, without doubt, perhaps that very night.... Through
the open door came the noise of his furnaces, roaring like chimneys on
fire.

I thought it unwise to tell him that I, too, had reached the same stage
as himself in another affair. Besides, almost at once he put away his
books, folded up his notes, rubbed out his formul, wished me good-night
and went.

I was eager for his departure as I had already found what I wanted.

With a sureness of method which astonished me I had put my hand straight
off on the vital document, a bill of Giroud's, dated 1682, and addressed
to Ernest-Augustus.

It was a long bill, but I found the following item at once:


For the chimney-place of the Baron's Hall, six springs, in
my name, at one hundred and fifty livres the spring.--Total
900 livres.


I did not need to have a very profound knowledge of secret springs and
locks to know what it meant. The system is still used in safes, Fichet's
and others. It meant that on the fire-back of the chimney-place in the
Baron's Hall of the _Herrenhausen_ there were six lettered locks. You
made the spring act by taking for each lock in turn one of the six
letters forming the name of the inventor, Giroud.

When you remember that this Giroud was the master-locksmith of the Grand
Duke of Lautenburg you won't have much difficulty in realizing that my
first thought was to use the fire-back in the armoury of the castle of
Lautenburg as a test of the accuracy of my reasoning with regard to the
fireplace of the Baron's Hall in the Castle of Hanover. So you may
imagine how impatiently I watched Cyrus Beck's departure.

When at last he had gone I waited a quarter of an hour. Then I turned
out the lights, opened the right-hand door of the library and banged it
to as if I had gone back to my room. Then, taking great care not to fall
over anything and picking my way among the desks and show-cases I
returned and cautiously opened the door on the left hand side which led
into the armoury.

Great pools of moonlight, shaped like the tall lancet windows, flecked
the dark floor. I went straight to the chimney-place. I started at
touching the heavy iron fire-back. It was only when my fingers found a
kind of knob high up on the left that I switched on my electric torch.

I had no difficulty in dealing with the knob. It pivoted on a hinge,
revealing a kind of dial. The whole thing was not unlike one of our
gas-metres.

I started back in dismay. I was expecting letters, but this dial had
numbers. It was divided into twenty-five sections.

Turning off the lamp I sat down on a heavy oak stool close by.

I didn't have to think long. 25! What a fool I was!

I pulled out a pencil and a piece of paper, turned on the lamp again
and, kneeling at the stool, I had soon written out the twenty-five
letters of the alphabet and underneath a row of figures to correspond.
Then I wrote Giroud's name and obtained the following combination: 7, 9,
18, 15, 21, 4.

791815214. It will be a long time before I forget that number.

I examined the whole face of the metal rectangle with my lamp. A
terrible disappointment was in store for me. Instead of the six knobs
that I had _expected_ I could only find two.

When a single factor throws out the kind of calculations I had just made
it can only mean that one's theory is radically false. I might have
known. That would have been much too simple....

Solely to prove myself wrong, I tried the first knob and turning the
pointer on the dial I set it on the figure 7--g.

I crossed to the other side and repeated the operation on the other
knob, putting the pointer on the figure 9--i.

All at once I could hear my heart beat. A black vertical line appeared
in the centre of the plaque. That line got wider and wider. The two
panels thus formed slid back to each side, leaving a gap some two feet
six inches wide.

I was on the right track. The mystery of the _Herrenhausen_ was to be
solved at last!

The protagonist realizes that the same system is likely used in the armoury of the castle of Lautenburg, and decides to test his theory. He goes to the armoury and finds the chimney-place, but is disappointed to see that there are only two locks, not six.
He tries the first lock, and to his amazement, it opens. He tries the second lock, and it also opens. A black vertical line appears in the centre of the plaque, and the two panels slide back to reveal a hidden passage.
