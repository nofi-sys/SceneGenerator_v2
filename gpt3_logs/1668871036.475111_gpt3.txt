SCENE:
Ill go round and bruise up yer father, said he. Ill talk to him
like a Dutch uncle, I will. Him and the two old onesll play light on
the ghost game when I get through. Theyll see it aint no use. Take a
walk with Jimmie, Rosie; dont go home till youse tink Ive left. Ill
make it right, all right!

But this was not the only incident of the morning. Annie Clancy stood
in the door of the grocery store; and as Goose McGonagle came along
he naturally stopped for a chat. The voice of Clancy could be heard
grumbling from the interior.

Whats the matter with yer father? asked Goose.

Dont talk too loud, warned Annie, with uplifted finger, he might
hear ye. Hes been in an awful temper ever since his half sister, old
Miss Cassidy, died. They say she left her money to the Church. He
thought hed git it, and then hed be able to pay--you know what.

The milkman nodded.

I ought to, answered he, I cant tink o the mess Im in meself
without tinkin o that. But his temper dont cut no ice with me,
Annie, Im goin to talk to him to-day if I git trun down or not.

Annie! called Clancy, angrily. Sure, what keeps yez glosterin be
the dure? Come in at wanst, an tind till yez bit av wurk.

He knows Im here, smiled Goose.

I must go in, whispered Annie, good-by.

Goose started up the street upon his round, muttering:

Clancy aint so many, if he does run a grocery store. Annies willin
to call it a go, an I dont see--Gee! Here comes OHara.

The second-hand dealer had just come out of his shop; he wore his
narrow-rimmed high hat and carried his thick black-thorn cane.

Good mornin till yez, McGonagle, saluted he.

How are youse? responded Goose.

I have no rayson till complain, said OHara. Then he tapped his stick
once or twice upon the pavement, and cleared his throat. McGonagle,
said he, yez will be after havin the troifle av money thats due me
nixt week?

Why, say, OHara, ttell youse the trut I dont see how I kin git it.
Bizness is so rotten bad, ye know.

Whats that? Bad luck till ye, McGonagle, what talk have yez?

Dont git hot! Youse heard me speak me piece, didnt ye? Well, thats
jist what I mean. An I cant stand chewin it with youse all day,
OHara; me customersll be waitin for their milk. So long.

And with this he hurried off while OHara gazed angrily after him for
a moment, then started off toward Clancys.

The blagard! muttered OHara. The thafe av the world till keep a
daysint man out av his bit av money!

He entered Clancys and found the grocer alone, seated astride a crate,
sorting eggs.

The top av the mornin till yez, Clancy, said OHara, politely.

The same till yezsilf, responded Clancy. Sure, an its glad till
see yez I am, this foine mornin. Then under his breath he added: God
forgime for the lie Im tellin.

Ive jist luked in till ask if yez have the troifle av money thats
due me, said OHara.

I have not the price av a can av beer in the house. Faix an Ive jist

claned out I am, entirely.

Mister Clancy, I will have me money, principal an intrust, or I will

on yez. Mister Clancy, good day till yez, sir! And he slammed the door
behind him.
