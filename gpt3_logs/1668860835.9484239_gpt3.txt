SCENE:
Day is coming, Mr. Dunton; I think theres a slight break in the gale.

And so it seemed. There was a perceptible lessening of the schooners
motion and Dunton felt relieved.

Suddenly a shout that the cable had parted arose and for some time the
utmost confusion prevailed. The vessel fell off before the wind which
had shifted a point to the north.

Our only chance is to run for it, Mr. Dunton, cried Hoppy. I think
we had better make for the inlet, though it must be shallow water on
the outer bar now!

The storm jib was set and the schooner plunged forward, Hoppy at the
wheel. It was now sufficiently clear to distinguish the shore. The
appearance of the sky denoted a change near though the gale was still
strong.

Hoppy held her head in the direction of what he called the inlet. It
could not be much of an inlet, was Duntons thought, for as far as
the eye could range along shore there was nothing but a stretch of
surf-beaten beach.

Not much of a harbor, Mayo?

You will see it better in a short time, Mr. Dunton.

Onward raced the schooner and the sea was surely getting smoother as
she approached the land. When about half a mile from it, Hoppy ran her
right into the winds eye and with a shock the little craft stood still.

Whats that for, Mayo? demanded Dunton suspiciously.

It means, Mr. Dunton, replied Hoppy coolly, that we are aground on
the outer bar.

Then what are we going to do now?

We were a bit too late to catch enough water for crossing. We must now
wait for the next tide to enable us to get off.

But whats going to happen meanwhile?

The schooner will be all right where she is, replied the pilot.
However, I should advise you to send your men below, Mr. Dunton, so
that the people on shore may not get suspicious at seeing such a large
crew.

As the vessel was stuck fast in the sand there seemed no alternative
but to follow Hoppys advice; so, reluctantly, Dunton ordered the men
below. Hoppy caught Jacksons eye and that worthy winked significantly.
The convivial tar waved his hand in salute as he followed his mates
below. Dunton and his two subordinate officers remained on deck with
the pilot.

The storm was almost over and the British commander cursed his bad luck
in not having been able to hold on to his anchor. Here, he was in a bad
predicament, held fast on the treacherous flats and obliged to wait
for hours until the flood tide floated the schooner. The hated Yankees
ashore would soon discover his plight and, perhaps, muster sufficient
force to seize his vessel, making prisoners of all on board. The gloomy
prospect affected Duntons nerves and he longed to vent his spleen on
the pilot, but he had no evidence whatever that the latter had not
acted in good faith.

As the daylight got stronger a few men were observed on the beach.
Hoppy knew that they were the forerunners of the crowd which would soon
be on the scene.

The tide was ebbing fast and the schooner would soon be high and dry
on the flats. Then the pilot must strike the final blow on which he
depended for victory. He was not afraid of the result. There had been
no setback to his plans up to the present and he felt confident that
within the hour Dunton and his men would be prisoners of war.

The schooner, feeling the want of the supporting tide, heeled over.
Dunton on the quarterdeck was dividing his attention between the
increasing crowd on the beach and the movements of the pilot. The
latter seemed to be examining the brass four pounder with great
curiosity. To Dunton it looked as if Hoppy had it in his mind to train
the piece on the beach, but that idea vanished quickly when he saw the
bold Cape Codder deliberately spike the gun!

Treason, by G----! he shouted as he made a rush forward. Hoppy gave
the spike a clinching blow and turned on the officer.

Stand back there, Dunton! he cried fiercely. Stand back there! and
keep a civil tongue in your mouth, you d--d swab!

Hoppy had snatched a boarding pike from the rack and Dunton paused
irresolutely before the weapon.
