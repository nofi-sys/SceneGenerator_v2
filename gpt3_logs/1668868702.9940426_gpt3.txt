Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
He was just about to lunch at his hotel, when a negro waiter, who seemed
impressed by something, came to tell him, chiefly by signs, that he was
wanted in the foyer. Wondering what he could have done wrong, or what
could cause the negros manner, he went out to the foyer, where a
footman, in a green and white livery, very politely told him, in Spanish
and pantomime, that there was something very important for him,
seemingly outside the doors. Looking as the footmans signs directed, he
saw an old carriage, in which two ladies sat, beneath green parasols.
Rosa, he thought, Rosa and her mother.

One of the ladies was old, with white hair; she sat upright with an
absorbed look as though she were praying. The other was Rosa, but
changed indeed from the Rosa of the Foliats; this creature was painted
into a kind of purple mask with high lights of white powder on her nose.
Over her eyes, arches of plainly false eyebrows had been put in with the
brow-stick. Great gold ear-rings, enclosing green stones, hung from her
ears, her mouth was scarlet. He had never seen a more raddled-looking
baggage, yet this was the Rosa of four months before, who had galloped
hatless astraddle before breakfast with him. Both ladies turned to him
at once with an air which made him feel ashamed that he had no hat to
take off to them and very thankful that he hadnt. The old lady was more
subtly made up than her daughter, but even she seemed to wear a mask or
glaze of enamel. I suppose its the fashion here, he thought.

Glaze or not, they were plainly great ladies here, conferring incredible
honour upon the hotel. Half the staff was there to attend their pleasure
already. The Seora held her hand for Hi to kiss (his good angel guarded
him from shaking it), she bade him welcome in English. He had not seen
her since he was a little child, but he remembered her clearly, as Donna
Emilia, a lady who held herself very straight and was always praying.
She needed not to have made up, Hi thought. There is something very
beautiful in her face.

Welcome, she said; your father has been a good friend to us. You and
yours have been good friends to Rosa. I hope that all your household was
well when you left England. Let me see you, Highworth. You are liker
your mother than your father. But my eyes are failing, I cannot be sure
of this. Come now, with us, will you, to spend some hours at our house?

I should love to, Hi said.

Go and get your hat, then, and put it on, Rosa said. Never, never
come out without a hat again. Put it on at once, or this sun will skin
you. It doesnt come through a watery envelope as it does in England.
That is your vanity, wanting to look brown. You wouldnt look brown,
youd crack, and all your poor little brains would pop.

They drove down the water-front, past the Viceroys garden, to the gate.
Several houses on the water-front were displaying the scarlet banners,
starred with gold, which Lopez had declared to be the national flag.

Is there to be some sort of celebration? Hi asked.

A display, I understand, Donna Emilia said.

How wonderful the bay looks with the shipping, Rosa said quickly. Do
you see, Hi, the shallows beyond the bay? All that southern bay is only
about six feet deep.

Good bathing, I should think, Hi said. Is one allowed to bathe
there?

I believe that some of the Indians sometimes bathe there, Rosa said,
but there are swarms of sharks. If you go out in a boat, theyll come
all round you, and rub along the side and try to tip you out.

What do you do then? Hi asked. Sing them to sleep?

The best way is to hit them a bat with the flat of an oar-blade.

I wonder you dont stare at them, Hi said. No shark can resist the
power of the human eye.

Womens eyes excite them, Rosa said.

I should have thought a haughty look would shrivel them. The books are
full of it: She darted a freezing glance at him.

At this moment they were passing through the gate of the city. On their
right was a park of palms, flowers and busts, on their left, beyond the
fortress, was the approach to the market pier, where the boats landed
fish, fruit and other produce at dawn each morning. A party of men and
women were coming from this pier with donkey carts laden with fruits,
eggs and vegetables. Theyre the second market, Rosa said, they buy
up the leavings from the boats and hawk them through the closes.

The men of the second market recognised the liveries of the Piranhas.
They stopped their carts, stood still, uncovered and cried, Long live
the Whites. Long live the Whites. Let the Reds perish. To His
astonishment neither woman took the slightest notice. They stared ahead
as though they neither saw nor heard. Hi thought it odd that they did
not bow; Rosa turned to him.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

A waiter tells the protagonist that he is wanted in the foyer, where he finds two ladies in a carriage. He recognizes one as Rosa, but she is greatly changed from the last time he saw her. The ladies invite him to spend the afternoon with them, and he agrees. As they drive through the city, they pass a park and the market pier, where a group of people recognize the ladies' liveries and cry out their support for the "Whites." Rosa and her mother do not acknowledge them.
