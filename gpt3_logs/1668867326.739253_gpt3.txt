SCENE:
Jack will be back from the express office soon, and then, I take
it, if everything is shipshape, this queer contraption they call
a diving-boat and named the _Argonaut_, expects to get away from
Baltimore, eh, Oscar?

So the Captain told me, Ballyhoo. He has his clearance papers, all
right.

Huh! Guess the port officials didnt examine this craft as closely as
they might have done in these troublous times, with more than half the
world ablaze.

Lower your voice a bit, Ballyhoo, when you are referring to the
rifles, and that quick-firing gun theyve got so snugly hidden below.
But its all fair and square. Every steam craft is allowed one gun for
defensive purposes. Some big Atlantic liners have a three-inch gun at
the stern, you remember.

A very good reason we have, too, for carrying one, Oscar, since the
main object of our trip to tropical seas is the recovery of sunken
treasure.

And dont forget either, while about it, Ballyhoo, that theres
opposition in the field, a rival expedition headed by that old
blockade-runner and adventurer, Captain Badger.

Thats right, and we may need our gun badly before we come back
again--if we ever do.

Well, most of our interest in this wonderful trip doesnt lie in
the chance of finding the stores of gold and silver lying in the old
hulks of vessels that were sunk, some of them a hundred or two years
ago. Weve got our own plans to carry out, and could call the venture
a glorious success even if we didnt run across a single Spanish
doubloon.

Yes, providing the scheme works, as Jack believes it will, and his
judgment is worth a whole lot on anything that is connected with motion
picture photography. We hope to secure films that are bound to startle
the world of screen lovers, showing as they will the up to now unknown
secrets lying deep down under the surface of the sea.

Its a great risk were taking, but weve put over two big jobs so far
and why not a third? Those circus films are still going the rounds, and
pronounced gilt-edged wherever they are shown.[1]

Yes, and our series of pictures depicting wild animal life in
the African jungles have met with great favor too.[2] Weve been
overwhelmed ever since we got back, with all sorts of wildcat offers to
undertake new schemes, all of which so far weve had to turn down. And
yet here we are about to start off on the most hazardous adventure that
any one could possibly think of.

But this is different, you know, Ballyhoo; and besides it came to us
through that old uncle of your mothers, who has a third interest in
the venture, though he was knocked out of accompanying the boat by that
bad attack of rheumatism.

Well, I wish Jack would hurry up, because I think our Captain acts as
if he might be anxious to cast off, and steam down Chesapeake Bay.

The speakers were a couple of hardy looking well grown boys. They
lounged on the little upper deck, if such it could be called, of a
very odd-looking craft lying snugly hidden in a certain secluded basin
connected with a Baltimore shipyard.

In fact the low, squatty craft was nothing more nor less than a
submarine built somewhat after the style of those steel whaleback
barges used for carrying huge cargoes of grain on the Northern Lakes.

Money had not been spared in the building and equipping of this craft,
which was really owned and controlled by the Argonaut Submarine
Diving-boat Company, and constructed for a purpose which has been
partly disclosed by the brief conversation between the two boys.

Oscar Farrar and his two chums lived in the town of Melancton in
an Eastern State. The boy whom he had been calling by that quaint
nickname of Ballyhoo was really Jonathan Edwards Jones. For some
years he had taken such delight in mimicking the animals usually seen
in a menagerie, as well as the barkers who tried to coax the gaping
public to patronize their side shows, where all manner of freaks were
on exhibition, that naturally enough he soon found himself given the
name of Ballyhoo, which term is often used to designate loud-tongued
orators.

The third boy, whom they had mentioned as Jack, had Anderson for a
surname. He was a positive marvel in connection with anything that
had to do with photography in all its branches. His father before him
had been devoted to the art, and had spent several years, lost in the
wilds of Darkest Africa, a prisoner in the big kraal of a savage black
king, from which captivity he had only recently escaped, thanks to the
bravery of his son and his chums.
