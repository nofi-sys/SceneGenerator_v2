SCENE:
Jean was needed elsewhere; he made no attempt to continue his
conversation with Romain. He did not know why, but it had made him feel
a little uncomfortable.

It was only a small addition to the discomforts his pinched pride gave
him every day. All these little pin-pricks together only amounted to
the pain of a corn in a tight shoe. When the shoe made him most aware
of its presence was in the disagreeable business interviews with the
pupils. From the first Louis had sent him to collect money for the
accounts. Jean copied them daily into the book from Flauberts notes;
but the Toriallis pupils almost always disputed their accounts, and
Jeans dislike for these interviews increased daily.

I cant think what is the matter with these people, he said at last
to Louis. I can understand some of them being mean--but so many of
them are, men and women alike. And they seem so certain that they have
had fewer lessons or shorter hours. I suppose there _cant_ be any
mistakes in the accounts?

How can there be? said Louis, looking at Jean rather hard. I put
them all down in a book myself, you know, exactly as they take place.
Paris is full of cheats, and the worst of them are the rich.

Yes, but they arent all rich, Jean answered. Some of them are poor,
and that makes it so much worse.

I havent the time to explain just now, said Louis after a pause.
Be so kind as to write down the appointments for next week; and here,
by the by, is Miss Vanderpools account. You may take that to her
to-morrow.

Cant I send it? Jean asked.

No! She always likes to argue things out, said Flaubert. She thinks
she shows a business instinct. Mind you make her pay.

Really, Flaubert, I wish to Heaven youd do it yourself! said Jean
impulsively. The other day I heard you tell one of the pupils that a
mistake in the account was my fault, and you know I never make them out
at all!

Flaubert put his arm genially on the young mans shoulder.

My dear boy, he said. I apologize a thousand times. I had to get rid
of him, and to tell the truth I hadnt time for a fight. Madame had
just sent for me. You came into my head, and I made a scapegoat of you.
I apologize profoundly.

Jean drew away from the insinuating arm.

I should be very glad if you would give me your word that it doesnt
happen again! he said curtly.

Louis laughed nervously.

I will give you my word, of course, if you want it, my dear boy, he
said. But really, you know, youll never learn business at this rate.

Im afraid I must insist, said Jean.

Flaubert shook his head roguishly. I give you my word, then, he said;
but I dont know what Madame would say if she heard me; she believes
in a silent partner, does Madame.

But Madame has nothing to do with business? exclaimed Jean.

Flaubert bit his lip, and forced an unnatural laugh.

No, no! he said. Of course not, that is why we must be so careful
of her interests. By the by, if you so much dislike tackling the
great Pauline, you can after all leave her to me. If she does dispute
the account Ill try to make time for her; she is always disputing
something. No! send it by post; after all that is the best way.

Jean was immensely relieved. After all Flaubert was very easy to work
with; he was always good-natured, and he never took offence at any of
Jeans protests. Jean decided that he would try not to protest so much,
and he sent the account to Pauline. It seemed even to him, accustomed
to the enormous expenses of Toriallis lessons, an immense account.
He congratulated himself on not having to face Pauline with it.
Unfortunately his congratulations came a little too soon. The very next
day Pauline called, not at the hotel of the Toriallis, but at Louis
Flauberts house.

She was shown at once into the room where Jean was going through the
mornings correspondence. He was used by now to the sight of angry
women, but he had never before seen one so fixedly, fiercely angry as
Pauline Vanderpool.

Wheres your master? she asked Jean with no formal preface.
