SCENE:
VI

_Thats how they showed their respects for Paddy Murphy,
Thats how they showed their honour and their pride,
They said it was a shame for Pat, and winked at one another,
Everything in the wake-house went, on the night that Murphy died._

MURPHYS WAKE.


OCONNORS wagon had come and gone several times; a black streamer hung
from the bell knob; the shutters were bowed with a ribbon of the same
sombre hue. Groups of children sat upon cellar doors and talked in
whispers; slatternly women stood on doorsteps, morbidly watching all
who came or went at the house where old Larry lay dead. Mrs. Nolan, her
head muffled in a woollen shawl, was leaning out at her kitchen window,
likewise engaged, when Hogan the policeman came through the court upon
his evening round.

Are yez goin in? asked he, pausing.

Not the noight, replied Mrs. Nolan, all me bits av rags is in the
wash, an sorra a ting have I till put on me back. Bella an Dick
will, though, an mesilf will tmorry noight, plaze God.

Hogan drummed lightly upon a fireplug with his club. Its a Solemn
High Mass theyll be havin, said he.

Divil doubt it! An therell be a power av hacks at the funeral; Dick
wint for wan till McGraths, bud they wur all spoken.

Yezll not be at the Holy Cross, thin?

Faith, yiz. We have a hack av OConnors, an its go in stoyle
we will. Mrs. Nolan was looking toward Murphys as she spoke, and
suddenly exclaimed, in a startled voice:

Who is that, Micky, that young McGonagle have be the scruff av the
neck? Glory be! Is it foightin hed be in front av the house where the
corpse is?

A thick-set young man had staggered drunkenly up the steps of Murphys
house, just as Goose McGonagle halted before the door.

Say Kelly, Goose had remarked, dont youse tink yed better sober
up a little before youse go in there?

The man on the steps swayed to and fro and regarded him with
drink-reddened eyes.

Whas it your bizhness? demanded he. Dont ye put yer beak in
thish, McGonagle. Dye hear?

Put yer head to work, advised Goose, an have some sense, Murphys
got enough trouble now witout youse botherin him, Mart.

Im goin in, declared Martin Kelly, his thick voice raising angrily,
an whats more Im a-goin to lick Larry Murphy! Hes done me dirt;
an Im a-goin to do him up.

He tried to open the door, but McGonagle whirled him off the steps.

Ye aint a-goin to kick up no muss here, and that goes, said Goose,
decisively; youse must be daffy, aint ye?

Kelly had just aimed a wild blow at McGonagle when Hogan pounced upon
him.

So its yezsilf, Martin, sneered the policeman; its a great
foighter yez are gittin to be!

Take yer paws off a-me, Hogan, growled the drunken youth, struggling.
Me old manll have youse broke for this.

If ye dont quit makin a monkey av yezsilf its a ride in the wagon
yezll git.

Take the lush away, begged McGonagle; hell have the whole bloomin
neighbourhood up.

The expostulating Martin was hustled down the street just as Mary
Carroll opened the door.

Its ony Mart Kelly, Goose informed her, lifting his hat.

Im glad hes gone away, said Mary; for he was here this afternoon
when Mr. Murphy was out, and his talk was shameful. Are you coming in?

For a little while. Dont stand in the draf; it makes youse cough.
McGonagle followed her into the sitting room where the black box rested
upon a pair of low trestles. A number of wax lights burned at its
head and an aged woman knelt at the foot, her withered lips muttering
prayers for the repose of the departed soul. A dozen more women
neighbours sat around the room talking lowly.
