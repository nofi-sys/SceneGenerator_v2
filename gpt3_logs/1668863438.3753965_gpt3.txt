SCENE:
XIV


IT was some time before Jean called Margot into his room; and when he
did there was something in his expression which made her forget her
happy news. He looked unlike himself and as if something had shocked
him.

He walked up and down for an interminable time without speaking, while
Margot fingered nervously at one of the superfluous woollen mats.

Then he came up to her and put his hands on her shoulders. Margot,
he said, my little comrade, you have been deceiving me. No, do not
tremble or cry! I know well enough why you have done so, you only
wanted to spare me; but there are times when to be spared takes all the
strength out of a man. Do not try to spare me any more, Margot; tell me
the truth now, how much money a week do I cost you?

Money, Jean, cried Margot, her eyes grew very large and round as they
met his; she looked as innocent as only a woman bent on deception can
look. You think, then, that I am incapable of feeding you on eight
francs a week, she cried. It is to complain of my housekeeping that
you have brought me in here. How unkind, Jean! But Jean merely shook
his head at her.

Tell me who it is that blacks my boots, he said sternly.

Do you suppose that I have no friends, asked Margot, no admirers
who are anxious to do me a little turn? Apparently you think I have no
attractions, and the son of Madame Martin does not get up at six in the
morning, and run my errands, to be repaid thankfully by half a smile
out of a shut window?

Jean hesitated, but he felt relieved. He did not dream that Madame
Martins son was a fine invention of Margots called upon to do service
for one day only and not to be rewarded at all.

Any man would be glad to do anything for you, Jean said, smiling,
but if I were the son of Madame Martin, I think I should prefer to
black your boots, and not those of the young man who is on the right
side of the shut window!

I do not study his preferences, replied Margot demurely.

No? said Jean. But, Margot, I am going to ask you to study mine. I
cannot stay here another day unless you will take twenty francs a week
for my board; you see I put it very low to please you. It is no use
your shaking your head; either you agree or our little scheme together
ends. It is true, said Jean half to himself, that I still have to
earn that twenty francs, but even now that seemed to Jean the least
important part of any programme.

Jean, asked Margot, after a little pause, you will not think me
curious or indiscreet, but did you not tell me that you sometimes
accompanied Lucien le Page and Du Buissant? Surely such great artists
would pay you!

Jean smiled bitterly. They would pay me if they would employ me,
_chrie_, he answered, but you forget that they are friends of Madame
de Brances, and lately I have not found them at home when I called.
Last week I went so far as to write to Lucien; he replied very politely
that he was not in need of an _accompagnateur_. It is the same with
them all, they will not employ me again.

But Cartier, persisted Margot, who gave you your music lessons,
surely he will not treat you like that?

He is away in Russia, said Jean; he does not return till the spring.

The two young creatures looked at each other something passed between
them which contradicted the expectancy of youth. Their glance was
measured, anxious, guarded. It resulted in Margots saying, How long
is it now, Jean, since you left the Bank?

It is three months, said Jean.

How hard it is raining, exclaimed Margot thoughtfully. You ought to
get a new pair of boots. Those are very smart you have on, but rain
would go through them as if they were made of silk.

I do not think they would take me back, said Jean wistfully; he did
not want to think the Bank would take him back.

Perhaps not, agreed Margot. After all, the hours are not so long,
she added.

My aunt, Miss Prenderghast, wrote to my Uncle Romain to tell him I had
left it, said Jean. She says I have ruined my life!

Bah! exclaimed Margot, the English are a race of wet cats! I have
heard they never even dance on Sundays. Dont concern yourself with
anyone so ill-natured. After all, that Director of the Bank was a
friend of your uncle.
