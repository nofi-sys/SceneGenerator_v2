SCENE:
MacKeenon stepped between the girl and Fay. He clicked the handcuffs
suggestively as he dropped a hand into his coat pocket.

Coom on, he said, bringing out the cuffs.

No, Mac! Sir Richard snapped. Not yet! The smoked-glasses he threw
away interest methe triflelighter than air.

Fay shrugged his narrow shoulders and advanced to the table. He waited
for Sir Richard to speak.

Describe them, said the chief, leaning back. What were those glasses
like, Fay?

Ordinary! I saw nothing at all that would interest you in them. They
were darkalmost opaque. They had cheap German-silver bows.

Where are they now? Sir Richards voice held the grating edge of an
inquisitors.

Theyre in the North Sea off the Holland coast. Id say they went to
the bottom in about thirty feet of water. I threw them off a cliff. She
knows. Fay turned toward Saidee Isaacs.

He did, Sir Richard, said the girl quickly. He and I were together.
We had rowed ashore from a sinking ship. I forget its name. Dutch Gus
had the package and Chester took it from him. He sank the ship to get
it.

Ah, said the chief, that was enterpriseat any rate. Now where on the
Holland coast could I send a man to dive for the glasses?

Fay glanced about the room. If you get a good chart Ill show you, he
said.

Sir Richard rubbed his hands. Thatll keep, he declared. Well
remember it, though. Now, Fay, one other matter before I turn you over
to MacKeenon.

What is it?

How did it happen that you went to Arendal? What took you there?

I was trying to connect with a man named Harry Raymond.

Ace-in-the-hole Harry?

Yes! The deep-sea cardsharper!

What did you want to meet him for?

Last time I saw him he wore a pair of glasses like the pair I threw
away on the Holland coast. Saidee made me go after himor suggested that
I should.

No, it was his idea, said the girl staunchly.

Whoever thought of it, Sir Richard said, must have been sure there
was some connection between the two pairs of glasses.

Fay caught the deduction which had caused the chiefs remark. He felt
like a felon before a Crowns counsel. He bit his upper lip and toyed
with his cap which lay on the table. The bright cluster of bulbs over
his head brought out the clean-cut details of Sir Richards features.

He realized that the man whom he faced was the keenest ferret in all of
Europe. The chief was balked, but only temporarily. There was no beating
him. An inkling of the methods which had cost the underworld so many of
its choicest lights came to Fay. He recalled that Foley the Goat had
been caught by the mere matter of losing a coat-button. Then there was
the Marble Arch affair, where Scotland Yard had brought home the crime
to its instigators by the slender clue of five black hairs perfumed with
a certain Italian hair-tonic which only one shop in Soho poured upon the
heads of its customers.

Trifles had beaten the best-laid plans of those who lived beyond the
law. And now the hounds were snarling over another trifleas Sir Richard
saidlighter than air. The chief had caught the thin wedge between the
two pairs of smoked-glasses. He had guessed what Fay already knew. He
glanced up at the cracksman and smiled broadly.

So your friend, Harry-in-the-hole, wore the same kind of glasses? That
simplifies matters. It may solve the cipher for us!

Thats what I thought, said Fay positively.

Sir Richard stared at the ceiling and the bright electric cluster.
Lets see, he mused. Ace-in-the-hole Harrywhat an awful monacker,
Faywas arrested at the Crystal Palace for trimming a pigeon out of his
shirtalmost. Then he appeared again at Bow Street charged with running
a buffet flat in the West EndBrick Street, I think. They fleeced
everybody there at banker and broker and baccarat, or was it chemin de
fer?


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the connection between the two pairs of glasses, and to suggest that the person who wore the glasses with the smoked lenses may have been involved in the cipher that is being investigated.
