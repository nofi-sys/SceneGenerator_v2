SCENE:
Two boys loped along the winding, dusty road on the way to Eagles.
One of them, astride a white-faced mustang, was leading a third
horse, a bay, which, though riderless, was saddled and bridled. The
day was hot; the road steep and tortuous; and the riderless horse,
with head held low, was doing his best to retard the procession.

Taking a firmer hold of the leading rein, the boy gave it a jerk
forward.

Come up here, General! he cried. Where do you think youre
going--to a funeral? Pretty near train time and we still have a good
stretch ahead of us!

His companion, a slightly older youth, riding a brown pony, turned
in his saddle.

Is he holding back on you, Teddy? Those Spanish bridles make
awfully poor leading. I think hes got a sore mouth. And, if he has,
dadll find it out quick!

Boy, dont I know it! Why, Teddy Manley added with a chuckling
laugh, I bet dad could tell if General didnt sleep well the night
before. He sure is crazy over this horse!

Ill tell a maverick he is! cried Roy Manley. Last thing he told
me before he left was to be sure to bring General in to meet him.
But as far as liking goes, you dont exactly hate that Flash of
yours, I notice.

The other boy grinned and patted the side of his bronco.

Well, he admitted, Im not saying much, but you have no right to
talk about falling in love with a horse. The way you treat Star
would make any one think he was made of cut glass! All the while
its easy now, Star, you might hurt yourself! Is that cinch-strap
too tight, Star? Here, let me brush that fly off your ear! Huh! Do
you tuck him in bed and kiss him good-night, Roy?

Roy Manley refused the bait.

I remember, he said calmly, wiping the sweat from his upper lip
and leaving in its stead a streak of black dust, when you first got
Flash. Dad gave him to you for your birthday. You were just a little
shaver then--

Aw, donkey-dust! Who do you think you are--Methuselah? Just because
youre a year older--

You were just a little shaver then, Roy went on imperturbably,
and maybe you didnt know what you were doing. You simply went into
ecstasy. Get that--ecstasy? Sixty-cent word. Yep, you jumped up and
down with glee, Ill tell a maverick!

Well, if I jumped up and down with glee, you, by golly, stood on
your head when dad gave you Star! Now laugh that off!

We wont argue about it, Roy replied, with assumed dignity. Baby,
this road is sure some dusty! Winds right at our backs, too. If I
took a drink of water now Id turn into a mud-pie. Hey, Teddy, think
you can coax that cayuse youre riding into something more than a
trickle? Maybe hell run, if you talk to him real nice.

Teddy Manley did not reply, but clucked softly to his mount. Flash
responded with a leap that caused General, the bay that Teddy was
leading, to toss his head in protest.

Youd better be careful, Roy cautioned. Theres only one man who
can boss General, and thats dad. If the bay takes it into his head
to stop, hell _stop_, and neither one of us will be able to budge
him. Then dads train will pull in, and hell expect to find General
at the station waiting for him. And wherell we be?

Down in the cellar eating spinach, Teddy answered, with a grin.
Flash, here, wont let General balk on us! will you, old boy? and
Teddy leaned forward and rubbed the horses nose. Flash nuzzled his
masters hand affectionately.

Why dont you let up on that mush? Roy asked in a disgusted tone.
Go on, whisper pretty nothings in his ear! Talk about me and Star!
Why, when Gilly Froud--

Eyes blazing, Teddy turned swiftly on his brother.

Dont mention that curs name to me, he said thickly. You know
what he did to Flash? He kicked him, thats what he did! Kicked him!
And if dad hadnt stopped me, Id have--Id have--

Cool off, cool off, Roy advised soothingly. I dont like Froud
any more than you do. You know that. Anyway, dad threw him off the
ranch, so lets forget him. Come on, step on it. Dads train is due
soon.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between the two brothers and to foreshadow the conflict that will arise later in the story. The author achieves this by having the two brothers argue good-naturedly with each other and by having Teddy Manley become angry when his brother mentions the name of their father's enemy, Gilly Froud.
