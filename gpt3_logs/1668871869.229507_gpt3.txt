Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
"Yes," said another; "and that grass will grow over a black man's
grave or two ere long, if I don't much mistake."

"It wouldn't be worth while burying the fiends," said a third.
"We'll leave them to the rooks."

"Well," said Craig, "there's meat and damper there, men.  Stir up the
fire, warm your tea, and be happy as long as you can.  We're off to
bed."

Gentleman Craig was as good as his word next day.  He rode away in
search of the tribe, and after a long ride found them encamped on a
tableland.

As it turned out they knew him, and he rode quietly into their midst.

They were all armed with spear, and nullah, and boomerang.  They were
tattooed, nearly naked, and hideous enough in their horrid war-paint.

Craig showed no signs of fear.  Indeed he felt none.  He told the
chief, however, that he had not approved of the action of the white
men, his brothers, and had come, if possible, to make peace.  Why
should they fight?  There was room enough in the forest and scrub for
all.  If they--the blacks--would leave the cattle and flocks of the
squatters alone, he--Craig--could assure them things would go on as
happily as before.

"And if not?" they asked.

"If not, for one black man there was in the country, there were a
thousand white.  They would come upon them in troops, even like the
locusts; they would hunt them as they hunted the dingoes; they would
kill them as dingoes were killed, and before long all the black
fellows would be in the land of forgetfulness.  What would it profit
them then that they had speared a few white fellows?"

Craig stayed for hours arguing with these wild men, and left at last
after having actually made peace with honour.

The cloud had rolled away, for a time at all events.  In the course
of a few days Archie and his man left on his return journey.
Findlayson made up his mind to go on with him to Burley New Farm; for
this Scot was very fond of an occasional trip eastwards, and what he
called a "twa-handed crack" with Bob or Harry.

Everybody was glad to see him; for, truth to tell, no one had ever
seen Findlayson without a smile on his old-fashioned face, and so he
was well liked.

Bob came galloping out to meet them, and with him, greatly to
Archie's astonishment, was what he at first took for a black bear.

The black bear was Bounder.

Archie dismounted and threw his arms round the great honest dog's
neck, and almost burst into tears of joy.

For just half a minute Bounder was taken aback; then memory came
rushing over him; he gave a jump, and landed Archie on his back, and
covered his face and hair with his canine kisses.  But this was not
enough.  Bounder must blow off steam.  He must get rid of the
exuberance of his delight before it killed him.  So with a
half-hysterical but happy bark he went off at a tangent, and
commenced sweeping round and round in a circle so quickly that he
appeared but a black shape.  This wild caper he kept up till nearly
exhausted, then returned once more to be embraced.

"So they've come."  It was all that Archie could say.

Yes, they had come.  Elsie had come, Rupert had come, Branson and
Bounder had come.

And oh, what a joyful meeting that was!  Only those who have been
separated for many long years from all they love and hold dear, and
have met just thus, as Archie now met his sister and brother, can
have any appreciation of the amount of joy that filled their hearts.

The very first overflowing of this joy being expended, of course the
next thing for both Archie and the newcomers to say was, "How you've
changed!"

Yes, they had all changed.  None more so than Elsie.  She always gave
promise of beauty; but now that Archie held her at arms' length, to
look at and criticise, he could not help exclaiming right truthfully:

"Why, Elsie, you're almost as beautiful as Etheldene!"

"Oh, what a compliment!" cried Rupert.  "I wouldn't have it, Elsie.
That '_almost_' spoils it."
