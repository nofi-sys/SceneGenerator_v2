SCENE:
Yes, Maida answered. White peacocks. I am so glad they were there.
Everything has happened just as I wanted it. Sometimes it will be days
before you see deer, although there are so many here. And sometimes
the peacocks wander to the back of the house. I knew you wanted to see
them, Dicky, and Ive been hoping all along that they would be here for
you. There are seven. We have a dozen.

Dicky was listening with all his ears; but at the same time he was
looking with all his eyes. For out of the trees to the left, suddenly
appeared another pair of peacocks in full sail. Not white ones this
time; great prismatic, blue and green creatures--the sun struck bronze
lights out of them as they floated on.

Its like a fairy tale, Dicky breathed.

Are we going to live there? Rosie asked in an awed tone.

Oh mercy no! Maida answered. Thats fathers house--the Big House.
Our house is ever so much nicer.

I hope it isnt any bigger, Laura said, her voice a little awed too.

Maida laughed a little. No its not quite as big as that, she
admitted.

Shall I go on, Miss Maida? Botkins asked.

Yes, please Botkins, Maida answered. And they continued to go
on through more winding, geometrically perfect, beautifully-kept,
gray roads; past armies and armies of trees: high, plumy-tipped,
feathery-trunked aristocratic elms; vigorous, irregular-shaped,
peasant-like oaks; clumps, gracefully-slender, fluttering a veil of
green leaves, of white birch; occasional pine, resinous and shining;
beeches; firs. Suddenly everybody exclaimed at once, Oh see the pond!

What pond is it? Harold asked.

Its called by some people Spy Pond, Maida answered, but I call it
the Magic Mirror. Its our pond and I think I ought to be allowed to
call it what I want.

I think so too, agreed Laura.

What do you mean by _our_ pond? Arthur asked.

Just what I say, Maida replied promptly. Its our pond. It belongs
to my father and its a part of the grounds of Maidas Little House.
We can go swimming in it every day. That is if we dont prefer-- She
broke off in a little embarrassed laugh.

Oh Maida you are so full of secrets I could _kill_ you, Rosie
threatened.

Maida only laughed.

They passed the pond which stretched for a considerable distance, long
and crescent-shaped between its tree-hung banks, and now they were in
the real forest. The road was smooth as always and beautifully-kept,
but on both sides, the forest had been left to grow as it pleased. It
was filled with underbrush. The tree trunks were obscured by great
bushes. Here and there through openings, the children could see
gigantic rocks thrusting great heads and shoulders out of the masses of
rusty-colored leaves.

Oh isnt it lovely! Rosie said in a perfect ecstasy. Lovely, lovely,
lovely! she went on repeating dreamily as though caught in a trance of
delight. She ended with a scream. Did you see that? What was it Maida?

A woodchuck, Maida answered smilingly.

Timmie awakened by Rosies scream, asked if there were any lions and
tigers about. Much disappointed at Maidas _no_, he fell asleep again.

And now they seemed to be going up hill, slowly but steadily up. Up,
up, up. The car had begun to speed a little. Ahead was another rounding
curve. Botkins took it with a flash.

The car came out in front of--

It was one of the little colonial farmhouses a story-and-a-half in
height; weather-colored, slant-roofed; to which addition after addition
has been added by succeeding generations. It was set in an expanse
of lawn, cut cleanly in two by a path of irregularly-shaped, sunken
stones, dominated, one on either side, by twin elms of enormous girth
and amplitude. The house faced the east.

The additions, which now merged into one long structure, had gone off
to the right and the north where they joined a big barn. This barn
was the same velvety, gray weather-color as the house but with great
doors painted a strange deep old blue which had faded to an even
stranger, deeper blue. The sun struck into the open door and shot
over the shining sides of half-a-dozen brilliantly colored canoes
lying face-downwards on the floor; glittered in the bright-work of
half-a-dozen bicycles, drawn up in a line.

The style of this scene is very descriptive. The author uses a lot of detail to describe the setting and the characters' reactions to it. The tone is also quite dreamy and magical, as if the reader is experiencing the scene along with the characters.
