SCENE:
But the lad was too late. The puncher, realizing the turn affairs
had taken, disappeared through the side door, slamming it behind
him. When Teddy reached it and flung it open, the man was gone. It
would be useless, as well as foolhardly, to follow down that dark
passageway upon which the door gave entrance. Best to hunt for the
fellow outside the place, or to hope Gus and Nick, who had waited at
the front of the restaurant, had seen and stopped him. Teddy turned
back.

You all right, Dad? Roy and Teddy asked in almost the same breath.

All right, boys, their father answered cheerfully. He never
touched me.

Whatll we do with this varmint, boss? Pop asked, poking the
barkeeper with the barrel of his gun.

I cracked him one on the wrist, Mr. Manley said. Guess well let
him alone, Pop. He wont do no harm for a long while yet. Say,
whered that other hombre get to?

He ducked out, Teddy answered. Went through a side door. I didnt
chase him, because I didnt know where hed gone. I thought maybe
Nick or Gus would spot him.

Maybe. I hope so. That bucker knows something about our ponies, or
Im a ring-tailed doodlebug. Pop, quit pokin that geezer with your
gun. Hey, you-- this to the geezer sharply, better have that arm
bandaged, or itll go bad on you. This was characteristic of
Bardwell Manley--solicitous even of a man who had tried to attack
him from the back.

Boss, we better get out of here, Pop declared. If you want to
hunt them broncs, we ought to get goin.

As usual, Pop, your lips gives forth words of wisdom. We shall
leave. Stranger, you tend to that arm of yours.

Mr. Manley, followed by Teddy, Roy, and Pop, made for the door.
Outside, in the street, a crowd awaited them. That is, a crowd for
Eagles--population one hundred and fifty in a rush season. Three
cowboys, one woman, and five children stood staring curiously at the
four men as they emerged from Rimors Place. Nick and Gus Tripp were
prancing about on restless ponies, rifles held in readiness. As
these two saw the four men, their faces cleared and Nick yelled:

Everything O. K., boss?

Yes! Mr. Manley answered. Then, as his eye roved over the small
crowd in front of the restaurant, he added. We were havin a little
argument, thats all. Its all over now.

The cowboys looked dubious at this explanation of the yelling, but
the gathered people slowly drifted away. The boys remounted their
ponies, which, like good Western horses, had stood quiet when the
reins were thrown over their heads and left dangling.

Roy urged his animal over to Nick.

Say, Nick, he said in a low voice, you and Gus didnt see
anything of a puncher in a checkered shirt busting out of Rimors,
did you?

No, we didnt, Roy, Nick answered.

He the bucker what was doin the yelling? Gus asked casually. It
would take a great deal to startle Gus out of his placid way. When
he acted, he acted quickly. When he did nothing, to quote himself,
he did it just as slow as he knew how. Gus was a product of New
Mexico.

He didnt do any yelling, Teddy answered. That was done by the
New York plug-ugly theyve got in there for a barkeeper. Dad taught
him a few things about the use of a revolver.

Kill him? Gus drawled, as though he were asking the time of day.

Certainly not! Roy answered, startled. He just clubbed him. Put
his right arm out of commission by a crack from the butt of his
gun.

Nick Looker nodded approvingly. Nick was young and fair-haired. He
had not the assumed callousness of Gus. He knew, though, that
beneath this pretended hardness, Gus had a heart as soft as a
womans.

Well be gettin on, Mr. Manley said. He had heard Nick say he had
not seen checkered shirt, as Roy called the puncher, and he knew
there would be no use in delaying further. They could get no
information in Eagles.
