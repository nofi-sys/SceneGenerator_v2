SCENE:
But how can you----

He must come on Christmas Day, in the evening. You know how my
brothers will celebrate Christmas by drinking more than usual, and
then quarreling among themselves. They will soon give me an excuse for
leaving their society, and I will meet Colonel Richardson at the gate
at the bottom of the garden--the one that leads to the short cut to
Beckham.

You would risk that? Think what you are doing, Lilian. Colonel
Richardson would never consent to put your reputation in peril like
that.

He will put himself in peril too, with my wild brothers about; so
hell risk it. And I know how to make him come. Ill tell him, if he
doesnt come down here, Ill come up to London to see him.

Lily, are you mad? I will not help you to do this.

Very well, then; Ill risk it without your help--post my own letter,
receive the answer, and you may betray me to George if you dare. I
believe I am mad, I am so miserable!

And all for a man who doesnt appreciate you, who likes Annie better
than you?

It is not true, said she fiercely. If I believed that, she should
not stay in the house a day longer--I would not rest until I got the
little hypocrite turned out! But it is not true--it is not true! Now,
will you desert me at the last just when I am so wretched, and have
nobody to help me?

I will serve you to the end, for good or for evil, as I have always
done, Lily; you know I live only for that. When you are gone, whether
Mr. Falconer marries you or somebody else, my wretched life will be
no good to me, and I dont care how soon I lose it. No one will ever
worship you as I do, Lily, nor for so little thanks.

But she soothed him with sweet words and kind eyes. She did indeed feel
the strength of his devotion, and, moreover, he was too useful an ally
not to be worth a few kind speeches.

So the letter was sent, and the answer came--and the secret was safe.

Since the regular hunting-season had begun, Harrys neglect of his wife
had not only grown more open than ever, but had been supplemented by
sneers at her refined tastes and poetry, prunes, prism manners. She
could not tell the cause of this change, and went on quietly in her own
way, dutifully caring for his small comforts, and accepting his coarse
snubs with the same placid indifference with which she had formerly
taken his scanty thanks.

When Christmas Day arrived it was spent just as Lilian had predicted.
In the morning the ladies went to church, accompanied by Stephen and
William. As there was no hunting, and Lady Braithwaite had insisted
upon the grooms having a holiday, the other young men spent the
afternoon in the stable and the billiard-room, wrangling more than
usual. Wilfred had already remonstrated with George for teasing Harry.

You are always saying things to put his back up now. What do you do it
for? he asked.

I dont care a straw what he says! cried Harry, sullenly, who was
flushed and excited long before the afternoon was over. And, as for
my not being a person of authority, as he calls it, I have as much
authority as anybody here.

Over whom or over what, pray? said George, tauntingly. I dont say
you cant manage a horse as well as--an hostler; but show me the man or
woman on whom your word or your opinion has the slightest effect.

Well, I like that! burst out Harry, his face twitching with passion.
Dont I manage my own wife--doesnt she obey me, and quickly, too? Do
you ever hear her contradict me or differ from my opinion? Answer me,
or, by Jove, Ill make you!

Your wife doesnt think your opinion worth differing from, and
she obeys you as the shortest way of getting rid of your presence.
Everybody knows that.

I say, George, do shut up! broke in Wilfred. Cant you see you are
only irritating him against his poor little wife, who has quite enough
to put up with from him already? What on earth are you driving at?
Cant make you out lately!

Dont interfere with your infernal preaching! shouted Harry. So my
wife has enough to put up with from me already! Very well, shell have
more than enough, then, before long, if she doesnt get rid of her
confoundedly cold tragedy-queen airs, I can tell her! Ill show her
and you too if Im not master of my own wife! And Harry flung away the
cigar-end he had been biting, and swung himself out of the yard, unable
to control himself any longer.
