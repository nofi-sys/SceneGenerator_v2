SCENE:
Fay stooped and pinched the candles wick with his fingers.

He backed across the floor and found that she had barred the way to the
door. He could see her face from the light that sifted in through the
curtain.

Lets go, he said as her breath fanned his cheek. Open the door,
Saidee.

Wait.

He felt some pity for her at that instant. The lines about her mouth had
softened perceptibly. He had heard that a man who knows little or
nothing about a womanidealizes her.

Whats the matter? he asked pityingly. Are you going to cave in and
cry on account of the cipher-key? Id give it to you, Saidee, but there
is still danger.

It isnt that, she said as she twisted the knob and peered out into
the hall. I wanted to see if you were really in earnest about taking it
to Sir Richard. I dont want you to take itanywhere elseGermany, for
instance.

Never, whispered Fay as he seized her arm and guided her through the
hallway.

Now on tiptoes, he said as they reached the stairs. Hold your bag
high and walk on the side of the steps. Thats right, Saidee. Now back
toward a window I saw. The door is locked toward the street. I heard him
lock it.

Fay unclasped his fingers from her arm and tried the window. It led out
into the courtyard. He raised the sash, guided her through the narrow
opening, turned and backed out with both bags. He drew down the sash
until the window was closed. Then he stepped to her side in the gloom.

This way, pal, he said with a world of quiet assurance. Theres the
old auto you hired. And theres the way out. I dont believe we got a
rumble. Were like two actors beating a board-bill, arent we?

She nodded her head, the plumes of her hat bobbing. She did not do any
of the things which might displease him. She walked at his side with
swift strides. Her glance was before her without the furtive back-stare
of the amateur. Her voice was natural and pitched in a low key. They
passed a sleepy burger or two. Once a watchman stepped out and glanced
at them. Fay remembered this and took a side street to throw the police
off his trail.

They reached the first of the taverns and the quays. Murky, yellow fog
wrapped the dykes and lowland. Spars and masts showed. Funnels and
ventilators were thrust over the roofs of the warehouses. Sails hung in
buntlines and gaskets. Fisher craft loomed through the mists. The tang
of the sea was there in that inland port.

Four oclock, said Fay, listening to the strokes of the bell in the
Htel de Ville. The police drag-net will be spread. Well go this way,
Saidee.

He grasped her arm and led the way down between two storehouses whose
ends were thrust like fingers out into the wide pool of the Schwartz
Canal. A small boat with oars was moored to the left-hand pier. Fay
dropped into this, reached and caught the bags as she tossed them down,
then assisted her to a damp seat in the stern of the boat. He cut the
painter with his knife, listened a moment as the boat drifted with the
tide, then he got out the oars and started rowing toward the opposite
bank.

A winding shroud dropped around them. A billowing mass of wet sea fog
rolled over the city and blotted out the view of the shore and the
shipping. There was no sound save the rattle of the oars in the locks.
Fay bent his back and leaned close to the girl.

Were getting on, he said. Well carry high, Saidee, and go over the
top of this cipher matter.

She shivered slightly and drew her skirt about her knees. Her head
turned toward the shore they had quitted. She attempted to pierce the
gloom. It was opalescent and filled with strange lights.

The police, said she, will miss this boat.

Ill kick it out when we land.

Holland Yard will coperate with Scotland Yard.

Let them. Im going to take the cipher-key to Sir Richard, in person.
He had no right sending MacKeenon on my trail.

You still have it, Chester?
