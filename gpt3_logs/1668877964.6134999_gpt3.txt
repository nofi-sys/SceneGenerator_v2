SCENE:
XIX

ESCAPE


It was not fright that held Roy motionless, but a realization of the
hopelessness of resistance. A slight tightening of the crooked
finger that touched the trigger would send a ball of lead tearing
through his body, and at the short range there could be but one
result. It seemed best to Roy that he bide his time.

Nice of you to call on me like this, Gilly Froud went on, in that
sinister, mocking tone. An I begs youll excuse the looks of the
place. We aint quite ready to receive visitors, yet.

What did you do with our horses and with Bug Eyes flivver? Roy
asked, looking straight at the man.

This Froud was no weakling. He sat hunched over in his saddle, huge
shoulders bent forward. The arm which supported the gun wavered not
an inch, but held firm as a rock.

Dont start askin questions, Froud growled. It wont do you no
good, cause I dont know nothin about yore hosses. I heard you had
em stolen from the hitchin rail at Eagles. Well, any one whos
fool enough to leave a hoss unguarded in that town, should have him
stolen!

Thats a lie, Froud, and you know it! Roy said hotly. Theyd
never have been touched if it hadnt been for you--and that pal of
yours in the checkered shirt.

Hey? Whats that? Froud exclaimed in a startled voice. The muzzle
of the gun pointed downward for a moment, but Froud quickly brought
it to bear again upon the boy. What do you know about a man in a
checkered shirt? Speak up!

Enough, Roy ventured grimly. He was watching the rustler closely,
ready to take advantage of any chance offered. But Froud did not
relax his vigilance.

Whats his name, this bird in the--er--striped shirt? the former
cowboy from the X Bar X demanded.

I dont know his name, but I know him! the boy exclaimed. And I
know hes one of your gang, too!

So you dont know his name, hey? Froud appeared relieved. Well,
hes no friend o mine. He travels with a different outfit than what
I do. Here--

Froud suddenly peered out from the trees. The next moment he jammed
the gun into Roys ribs.

You make a sound an Ill drill you sure! he whispered fiercely.

Cautiously, Roy turned his head. Not fifty feet away was his brother
Teddy, riding slowly along past the grove.

Quiet! Froud ordered softly between set teeth. If you want to see
how two ounces of lead feels between yore ribs, just yell! By golly,
Ill blow yore liver right out o you!

Roy recognized the desperate ring in the rustlers voice and knew
that the least move on his part would result in his death. Froud was
seized with a sort of panic, and at the slightest sign from Teddy
that the latter knew of his brothers plight, the rascal would start
shooting.

As Roy saw his brother pass out of sight, he felt the pressure of
the gun at his side relax, and Froud unconsciously sighed with
relief.

Im takin no chances, he whispered in Roys ear. Dont you talk
till I say so! Do you hear?

A moment more, and the sound of Teddys horse died away in the
distance.

Guess hes gone, Froud declared. But I dont want no funny work,
savvy? Dont think that because I havent got this gun stuck in yore
ribs that I aint got you covered. You keep both yore hands on the
pommel of yore saddle--no lower.

If you didnt steal our broncs, whats the idea of being so
touchy? Roy asked in as innocent a voice as he could summon. Why
not let me ride on and try to find the thieves who took Bug Eyes
flivver?

Thats my business! Froud retorted savagely. When I wants advice
from you, Ill ask for it, see? I aint forgot how your old man
kicked me off the X Bar X!
