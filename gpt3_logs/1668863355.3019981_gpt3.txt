What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
It was not possible that he could wholly succeed in hiding from Liane
his intense separation of spirit. She knew, indeed, extremely little
about spirit, but on the other hand she knew a great deal about lovers,
and it did not escape her that Jean had, at moments, the power of
estranging himself from her possession. At the end of the fortnight
Maurice returned from the provinces, and Jean explained to Liane in her
dressing-room at the Odon that he had met Maurice.

Well, said Liane impatiently. I do not see anything very
extraordinary in that. I have also met him, _mon cher_; what then?

But you must not meet him again, Liane, not now, said Jean quietly.
You say the flat is your own, so I shall not ask you to leave it, but
you must not allow Maurice to visit you there again.

Liane was silent a moment from sheer astonishment. It was true that
with a desire to spare Jeans feelings she had told him the flat was
her own. It was equally true that it was not--not in the sense in which
she had led Jean to believe it to be.

Must not, Jean! she repeated, laying down her powder-puff and
regarding him with blank amazement. Are you mad? What has this poor
Maurice done, then, that I am not to receive him?

Liane! Liane! cried Jean, taking both her hands in his. Why do you
pretend that you do not understand me? You do! you do! you do!

Liane withdrew her hands and returned to her powder-puff.

You are absurd, she said coldly. Do not enrage me with your virtues
from the provinces. I will not be taught how to live by a chicken whose
shell I have just broken. I shall receive whom I like when I like. One
would think, Monsieur, that I was your wife. Let me hear no more of
these impertinences!

Jean went to the window and opened it; something in his brain seemed to
be burning to escape; he felt hot, savage, and reckless. No, she was
not his wife; he supposed if she were he might have trusted her, he
might have respected her. As it was, he did not, he hated her. All his
heart seemed filled with a hard exasperation. When he turned to face
her again, his eyes were fierce.

I told him he could not come, he said; if you receive him you do it
at your own risk.

You told Maurice--told him he could not come? Liane gasped.

I told him you must choose between us, Jean continued doggedly. I
know he has all the things I have not got. I have nothing to offer
you--yes, that is true. You see me here, Liane; how much do you suppose
I have in my pocket? I think I have three francs. Well, it is all I
shall have till the end of the month. Maurice is, I believe, rich;
but there is one thing I have which I will not give up, and that is my
pride. Now which is it to be, tell me. If it is Maurice, I go!

Liane contrived to stare at him for a moment without speaking. She
could say a good deal, but she was not going to say any of it at
present. Jean with his ardent eyes full of fire and tears charmed her
jaded senses. He was a new experience, she valued him. As for Maurice,
that was another story. She could, she fancied, make some arrangement
about Maurice. He would not cry for the moon, and she could manage
for him to have something short of that commodity. As far as Jean was
concerned, it was quite unnecessary that he should know anything about
her arrangements. The blank look passed out of her eyes, she opened her
arms to him and he knelt beside her, a child in her hands, trembling
with distress at his own temerity.

Only trust me, Jean, she whispered. You do trust me?

You wont see him, Liane?

Selfish little boy, to please you then--no.

Jean gave a long sigh of relief. Where was his hatred now? His bitter
antagonism? that feeling in his heart of remorseless hardness? It
seemed impossible that they had ever existed and incredible that they
should ever exist again; but even now they were only hidden, like
the sharp teeth of rocks covered for the moment by the rush of the
incoming tide.

Liane carried out a suitable arrangement, and Jean believed that she
had obeyed him; it made him extraordinarily humble and tender with
her; he could not do enough to show his gratitude; and Liane was
not always easy to serve, she required so much and she had a most
terrible temper. Jean set himself to please her with an almost feminine
gentleness and tact. He did not ask from her refined sensibilities or
quick perceptions. He called her to himself a great artist, and he made
himself believe that this excused everything.

He was very young and he loved her, and the young cannot love without
the divine fire. They must look for their vine to bring forth grapes,
and when it brings forth wild grapes they shut their eyes.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Jean and Liane, and to establish Jean's character. Jean is presented as a proud and idealistic young man, who is willing to sacrifice everything for his principles. Liane is presented as a cold and selfish woman, who is only interested in Maurice because he is wealthy.
