SCENE:
Tell me what you have done, she asked again.

Opened the sea-cocks, Saidee.

ButI dont understand.

You will! This wont be the first ship that has been sunk in the same
manner. I dont think there is any way to save her. See, shes listing
to starboard. Hear the crew?

They stepped to the cabin door. The Germans by the life-boat had
vanished. A running of footsteps sounded overhead. The hoarse voice of
the captain blared through the fog. An oiler burst through the
engine-room companion and staggered forward.

Shes sinking! he shouted in English. Der ship is sinking!

I hope it is, said Fay. The fools havent sense enough to shut off
the sea-cocks and start the bilge pumps. A little black water in an
engine room is very disconcerting. Come, Saidee, he added. Dutch Gus
will be driven from his cabin like a rat from a hole.

She walked past him. He saw her climb to the after boat and jerk at the
lanyard of the wooden plug. The cord broke. He passed around the
pilot-house, grasped a hand-rail and lowered himself to the starboard
side as the ship lurched and her bow went under a northern wave.

Pandemonium seized the decks. The crew and the engine-room force lost
their heads. Their one thought was to outboard the life-boats and get
away. Burly forms loomed through the fog. Knives slashed at the boats
lashings. Fay heard a cry from aft. A boat had already been lowered. He
glided along the canted deck and saw that the door to Dutch Guss cabin
was still barred. The German crook had been deserted by his companions.
The planks, nailed in place by the purser and the deck hand, were stout
ones.

Fay waited until Saidee Isaacs came through the fog and the sea-spray.
She was water-soaked and frightened. She had seen the crew deserting the
ship.

Get by that forward boat! he ordered. Ill be there in a minute. The
ship will float a little longer. Stand by, Saidee, and wait for me!

He grasped the rail and edged toward Dutch Guss door. Stout blows
indicated that the crook was trying to pound his way out. The panels had
been shattered. The way was barred by the planks which were nailed to
the sills.

The cracksman grasped the end of one of these, braced his feet against
the cabin-sheathing, and jerked the plank from its nail hold. He dropped
his hand swiftly to his side pocket and drew out the tiny revolver.
Poising it, he waited grimly.

First the shock-head and then the evil, heavy-browed eyes of the crook
appeared. These were followed by his shoulders.

Get back! snapped Fay, thrusting forward his revolver. Get
backyouGet back!

Fay moved toward Saidee Isaacs. She was standing helplessly by the
boats falls.

Cast these off, he said, bending and untwisting the ropes from the
cleats. Thats right, help! Now get into the boat. Ill lower it. See,
it goes out and down. The water isnt far.

A reaching comber lapped over the bow of the doomed freighter and curled
along the upper decks. Fay braced himself against this flood. He saw the
boat lift and then drop into a trough of the waves. It crashed against
the ships plates. Saidee Isaacs was thrown against a gunwale. She
raised to her knees and glanced helplessly up at him.

He turned and darted a swift survey of the canted deck. Dutch Gus was
crawling through the opening between the planks. The stern of the ship
was a swelter of foam and curling eddies. A small-boat, crowded with
Dutch seamen, tossed like an egg-shell upon the crest of a wave. It
disappeared in the hollow between two great seas.

Fay climbed over the rail, waited, then leaped the distance for the
small-boat. He landed in the stern and fell sideways. He rose and
grasped the gunwales; Saidee Isaacss face was not more than a foot from
his. Her dark eyes had opened to their widest proportions. Her hat and
waist were sodden with brine.

He smiled reassuringly. Buck up, Saidee! he said. Think of poor Dutch
Gus. Watch, when he jumps.

Wonder broke through the beauty of her eyes. She turned and stood erect.
The dingy freighter was on the verge of its last plunge. The starboard
rails were under the sea. A single figure climbed for the highest
places. It appeared on the top of the pilot-house. Fog wrapped the
standing rigging. Wind and mist blotted out the view.
