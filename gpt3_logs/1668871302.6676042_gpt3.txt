SCENE:
VII.

"_THEY'RE UP TO SOME BLACK WORK TO-NIGHT._"

Another summer flew all too fast away at Burley Old Farm and Castle
Tower.  The song of birds was hushed in the wild woods, even the
corn-crake had ceased its ventriloquistic notes, and the plaintive
wee lilt of the yellow-hammer was heard no more.  The corn grew ripe
on braeland and field, was cut down, gathered, stocked, and finally
carted away.  The swallows flew southwards, but the peewits remained
in droves, and the starlings took up their abode with the sheep.
Squires and sturdy farmers might now have been met tramping, gun in
hand, over the stubble, through the dark green turnip-fields, and
over the distant moorlands, where the crimson heather still bloomed
so bonnie.

Anon, the crisp leaves, through which the wind now swept with harsher
moan, began to change to yellows, crimsons, and all the hues of
sunset, and by-and-by it was hunting-time again.

Archie was unusually thoughtful one night while the family sat, as of
yore, round the low fire in the green parlour, Elsie and Rupert being
busy in their corner over a game of chess.

"In a brown study, Archie?" said his mother.

"No, mummie; that is, Yes, I was thinking----"

"Wonders will never cease," said Rupert, without looking up.  Archie
looked towards him, but his brother only smiled at the chessmen.  The
boy was well enough now to joke and laugh.  Best of signs and most
hopeful.

"I was thinking that my legs are almost too long now to go to the
meet on poor Scallowa.  Not that Scallowa would mind.  But don't you
think, mummie dear, that a long boy on a short pony looks odd?"

"A little, Archie."

"Well, why couldn't father let me have Tell to-morrow?  He is not
going out himself."

His father was reading the newspaper, but he looked at Archie over
it.  Though only his eyes were visible, the boy knew he was smiling.

"If you think you won't break your neck," he said, "you may take
Tell."

"Oh," Archie replied, "I'm quite sure I won't break my neck!"

The Squire laughed now outright.

"You mean you _might_ break Tell's, eh?"

"Well, dad, I didn't _say_ that."

"No, Archie, but you _thought_ it."

"I'm afraid, dad, the emphasis fell on the wrong word."

"Never mind, Archie, where the emphasis falls; but if you let Tell
fall the emphasis will fall where you won't like it."

"All right, dad, I'll chance the emphasis.  Hurrah!"

The Squire and Mr. Walton went off early next day to a distant town,
and Branson had orders to bring Tell round to the hall door at nine
sharp; which he did.  The keeper was not groom, but he was the
tallest man about, and Archie thought he would want a leg up.

Archie's mother was there, and Elsie, and Rupert, and did Kate, and
little Peter, to say nothing of Bounder and Fuss, all to see "t'
young Squire mount."  But no one expected the sight they did see when
Archie appeared; for the lad's sense of fun and the ridiculous was
quite irrepressible.  And the young rascal had dressed himself from
top to toe in his father's hunting-rig--boots, cords, red coat, hat,
and all complete.  Well, as the boots were a mile and a half too big
for him--more or less, and the breeches and coat would have held at
least three Archie Broadbents, while the hat nearly buried his head,
you may guess what sort of a guy he looked.  Bounder drew back and
barked at him.  Old Kate turned her old eyes cloudwards, and held up
her palms.  Branson for politeness' sake tried not to laugh; but it
was too much, he went off at last like a soda-water cork, and the
merriment rippled round the ring like wild-fire.  Even poor Rupert
laughed till the tears came.  Then back into the house ran Archie,
and presently re-appeared dressed in his own velvet suit.

But Archie had not altogether cooled down yet.  He had come to the
conclusion that having an actual leg up, was not an impressive way of
getting on to his hunter; so after kissing his mother, and asking
Rupert to kiss Elsie for him, he bounded at one spring to Branson's
shoulder, and from this elevation bowed and said "good morning," then
let himself neatly down to the saddle.


BRIEF OUTLINE:

-Archie is thinking about how he has outgrown his pony, Scallowa, and how he would look odd on her now.
-He asks his father if he can ride Tell tomorrow instead, and his father agrees.
-The next morning, Archie dresses himself in his father's hunting gear and surprises everyone.
-He then gets on Tell and they ride off.
