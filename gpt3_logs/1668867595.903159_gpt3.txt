SCENE:
Then came the sharp report of the automatic. Jack involuntarily ducked,
as though willing enough to make as small a target as possible for the
excited marksman. It seemed as though the man either did not mean to do
any deadly damage for fear of the immediate consequences, or else had
his aim badly shaken by the jarring of the wildly running little motor.

Things had by this time reached a crisis, and the result must be a
collision between the two craft. At the very last the wheelsman had
attempted to make a quick swerve, abandoning his weapon in order to pay
attention to his boat, but it was useless.

The man in the conning tower of the submarine had his orders, and knew
just what was expected of him. There followed a loud crash as the blunt
bow struck the small motor-boat squarely in the centre. Two figures
were seen flinging into the sea on one side, and almost like magic the
cedar motor-boat, splintered by the shock, sank under the agitated
waves.

Immediately the submarine was stopped almost in its own length.

Weve got to rescue those poor chaps! cried Oscar involuntarily, for
all of them had been thrilled by the catastrophe.

There, I can see one of them over yonder! called out Ballyhoo; and
hes waving his hand to us as if he feared wed run along and leave him
out here. Hurry, boys, and get around to him, because he acts like he
might be hurt, or else cant swim very well.

And I can see the other sailor now, added Oscar, just to one side
of the first one. They both act as if they wanted to surrender. Its a
long way to land, and then only the Key would be left after all, where
we could easily find them.

The submarine by this time was making a turn, and heading back to the
spot where the collision had occurred. So far only those two men,
together with a few things connected with the sunken motor-boat could
be seen floating around--a couple of cork cushions, and some parts of
woodwork that had been broken clear of the wreck.

As for the boat itself it had completely vanished, such was the
tremendous impact with which the onrushing submarine had struck.

After making a turn they were now pushing toward the two sailors in the
water. These fellows made no attempt to swim off toward the island, but
seemed satisfied to tread water, and wait to be picked up. They could
not believe those on the submarine meant them any further harm, since
by this accident they had been deprived of all chance to carry their
information to the one who employed them.

Where did that third man go to? asked Ballyhoo, suddenly remembering
that there had been still another aboard the ill-fated launch.

Oscar pointed toward the Key.

If you will look yonder youll glimpse him, he went on to say. Hes
swimming for all hes worth, and now hes bobbed under just like a
wounded duck.

What a silly fool, laughed Ballyhoo, to think he could fool us that
easy. Why, even if he did manage to land wed soon hunt him out. But
hes built on that order, you see, and wont give up till the last horn
blows.

We know another fellow who often shows just the same stubborn nature,
chuckled Jack, without mentioning names either.

Now they had reached the two sailors, and as the boat drew alongside
they managed to reach the hands that were held down to assist them. So
they were dragged on to the lower deck, dripping wet, and looking as
though they hardly knew what they might expect afterwards.

Captain Shooks roared out an order, and at once the submarine started
after the man who was swimming toward the island, as best he could
with his clothes on. He kept on with gallant overhand strokes, and was
making quite fine progress. If left to his own devices there could be
little doubt he might have easily reached his goal, the island from
which his recent start had been made.

He acts like he was keeping tabs on us, all right, said Ballyhoo,
and means to dive to one side as soon as we get a certain distance
away.

And there he goes right now! added Jack, covering the spot with
his finder, and using his crank energetically to show the sudden
disappearance of the fugitive.

Captain Shooks seemed to be in a merry mood again.

Well give him all the chase he wants, he told the boys. I was
always said to be the most accommodating man alive. With those clothes
dragging him down, hes apt to throw up the sponge pretty soon. It
stands to reason he cant hold out long.
