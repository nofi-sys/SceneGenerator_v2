SCENE:
VIII
MOTHER AND CHILD


Come, darling, dinner is ready, and Mrs. Lucien held out her arms to
the tiny sprite who was busily engaged in pinning a scrap of torn lace
about a broken-nosed doll, her face a study in its eager intentness of
purpose.

O mamma, has we somefin nice? she exclaimed as her eyes fell on the
small table bearing the articles of food. Why tant we have oranges
every day?

My dear, mamma has not had money to buy them, but a good lady has given
mamma work to do, which brings money. Is not baby glad? Maybe we may
have good things to eat every meal, for Dolly, now. Mrs. Lucien kissed
the childs little face passionately, then turned away her own, lest the
tears should be seen that trembled in her lashes.

It was a mean little room, as Mrs. Wylie had said, only lighted by one
narrow window, but the taste of its simple furnishing accorded with the
faces of mother and child. Mrs. Luciens was one of those rare faces
seen only occasionally among the masses, purely oval, with soft outlines
and exquisite delicacy of expression. The eyes seemed to index the soul
in their spirituality and clearness. It seemed impossible to think of
guile or hypocrisy finding lodgment in the heart of a woman with such a
face. The tinge of melancholy resting upon it only added to its
attractiveness.

The child was the counterpart of the mother, even to the soulful eyes
and mobile lips. It was evident, as Mrs. Wylie had observed, that Mrs.
Lucien had seen better days. There was an unmistakable air of culture
and refinement in her manner, a dignity and grace of carriage that could
come only with one to the manner born. She appeared to be a stranger in
Forest City and was markedly uncommunicative as to her past life and
history in her intercourse with the few who sought further acquaintance
with her.

Mrs. St. John, on the second floor, had been attracted by her face, and
tried, through the child, to know more of her, but succeeded illy. The
child was as reserved as the mother, or had been kept in ignorance of
its history. One thing she noticed, it never spoke of its father, and
Mrs. St. John discreetly withdrew, and refrained from further
investigation.

There must be something wrong when people are so much afraid to let you
know anything of them, she reflected. She could not afford to risk her
own reputation by becoming associated with her.

Mrs. Wylie, too secure in worldly caste to be deterred by such
considerations, had a new interest, and would leave no means untried to
learn more of her protege.

She found she had an endless amount of sewing to be done, and made many
calls with reference to it, as well as necessitating much going to and
from her own rooms by Mrs. Lucien. And in all of those interviews the
little woman chatted away as blithely as though her caller were an
intimate friend instead of a stranger sewing woman, this being
characteristic of Elinor Wylie, and the outgrowth of her kindness of
heart, which neither fashion nor society, conventionality nor
worldliness could repress.

Mr. Wylie joked her daily upon her enthusiasm, which increased with
acquaintance.

She is entirely lovable, Horace, and entirely refined and cultured. I
have not her superior in my whole circle of acquaintances, she
reiterated one night, when he had chidden her for spending so much of
her time with Mrs. Lucien. If she were not so proud I should have
gotten her out of that dark little jail of a room before now, but I dare
not openly offer her charity. But, Horace, I have made a discovery. She
was formerly from New York, and she came here to be among strangers. I
suspect

Well, what do you suspect? said her husband, as she hesitated in her
speech.

WhyI half suspect she has run away from her husband, admitted Mrs.
Wylie reluctantly, hastening to add, I am quite sure she had a good
reason and that no blame can attach to her, whatever the cause.

Mr. Wylie shook his head.

Do not let your enthusiasm blind your eyes, Elinor. I give you credit
for being pretty keen-sighted usually, but a woman with such a history
may not be a desirable associate for my wife.

Horace! the blue eyes were raised reproachfully to his face. Even if
my suspicions are correct,and they are only suspicions,we may suppose
a case where she might be entirely blameless, and oh, so much more to be
pitied, because of these very circumstances which may cast a shadow over
her fair name! Surely she needs my friendship so much the more.
