SCENE:
The next few conversations she had with her husband, who got better
rapidly with the careful nursing he received, were after the same
pattern--a little wrangle, with taunts and sneers on his side, and
careless submission on hers, followed by a sort of tame reconciliation.
Before long she had managed, by a firm refusal to do anything which she
did not think good for him and a very gentle manner, to get the upper
hand of the obstinate invalid; and, when Mrs. Stanley had a tussle with
him on account of his unwillingness to have his wounds dressed or to
take his medicine at the proper hours, she always went to Annie to get
over the difficulty. Sometimes during a battle with the housekeeper he
would say:

Well, send Annie, then, and perhaps Ill have it done.

This flattering preference was received by its object with anything but
gratitude. To be called up from her sleep in the middle of the night,
or to be sent for in the course of a meal, because Mr. Harold says he
wont take any slops, maam, unless you come and see that his beef-tea
isnt hot enough to scald his throat, did not fill her with any pride
in this rise in her husbands esteem. At last, one night, when he was
fairly on the road to convalescence, she flatly refused to go when Mrs.
Stanley came to say Mr. Harold would not let her dress the wound on his
shoulder, but wanted his wife to do it.

Tell him I say you can do it much better than I, Mrs. Stanley; and,
if he wont let you do it, he must wait till to-morrow morning, said
the undutiful wife sleepily, as she turned over and shut her eyes again.

The next morning Harry, who was to go down-stairs for the first time
that day, bounced over on his side away from her as soon as she entered
his room and came up to the bedside. Annie walked softly toward the
door; then the invalid, who had recovered much of the power of his
lungs, roared:

Stop! Where are you going?

I am going to breakfast, said she, calmly.

Without even wishing me good-morning! After refusing point-blank just
to step along the corridor in the night when I might have been dying!
Youre a nice wife!

Now, look here, Harry; I dont pretend to do more than just my simple
duty to you, and dont for a moment set myself up for a model wife.

I should think not indeed! Everybody would laugh if you did.

Everybody would laugh, as you say, if I pretended to show any
affection for a husband so selfish that he will break a nights rest
of a very good nurse--I have been that, remember--on the most trifling
pretexts. I dare say you think it an honor to choose me instead of Mrs.
Stanley to put on a poultice or arrange a bandage; but I assure you it
is one I dont appreciate. You are nearly well now, and the task I set
myself of seeing you through your illness is over. My presence can only
irritate you now, and I think of taking the hint you have often given
me, and going to-day.

Go? What--leave me here all alone when Ive shown you I like to have
you near me? All right--go along then, you hard, heartless vixen! No,
no, he called, as she turned again toward the door--Annie, Annie, I
didnt mean it--Im not ungrateful--I have been selfish! Dont go till
Im quite well; dont leave me all alone, Annie, till I can get about
again! I like to hear your voice; and you move so quietly, and you talk
so prettily--Im always dull when youre out of the room--Im sorry
Ive been so cross. Dont go, Annie, till Im quite well. Wait till
next week. Wont you wait just till next week, Annie?

She came back to his side again, looking very grave.

Look here, Harry, she said; you are well enough now for me to speak
to you seriously, as I could not speak when you were lying there likely
to die. You have been very rude to me and ungracious, considering that
I came simply to do my best to get you well quickly. Now the duty
I set myself is over, and I assure you, strange as it may seem to
you, I feel no irresistible wish to stay here a moment longer than is
necessary. If you wish me to stay here still and do my best to amuse
you until you are strong enough to amuse yourself again, I will do so,
on one condition. It is that now you will drop the tone of childish
insolence to me which I have excused on account of your illness, and
speak to me as other men speak to their wives--no better than that,
she added, with a slight shade of irony.

So you want to preach and domineer over me, protested Harry, rather
sulkily, just because I said I didnt mind your being in the room.
Yes, yes, I will be civil, he added hastily, as Annies head moved
away; I didnt mean to be rude to you: I really am grateful for the
way you have taken care of me. Only dont speak to me in that hard
voice: just say something in your soft, pretty way, and I shall come
round directly. You always get over me when you speak in your soft
voice, you know.
