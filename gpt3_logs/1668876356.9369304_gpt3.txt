SCENE:
There was no sign behind of pursuit or a shadow. Fay took every
precaution. He approached the quays and the canals by lowland paths as
the sun dipped below the western sea-mist. He leaped a causeway, went
over a thin plank, and drew this ashore after him. The way ahead was
narrow. The way behind was closed to all save a good swimmer.

He came to a paved road beside which was a long row of tall poplars. A
windmill with crossed arms, like two combs on a pepper box, reared
toward the sea. Another showed beyond gray-stucco houses and lean barns.
The flat-green of Holland merged into a pea-soup fog which was rising.

A rusty steamer of the smaller class lay at a quay. Drifting smoke
poured from her one squat funnel. The gangplank was down. A stream of
stolid Dutch was mounting this plank. They seemed, in the gloom, like
cattle going to slaughter.

Fay found a boatman who was cleaning fish at the side of the canal. The
cracksman drew his coat around his thin shoulders and pointed toward the
steamer.

I want to go on that, he said.

The boatman laid down a fish-knife, tossed a fish into the bottom of the
boat, and rose with his scale-clustered hand to his cap.

Ein thaler, he said. I go with you over there for ein thaler.

Fay drew out four silver shillings and handed them down to the boatman.
He sprang to a thwart of the boat and waited as the fisherman got out
two clumsy oars, cast off the painter and shoved the boat from the edge
of the canal.

Hurry, said Fay, muffling his face in the stern of the boat.

The rower nodded and dipped the oars into the dark water. The boat
glided toward the ship. A voice called across the canal. Fay rose and
stared back over the course they had come. Muffled shadows moved on the
bank. A match was struck. This went out and left a flare still burning
in his eyes. He touched the boatmans shoulder.

Faster, he said. Row faster!

The boat reached the end of a rotting pier. Fay stretched his arms
upward, grasped a string-piece and lifted himself to the cross planks.

He did not glance at the boat or the boatman as he hurried ashore and
along the bank of the canal toward the quay where the ship was taking
aboard the cattle-like passengers. A horn blared the night as he reached
the gangplank.

He was one step advanced up this plank when a rattle and the thin honk
of an auto horn caused him to turn his head over his shoulder.

The rubberless and decrepit motor car from the hotel thrust a pair of
pale lights through the gloom. On the drivers seat of this car crouched
a chauffeur who was staring at his steaming radiator.

A woman, with her form hidden by a long coat and her face masked beneath
a broad-brimmed hat, sprang from the tonneau of the car, said something
to the driver in a low voice and hurried in the direction of the
gangplank.

Fay turned his head completely, grasped the handrail of the plank, and
stared at this woman. Her figure, even under the coat, was familiar to
him. He frowned slightly, let go his grip on the rail and backed down to
the quay.

You? he said almost bitterly as he reached the womans side. What are
you doing here, Saidee?

I came after you. Her face lifted under her hat. Her eyes were dark
and purposeful. The tightening of her lips drew down the corners of her
mouth.

You came after me. Seems as if everybodys coming after me. Im going
to take this boat.

No, youre not! Youre going back, after She half turned and stared
over the quay. Youre going back after the cipher, Chester, she said
in a whisper. Youre the only one who can get it. Come on with me. Her
gloved fingers pressed lightly on the sleeve of his coat. Her grip
became firmer. Please come, she added hastily. You havent any time
to lose. Youre not going awayfor my sake, Chester.

He tore loose her grip with an angry jerk. You, he said, are no
better than the othersMacKeenon, that hell-hound, and Sir Richard. Why
didnt you let me take the trick alone? I didnt need any help. Now the
job is queeredfor good. Im going to take this ship!

Oh, but Chester, youre not. Remember your promise?
