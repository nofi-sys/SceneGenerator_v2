What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
It is a great pity that she does not consult you more, said George
deferentially. Having no mother, she ought certainly to defer to you
as her representative.

That is just what I say! cried Mrs. Mansfield, growing confidential.
I have begged her to come and live here; the house is certainly
smaller than she is used to, but still its a home, and she would be
more comfortable, or she ought to be--this with some asperity--among
her own relations.

Certainly, said George, with conviction. He had just caught the sound
of children quarreling and screaming up-stairs, and his thoughts hardly
went with his words.

She might go backward and forward to town for her music-lessons from
here quite easily; and why should she not get daily pupils about here
as well as in town, if she has made up her mind to that? Then she would
have the comforts of a home to come to in the evening, and she might
amuse herself in her spare time by helping me to teach my own children.

It would be a delightful arrangement, said George, with fervor; then,
growing bold--And, as she is a nice, lady-like girl, I have no doubt
she would soon find a husband among her own friends.

Mrs. Mansfield shook her head, with her lips drawn tightly together.

I am sorry to say, Mr. Braithwaite, that Annie considers herself too
good for my friends. I dont wish to say anything against one of my own
blood; but I must say I dont think such high-and-mighty airs becoming.
It is not as if she was living now as she did when her father was
alive, and when nothing was too good for her.

Her father was well off, I believe?

Oh, yes; and, if he had been prudent, instead of spending heaps of
money upon her education, he would have left her a little to live upon!

It must be a hard change for her, though. She is so young, and of
course it is so natural to spoil a beautiful girl.

This rather rash speech caused Mrs. Mansfield to draw herself up.

Well, I cant say that I see her beauty myself! I dont say she is a
bad-looking girl; but I dont think her face is likely to do much for
her: and in my young days gentlemen looked for something more than a
pretty face in a wife, though to be sure they liked a pair of fine eyes
too!

George gathered from her manner of saying this that she judged her
own vacant, round, bead-like eyes to be handsome; and he smiled a
compliment, which brought a gratified but not becoming blush to her
particularly plain face.

Before long he succeeded in getting from her Miss Lanes address, in
one of the streets off Regent Street; and, pondering this choice of a
rather expensive locality, he left Mrs. Mansfields domestic paradise,
and returned to town. At his hotel he found the following telegram:

Come back at once. Sir George much worse. Harry has returned.

That night he was again at the Grange--not a minute too soon. They told
him, on his arrival, that his father was not expected to live till
morning, and he went straight up to the sickroom. Harry was there on
his knees by the bedside, very still and grave and unlike himself. Sir
George opened his eyes as his eldest son came in.

George, said he, with difficulty, I have forgiven him. Dont let it
be mentioned again. I cut him out of my will a week ago; it is too late
to alter it. Promise me to provide for him.

I promise, said George, in a low voice.

Call the rest. Its near now.

And they came one by one softly into the room. An old hound, a great
favorite of his, slipped in too, slunk up to the bed, and wagged his
tail at the master he had missed for days.

Hallo, Diamond, come to say good-bye to me?

And the hound, thus encouraged, licked his masters hand.

Have you forgotten the old days, Diamond? They are over for me as well
as for you now, my old beauty! Then, gathering a remnant of strength,
he gave a ringing View-halloo!

The hound bounded away in great excitement among the silent figures in
the room, then came back, and once more licked his masters hand. But
he got no answering caress, for the hand was still forever.
