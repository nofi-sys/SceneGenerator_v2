SCENE:
Saw the pretty little governess going to church; felt half inclined
to go too, just to look at her, he murmured once while she sat by his
bedside listening. But then he rambled off into talk which concerned
a dog he had bought, and Susan Green, the blacksmiths daughter,
and let fall some epithets which, it occurred to Annie, would apply
particularly well to Miss West, at whose house he and his companions
had been supping on the Wednesday night, or rather Thursday morning,
when she had run against him in Beckham Street, and when he had met
with his accident.

It was a hard punishment for the weakness of marrying him and the
fault of leaving him that she was suffering now, as she listened to
his wandering talk about other women, which showed his contempt for
a sex he did not understand, or think worth the trouble of trying to
understand. And all the while she had to try to overcome the disgust
with which he inspired her and the longing to be again in the society
of one man, one brilliant, interesting companion, for whom every word
she uttered had a charm, every action of hers was right.

When Mrs. Stanley took her place in the sickroom, she would fly like
an escaped bird out of doors, and wander through the fields and the
now leafless copses by herself, rejoicing in her temporary freedom,
trying to forget the horrible fact that she was married, and the very
existence of that unconscious, senseless clog upon her life that she
had left in the darkened room up-stairs. These rambles brought almost
as much pain as pleasure to her; they recalled to her so vividly
the long marauding expeditions she had had with William, when they
used to return home laden with birds eggs and ducks feathers, and
moss-covered twigs, all of which William had to carry as soon as they
got near the house, for fear any of the household should think that
Mrs. Harold Braithwaite was so childish as to care for such rubbish.
Harry had been merely an every-day trial then, to be shirked as much
as conscience permitted; now he had become, and by her own fault, an
obstacle to her happiness which there was no possibility of removing.

She had returned to the sickroom one afternoon to relieve the
housekeeper, and, finding that Harry was sleeping quietly--a fact which
made her a little nervous, as it proved he was getting better--she
opened a book and settled herself in an arm-chair by the fire, whence
she could see any movement of the invalids by merely raising her eyes.
The book was George Sands Consuelo. Opening it at first carelessly,
the earliest pages fixed her attention, and before long she bent over
it, completely absorbed in the fascinating story.

She did not see the sick mans eyes open, fall upon her, and remain
fixed, at first vacantly, then intently, upon her bent head. She did
not even notice the slight sound he made as he struggled to raise
himself on his elbow, nor the faint gasp of astonishment he gave
when, having succeeded, he had satisfied himself that it was his
long-forgotten wife.

Annie! he exclaimed, in a voice hoarse with weakness and with no
warmer emotion than amazement.

She looked up and said Harry! with just the same amount of tenderness.

Why are you here? he asked curiously, as he fell weakly back upon his
pillow.

Why, to nurse you, of course! said she in a soft voice, rising at
once without any noise or bustle, but in a quietly matter-of-fact
manner.

She came to the bed, arranged his pillow more comfortably, raised his
head, and gave him something to drink, while he stared at her silently
and received her attentions without any remark, until she quietly went
back again to her arm-chair and Consuelo. Still he gazed at her
fixedly, and, as she opened the book at the right place, which she had
been careful not to lose on hearing her husband address her for the
first time after nearly four years separation, he said:

Youve gone off shockingly!

Yes, I know I have, said Annie, quite calmly, putting her finger on
the line she had come to as she looked up. But you had better not talk
now, she added, coaxingly; it is very bad when you are still so weak.

Down went her head again; but, with characteristic tact, he insisted on
continuing:

I dont think I ever saw anybody so much altered. I suppose that is
why you have come back. You found nobody else would admire you any
longer, so it was time to come and saddle yourself on your husband.

Instead of being stung to the quick by this reproach, which was meant
to be very severe, Annie had some difficulty in repressing an impulse
to laugh; but she only said, soothingly:

It is all right, Harry; I am going away again as soon as ever you are
well. Ill turn away so--and she moved the chair round to face the
fire--and then you wont be annoyed by the sight of my ugly face.
