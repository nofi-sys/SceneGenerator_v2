SCENE:
III.


Of all the people who suffered, and were destined to suffer, from Jenny
Walcherens death, the heart that bled the most has been mentioned
the least, because it bled so silently and unobtrusively. Poor Mrs
Crampton! Who can estimate the depth and length and breadth of a
mothers love?

Whilst Mr Crampton had been noisily giving way to his indignation and
suspicions down at Dover, and Frederick Walcheren had been lapped in
despair, and Henry Hindes had been compelled to hide his dastardly
dread under an assumption of friendly concern, she had been bowed
beneath the weight of her sorrow at home. It was so hard to believe
it. Her Jenny!--whom she had never parted from since she was a little
baby at her breast. She sat passive, silent and incredulous, in her
darkened room, trying to realise that Jenny would never come home
again, except in her coffin. Her husband had wired her to say that he
and Mr Hindes would return on the Tuesday evening, bringing _that_ with
him, which was all that was left of their daughter. The poor, stricken
mother could not believe it. She tried to make herself do so. She kept
on talking to Aunt Clem about Jenny, of her childhood, her wilfulness,
and her beauty, but still the tears would not come, and the poor heart
was unrelieved.

I wish I could cry, Clem, she said pathetically, I wish I could cry;
but, whenever I think it is coming, a great, hard lump seems to rise in
my throat and drive it back again. I fancy I should feel better in my
head if I could cry. Talk to me, Clem, of when she was a little girl.

She was a sweet little girl, said poor Aunt Clem, mendaciously, a
little fond of her own way, perhaps, but very loving and obedient.

Oh! no, Clem, not obedient, I think, replied Mrs Crampton, but
always loving. I remember, when she was a baby, how I used to look
at her and wonder if she would ever grow up to be a woman. I had
lost so many of them, you see, Clem--five darlings buried, one after
another--until I was quite afraid to grow fond of a baby for fear it
should be taken from me. I can never forget those burials. They used
to tear my heart in two, and bury a piece of it every time. I went to
see the two first buried,--those were little John and Edmund, you know,
Clem; but, afterwards, I couldnt bear the sight. It seemed so hopeless
my having any children, until my Jenny came, so different from all the
others, who had been sickly little creatures; but she was so fat and
bonny that the doctor said to me, Well, youve got a thriving child
this time, Mrs Crampton. And yet it was many years, Clem, before
I dared to spend my whole love on her. I felt as if she were to go
too--that I must die. And yet you see she has gone, and I can sit and
talk about it to you, and do not even cry. It is very strange; I am
afraid there must be something wrong with my head, and she passed her
hand in a puzzled manner over her forehead as she spoke.

Oh! my dear sister, exclaimed Aunt Clem, whose own features were
almost indistinguishable from the effect of her tears, do try and cry.
I am sure it would do you good.

It has not done you any good, Clem, replied the poor mother.
Besides, we may expect her home at any moment now, and John has never
been very patient of my tears. I should not like to meet them--I mean
him--with my eyelids swollen. It might upset him. For we must be
very quiet over it, you know, Clem. It is a very solemn occasion. Is
everything ready for her reception?

Yes, dear; I have arranged they shall carry her into your boudoir. It
will make the room more dear to you afterwards, Ellen. Bradshaw helped
me to remove the ornaments and drape the tables in white, and decorate
the room with flowers. I think you will like it when you see it, dear.
At least, I have done my best.

I remember, said the mother, in a monotone, how averse I was to call
her Jane. John would have it so, because his sister Jane had only died
a month before her birth, but I thought it such a plain name. I had
set my heart upon calling her Ethel, after the heroine in Thackerays
story of the Newcomes, but her father said it was romantic nonsense on
my part, and he would have her nothing but plain Jane. But Mrs Sellon
stood godmother to her, so she was called Emily, also, after her. Ah,
well, with a heavy, deep-drawn out sigh, it doesnt signify now, does
it?

Hark! exclaimed Miss Bostock, changing colour, as the sound of
carriage wheels was heard slowly advancing up the drive. What is
that?

Mrs Crampton rose, trembling. They both knew but too well. It was the
funeral coaches which they heard, coming back from the station where
they had been ordered to await the nine oclock train.

Let me go! cried Mrs Crampton wildly, rousing herself from her
apparent apathy for the first time, let me go to my child, my Jenny. I
must be there to meet her.
