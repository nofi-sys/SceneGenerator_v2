SCENE:
XIII.


Before the company Annie had joined started on a tour, she had heard
more tidings to distress her about the Braithwaite family. It was
Aubrey Cooke who brought them this time. He was telling her that he had
met their late companion, Gerald Gibson, at Mrs. Falconers the day
before.

Oh! Do you know her too?

Yes; I have known her much longer than Gibson has. He and I have long
arguments about her.

I can guess which side you take.

I always take the part of a beautiful woman. And Gibson really does
her cruel injustice. She might sit for the portrait of the favorite
handsome panther-woman of the lady novelists.

I expected something more complimentary than that. I dont call that
high praise.

Dont you? Well, I dont know any pretty woman who would not feel
flattered at being called a panther; most of them only get as far as to
be like cats.

Now you are absolutely libelous! I know you will go on to say that
panthers are as cruel as they are graceful, that they delight in human
victims, and you might add, if you dared, that the pursuit of them was
an exciting sport. And then you will ask if the parallel does not hold
good.

Indeed, I shall say nothing so commonplace, Miss Langton. I always
maintain, to begin with, that beautiful women are not cruel. It is not
their fault if we crowd round them in such numbers that they mix us
up a little, and hurt our feelings by forgetting us. I have a great
advantage over most of my rivals in one respect--my appearance. I heard
a lady call me the other day the nice, quiet young man who looks so
stupid. She was asking a man named Colonel Richardson who I was.

Colonel Richardson?

Yes. He is a gentleman whom I always meet at Mrs. Falconers, a very
old friend of the family, I believe.

Now Aubrey Cooke had noted well, without appearing to remark it, the
expression of pain and anxiety which passed over Annies face as he
mentioned that Colonel Richardson was always at Mrs. Falconers. But
not having the least suspicion that she herself knew the popular
beauty, he misunderstood the cause of her distress, and connected it
with the fact of the meeting he and Gibson had seen a little way from
the stage-door some nights before; and he wondered whether she knew
that Colonel Richardson was married, and whether she had heard certain
old scandals connected with his name.

For the first few weeks of the tour Aubrey saw very little of Miss
Langton. She had taken his advice and drawn back, as civilly as she
could, from the proposal of living with Miss West, whom she soon found
out to be a coarse woman of not too reputable life, whose beauty and
a certain rough good-humor made her dangerous to many men. She saw
through the motive of Annies shyness at once, and said, with a laugh:

I suppose I am not good enough for you, little Puritan?

But she showed neither anger nor bitterness about it, and was
consistently kind, after her fashion, all the time the tour lasted,
to the quiet little girl to whom she had taken a capricious liking.
So that Annie could not help a sneaking liking for her, especially as
Miss West showed, in parts requiring dramatic power, a rough force
which in some scenes kept Annie spell-bound in the wings watching her,
and asking herself if this were not genius. And then Miss West would
destroy the illusion by coming off at the side, scolding the prompter
for not being at his post, and calling for stout or for brandy and
water.

Annie, therefore, chose to live alone, the only girl of her own
standing in the company being the amateur chambermaid, who was so
ostentatiously poor and aggressively economical that Miss Langton felt
that life with her would be a sort of voluntary martyrdom.

She had some trials with lazy landladies, extortionate landladies,
maids-of-all-work who did not give her enough attention, and others
who gave her too much. They had been traveling some weeks, when, in a
certain town which is one of the oldest in England, she got into some
lodgings where the landlady was always out, and, being a lone widow who
kept no servant, sometimes left her lodgers to wait upon themselves
more than was meet.

Aubrey Cooke had rooms above Annies in this house, and, on reaching
the door, tired, hot, and hungry after a long rehearsal of a piece
which had just been added to their repertory, Annie found her
fellow-lodger kicking the paint viciously off the inhospitable portal.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Annie is a young woman who has recently joined a touring theater company. She is shy and doesn't want to live with the other members of the company, so she chooses to live alone. She has some trials with her lodgings, but the worst is when she arrives at a new town and finds that her landlady is always out and doesn't provide any services.
Aubrey Cooke, another member of the company, lives in the same building and is also having trouble with the landlady. He is tired and hungry after a long rehearsal when he runs into Annie. They commiserate with each other about the state of their lodgings and then go upstairs to their respective rooms.
