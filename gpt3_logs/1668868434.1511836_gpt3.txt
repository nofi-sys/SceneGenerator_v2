Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Leaving Rob he crossed the narrow stream and knocking upon the door
exchanged some words with a woman who opened it.  But to all that he
said she only shook her head, and he returned somewhat discomfited.

"She says that Invernenty is not at home," he said, calling him by
the name of his place, "and yet I am doubting her unless he is taken."

Without delay they set their camp, and during the day several
Macgregors came over and eyed them secretly, red men in a red
tartan--querulous, hot-blooded fellows.

Rob, ill at ease in a strange country, kept in the background, but in
the afternoon seeing a great crowd of them gathered about a place up
the glen he accompanied Gloom, being wearied of sitting alone.

The Macgregors with a sprinkling of Maclarens were handling a curious
smooth stone with holes for a finger and a thumb, and competing with
one another in lifting it upon a small rock that stood in close
proximity.

A tall dark sombre-looking man leaning upon a rude crutch and with a
pale harassed face was regarding the scene from a little distance.
He was dressed in riding clothes and with a greatcoat buttoned up
closely as though he were ill.  Rob was on the point of asking who he
was when he became aware of the other's close scrutiny.

There was something dangerously interested in the manner he
stared--taking him in with his dark cunning eyes, measuring his
height in his mind--the set of his face, conjuring up every detail
circumspectly.

"Gloom," said Rob in a whisper, "there's a man up on the brae has a
notion who I am."

Very casually the gipsy turned about.

"Misfortune take it," he murmured, "but it is James More, son of Rob
Roy, new come from Culloden.  He was wounded, ye mind."

Presently without a word or any sign James Macgregor moved painfully
away and entered Inverlochlarig.

"Come, Rob," said Gloom, "I would not trust that man a foot.  He is
up to mischief, and it's like enough we were better over Glenbucket
than here."

Evening drew on, but there was no sign of trouble.  At the rising of
the moon, however, a tall gaunt woman with a plaid over her head
asked for a word with the gipsy.  They went apart together and
conferred in low tones.  And then as silently as she had come the
woman vanished into the shadows.

"Rob," said Gloom, "there's danger threatening--when was there not in
this wild country?  Who do you think that was?"

Rob shook his head.

"Who but John Maclaren himself, new come from giving the red-coats
the go-bye on the road to Carlisle.  He says James is up to his
pranks, and that the clan are scared to death at the very sight of
you in the heart of their country.  It is away we must go, Rob," and
summoning his men they prepared to set out, leaving their camp fires
burning in case their flight was suspected.  Over the cleft in the
hills they went, and crossing the top of Beinn-an-Shithein, came down
on Strathyre and Castle Murdoch.

"There is a strange man lives there," said the gipsy to Rob, "it's
like enough he will send us about our business should we stop."

"Who are ye?" snarled a voice at that moment from the wall of the
place, "ye canna bide hereabouts."

The moon had risen and under its clear rays Rob looked up and saw a
white-haired man watching them from the rampart.

"What kind of night skulking is this?" he cried.

"I am Gloom," replied the gipsy.

"And who is that with you, he is none of your people."

"He is a friend, Murdoch."

"Bring him here--this is an ill time for friends," and he disappeared.

A few minutes later they saw him crossing the courtyard, a lamp
swinging in his hand, limping through a shortness of his right leg,
and frowning at them as he peered through the shattered iron gates.

"Come nearer," he rasped, "you boy there with the borrowed claes."


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Rob, a young man, is in the company of a gipsy named Gloom. They are in the Highlands of Scotland, and have just come across a stream. They knock on the door of a woman's house, and Rob asks her if Invernenty is home. The woman says he is not, and Rob is suspicious.
The gipsy and the young man set up camp, and during the day, several Macgregors come and stare at them. In the afternoon, Rob goes with Gloom to see what the Macgregors are up to.
They are handling a smooth stone with holes for fingers, and trying to lift it onto a small rock. Rob sees a tall, dark man watching them from a distance, and he is sure the man knows who he is. The man is James More, son of Rob Roy, and he is new from Culloden.
Later, a tall, gaunt woman comes to speak to Gloom in private. She is John Maclaren, and she tells him that James is up to his old tricks and the clan is scared of Rob.
Gloom decides they must leave, and they pack up their camp and head for Strathyre. As they approach Castle Murdoch, a man's voice calls out to them, asking who they are. It is Murdoch, the owner of the castle.
Murdoch invites them in, and they follow him into the courtyard. He is a white-haired man with a limp, and he tells them they are not welcome there.
