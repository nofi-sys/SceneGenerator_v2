SCENE:
XVIII

Afloat Again


Back to camp tramped these two brothers, the one in a torn suit of
underwear, the other fully dressed, but both wearing wide grins.

They were both happy--recklessly so. All things dwindled into
insignificance except the fact that they were together
again--together, after a night of terror. The cattle of Whirlpool
River Ranch--The Pup--the reported landslide--all these were for the
moment forgotten. They would return later, with their
responsibilities. But now, for Teddy and Roy, there was happiness
where they had feared to find sorrow.

Their tremendous relief was not the sort that is communicated by
words. A firm handclasp, an arm thrown carelessly around the
shoulders, speaks louder than any well-turned sentence. Thus it was
that on that journey back to their camp there was little said
besides Pops interminable: Snakes! and Roys: Ill tell a
maverick! whenever Teddy made a statement.

Roys story was soon told. Pop marveled much and examined the boys
wounds with care, treating them with the antiseptic they had brought
along. When Roys tale was finished, Teddy sprang his bit of news.

We found the canoe!

Roys eyes opened wide.

You mean to say there is anything left of it?

Sure, there is! Bug Eye exclaimed. We can fix her up in no time!
Shes got quite a hole in her, but Pop can mend that. Hey, Pop?

Betcher boots, the veteran rancher replied, as he grinned. I am
one grand little fixer. Lets take another look at it.

Roy, clothed in assembled finery, as Bug Eye said, was delighted
when he saw that the craft was not irreparably damaged. It had been
washed ashore a short distance below the rock, and, aside from the
hole in the stern, it was as good as ever.

Guess dadll be at Jake Trummers by now, Teddy declared. But
well soon have the old boat on the way. Give your orders, Pop! You
can be the boss carpenter. What do we do first?

Get out that strip of canvas, Pop suggested. Wheres yore knife,
Roy? Snakes, you aint washed it yet! He took it from the boy and
looked at it silently. Darkening the blades was dried blood--the
blood of the eagle. Sticking to the blade were a few tiny, grey
feathers. Pop held it in the palm of his hand and nodded his head
slowly.

Theres not many knives that can say they killed an eagle, he said
musingly. Thisll make a great token, Roy. Then his voice took on
a businesslike tone again. The incident was over. The chapter
closed. Pop bent down, inserted the blade in the canvas, and drew it
along with a ripping sound.

Soon all four were deep in their task. The hole had to be well
mended, as the rapids were still ahead of them and the rocks would
search hungrily for a weak spot on which to fasten their needle-like
fingers. Pop went about the job slowly and deliberately, and it was
afternoon before it was finished to his satisfaction.

Might as well eat, Bug Eye said as he straightened up and threw
his shoulders back to get the kinks out. Somehow I never did get
over that there habit. So you had roast porcupine this morning, Roy?
Well, we cant promise you that, but we have got some pork an beans
left unless Pop eat em all. You feel all right now, Roy?

Sure I do! The boy flexed his muscles. Those cuts have stiffened
up a little, but theyll soon work out. Yea, Bug Eye, I feel great!
Im mighty hungry, though.

You can do the paddlin, Teddy remarked with a grin. And if you
see a rock, duck!

Unconsciously the boys healthy mind was bringing to the fore the
events of that fear-ridden night just passed, and instead of hiding
them deep in the recesses of the subconscious, later to emerge as
tangled emotions, Teddy was baring them and destroying their power
to haunt. Of course he did not realize all this. He knew only that
an unpleasant experience cannot be forcibly forgotten--that it must
be aired, shaken, and dry-cleaned.

But now, his eyes seemed still to hold some of the terror of last
night when he had thought that his brother was killed. Roy had had
other emotions to occupy his mind--pain, amazement, and
self-preservation. Teddy had had nothing--nothing but an
overpowering dread that increased hourly until, when dawn had come,
it seemed to permeate his whole being, sickening him.
