SCENE:
II

THE PLAN


When did you land? Why didnt you let us know? How long are you
going to stay? Did your father come too? Wheres Billy Potter?
Hows Dr. Pierce? And Oh how youve grown!

Maida tried to answer them all; to hug each of the girls who were
hugging her all together; to hold out a hand to each of the three boys
who seemed all to shake both her hands at once; to manage to kiss Betsy
Hale, who hearing the name Maida shouted, vaguely recalled that there
had once been a Maida whom she loved; and who thereupon, hung tight to
one of her legs; to manage to kiss Delia Dore who had no remembrance
of Maida whatever but in imitation of Betsy, hung tight to the other
leg; and in addition to call to Molly and Timmie and Dorothy and Mabel
who remembered her perfectly and who danced like little wild Indians on
the outskirts of the crowd, yelling, Maidas come back! Maidas come
back! at the top of their lungs.

All this took much less time to happen than it has taken to describe,
and it was suddenly interrupted by the rapid opening of the door to the
Dore yard. A little old Irish woman with silvery hair and with a face
as wrinkled as a nut, came rushing out, her arms extended calling, My
lambs come back! My lambs come back!

Maida ran to her and hugged her ecstatically. Oh, dear Granny Flynn!
she said, Dear, dear Granny Flynn!

Then there appeared back of Granny Flynn, Mrs. Dore--Granny Flynns
daughter; Delia and Dicky Dores mother--who had to be met in the same
affectionate way. Mrs. Dore was a tall, brown, fresh-complexioned
woman. It was from her that Dicky inherited his brown coloring and
Delia her sparkling expression.

Id never know you for the same child, Mrs. Dore said.

Of course the grown people claimed Maidas attention first. They
showered her with questions and she answered them every one with all
her old-time courtesy and consideration. Was she well? Well! But look
at her! When did she land? She had landed the day before in New York;
had come on the midnight to Boston. Where was she living? At their
home on Beacon Street. Would she stay to lunch? Yes! Yes! _Yes!_ Her
father had said that if she were invited, she could spend the whole
rest of the day in Primrose Court; he would send the car for her late
in the afternoon. Where was she going after that? Her father would tell
them all this afternoon. He had some plans, but they werent worked
out yet. Would she be in Boston for a few days? Probably. Then, during
that time, wouldnt she like to come back to her own rooms over MAIDAS
LITTLE SHOP? _Would she?_ Oh goody, she could telephone her father to
bring her some clothes.... It went on and on until the older children
stood first on one foot and then on the other with impatience; and the
younger ones went back to their house-keeping game and their frequent
punishments.

But finally the curiosity of this group of grown-ups was satisfied and
the children claimed their prey. A clamorous group--every one of them
telling her some bit of news and all at once--they made the tour of the
Court. They called on Mrs. Lathrop, who mercifully forebore to ask more
than five minutes of questions; and on the Misses Allison, a pair of
middle-aged maiden ladies. Here the confusion doubled itself because
of the noisy screams of Tony the parrot.

Tony kept calling at the top of his croaking voice, Whats this all
about? Each of the children tried to tell him, but he was apparently
dissatisfied with their explanations; for he only called the louder and
with greater emphasis, I _say_--_what_ is this all about? Finally, in
despair he exclaimed, Good-night, sweet dreams, and subsided.

At length, the six of them--Maida, Rosie, Laura, Arthur, Dicky and
Harold--retired to the Lathrop lawn and plumped down on the grass. They
talked and talked and talked....

How you have grown, Maida! Rosie said first. How tall you are and
strong-looking! She would have added, And how pretty! if the boys
had not been there, but shyness kept her from making so personal a
comment in their presence.

Thats exactly what I was thinking about you, Maida laughed, but
then you have all grown, Arthur particularly. In her candid, friendly
way, she surveyed them, one after another. You are taller too, Laura,
and I believe even your hair has grown.

It certainly has, Laura admitted. Lauras hair was extraordinarily
long and thick. It hung in two light-brown braids, very glossy, not a
hair out of place, to below Lauras waist. At the tip of each braid was
a big pale blue bow.

As for you, Rosie, you are still taller than I, Im afraid.
