SCENE:
She had stopped, seeing it was of no use to try to argue with him in
this mood, and that to disobey him would only be to see him break
his neck before her eyes. And she drove home full of remorse, after
watching him vault over a gate to take a short cut to the village, and
making one more effort to stop him by a piteous cry of Harry! of
which he took no notice.

To the blacksmiths--where Susan Green lived! This, then, was the end
of his revived affection for herself, that the very first walk he took
led him straight back to the vulgar charms of the blacksmiths daughter.

It was a bitter, unpleasant thought, even for a wife not sufficiently
fond of her husband to be jealous. It was a humiliation which brought
up in her mind the image of the one man who thought her charms superior
to those of any other woman. She did not feel jealous, but insulted by
the rude speech of her husband, who, after she had used every care,
every charm at her command to fulfill her duty to him in sickness
and in convalescence, rewarded her with a coarse taunt and an openly
expressed intention of leaving her for the society of a girl of low
birth and not unspotted name.

She drove home, and, as soon as she had taken off her hat and mantle,
went into the library, where, in spite of Harrys rough prohibition,
she still continued to give William lessons in French. Dusk was coming
on; but it was light enough for her to see the figure bending over a
book in a low chair near the window. She crossed the room and put her
hand on his shoulder.

William, how wrong of you to try your eyes like that.

He looked up. It was not William, but Harry.

You, Harry? murmured his wife, in astonishment.

Yes, me--Harry. I may try my eyes as much as I like, maynt I?

She took the book gently from his hand. It was Sartor Resartus.

You have not been reading this? she gasped.

Yes, I have. I saw it lying on the table with your book-marker in it,
so I took it up to see what it was like; and Ive read six pages, but
Ill be hanged if I can make head or tail of it!

Nor can I, said Annie.

Well, what do you read it for then?

She hesitated.

It was written by a great man, a mighty thinker, and I like to try
to find out what he means.

Well, I think it is a very dull amusement. Thomas Carlyle--looking
at the title page. Mighty thinker, you say. Ive heard of a mighty
hunter----

Oh, you are thinking of Nimrod! Its not the same person, said Annie.

You are laughing at me! Very well!

Yes, I am, said Annie, smiling, and putting her arms affectionately
round his neck. But I think, if I didnt laugh, I should cry--I feel
very much touched by finding you--finding you here trying to read my
dull books when I was feeling very angry with you for running away from
me as you did.

Harry rubbed his curly head against her responsively without saying
anything for a minute. Then he looked up searchingly into her face.

Annie, I want to ask you something. Just now Ste--some one told me
they had seen Colonel Richardson in Beckham several times during the
last few days, and had seen you talking to him.

Well?

Well!--sharply. And why didnt you say anything about it?

There was nothing to say. I met Colonel Richardson, I spoke to him,
and that was all. What is there strange in that?

Oh, nothing, of course! He paused for a moment and looked away
from her. Then he burst out, but as if to himself: It was Colonel
Richardson who came dangling after you four years ago. You always liked
him.

Harry, dont be so absurd as to be jealous of Colonel Richardson!
Indeed you have never had the slightest cause to be so.

How can I be sure of that? said he, turning upon her suddenly. One
thing I am certain of--that is, that, during these four years that you
have been away from me, you have met somebody you liked better than
me. I dont say it was unnatural--I dont say Im surprised; but I say
that I know Im right, and Ill find out who it is, as sure as Im your
husband! You say Ive no need to be jealous of any actor--and I dont
myself think you would lower yourself as far as that----
