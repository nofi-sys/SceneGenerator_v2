SCENE:
IV
A FIGHT ON MARKET DAY

When the door had closed upon them, Juana buried her face in her hands.

Oh, what misery I bring everywhere, she sobbed. To my father and
mother I brought death and now to you all and to Jim and Mollie I am
bringing ruin and perhaps death also. But it shall not beyou shall not
suffer for me! He looked straight at you, Julian, when he made his
threat. What could he mean to do? You have done nothing. But you need
not fear. I know how I may undo the harm I have so innocently done.

We tried to assure her that we did not carethat we would protect her
as best we could and that she must not feel that she had brought any
greater burden upon us than we already carried; but she only shook her
head and at last asked me to take her home to Mollies.

She was very quiet all the way back, though I did my best to cheer her
up.

He cannot make you work for him, I insisted. Even The Twentyfour,
rotten as it is, would never dare enforce such an order. We are not yet
entirely slaves.

But I am afraid that he will find a way, she replied, through you, my
friend. I saw him look at you and it was a very ugly look.

I do not fear, I said.

I fear for you. No, it shall not be! She spoke with such vehement
finality that she almost startled me, and then she bade me good night
and went in to Mollies house and closed the door.

All the way back home I was much worried about her, for I did not like
to see her unhappy.

As I approached the house I saw that the candle was still burning in the
living roomI had left so hurriedly that I had given it no thoughtand
as I came closer I saw something else, too. I was walking very slowly,
and in the soft dust of the pathway my soft boots made no sound, or I
might not have seen what I did seetwo figures, close in the shadow of
the wall, peering through one of our little windows into the living
room.

I crept stealthily forward until I was close enough to see that one was
in the uniform of a Kash Guard while the other was clothed as are those
of my class, and in the latter I recognized the stoop-shouldered, lanky
figure of Peter Johansen. I was not at all surprised at this
confirmation of my suspicions.

I knew what they were there forhoping to learn the secret hiding place
of The Flagbut I also knew that unless they already knew it, there was
no danger of their discovering it from the outside since The Flag had
been removed from its hiding place. So I hid and watched them for
awhile, and then circled the house and entered from the front as though
I did not know they were there, for it would never do to let them know
that they had been discovered.

Taking off my clothes I went to bed, after putting out the candle. I do
not know how long they remainedit was enough to know that we were
being watched, and though it was not pleasant I was glad that we were
forewarned. In the morning I told Father and Mother what I had seen.
Mother sighed and shook her head.

It is coming, she said. I always knew that sooner or later it would
come. One by one they get usnow it is our turn.

It was market day, and I went in with a few wethers, some hides and
cheese. Father did not come alongin fact, I advised him not to as Soor
would be there and also Hoffmeyer. One cheese I took as tribute to Soor.
God, how I hated to do it! But both Mother and Father thought it best to
propitiate the fellow, and I suppose they were right. A lifetime of
suffering does not incline one to seek further trouble.

The market place was full, for I was a little late. There were many Kash
Guards in evidencemore than usual. It was a warm daythe first really
warm day we had hadand a number of men were sitting beneath a canopy
at one side of the market place in front of Hoffmeyers office. As I
approached I saw that Or-tis was there, as well as Pthav the coal baron,
and Hoffmeyer of course, with several others, including some Kalkar
women and children. I recognized Pthavs womana renegade Yank who had
gone to him willinglyand their little child, a girl of about six. The
latter was playing in the dust in front of the canopy some hundred feet
from the group, and I had scarcely recognized her when I saw that which
made my heart almost stop beating for an instant.

Two men were driving a small bunch of cattle into the market place upon
the other side of the canopy when suddenly I saw one of the creatures, a
great bull, break away from the herd and with lowered head charge toward
the tiny figure playing, unconscious of danger, in the dust. The men
tried to head the beast off but their efforts were futile. Those under
the canopy saw the childs danger at the same time that I did, and they
rose and cried aloud in warning. Pthavs woman shrieked and Or-tis
yelled lustily for the Kash Guard; but none hastened in the path of the
infuriated beast to the rescue of the child.
