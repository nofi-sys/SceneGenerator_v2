SCENE:
One thing I hope is that you dont happen to run across a man-eating
shark while youre down below, Ballyhoo went on to say, with a
shudder; for he could not forget the close call he himself had passed
through. We saw a whopping big pirate swimming around, you remember,
when we were hunting for the wreck; besides that pair we watched
scrapping.

Apparently what he said did not deter Oscar in the least. He had
learned just the course he must pursue in case a shark did come around,
and act as though too curious regarding the unwieldy creature prowling
about the wreck. And both divers had assured him there was little need
of anxiety.

So presently he started over the side of the float. The sun was just
about an hour above the western horizon, so that he would not have any
great amount of time to do his looking about.

It was a queer feeling that assailed the boy when the sea waters closed
over his head, and he continued to descend step by step, following the
ladder down into the depths.

Presently he reached the terminus of the structure. When he lowered
his foot again it encountered only empty space. Thereupon he gave the
signal to those on the float that he was about to swing off, after
which he lowered himself, making use of his hands upon each round until
in the end he was being sustained simply by the life line.

Down he continued to go foot after foot, with more or less of a rotary
motion. When it seemed as though he must have descended dozens of
yards, all at once Oscar discovered by the aid of the faint light
penetrating to those depths that he was hovering over a patch of the
waving greenish white growth that could pass under the name of sea
ferns.

Another few seconds and he felt his feet strike the ground. Here his
first duty was to straighten out the lines, so that his pipe might not
get foul, cutting off the flow of fresh air that was being pumped down
to him from the raft. After that he commenced to look around, using the
electric torch, which had been placed in his hand before the start.

Before him in one particular quarter he discovered a dim object rearing
up, and which he realized must be the long sought hulk of the ancient
galleon. Toward this he immediately proceeded, trying to remember the
distinct directions given by the divers, by following which he would
most likely save himself considerable trouble in gaining entrance to
the old vessel.

Now he was clambering up the sloping deck, taking advantage of the
several devices which those experienced campaigners had arranged to
facilitate this entry, knowing how often it must be repeated in the
course of their labors.

Then the yawning cavity lay before him, being what at one time had
stood for the companionway, by means of which the cabin under the
stern deck of the ship could be reached. Time and the action of the
waters in these cycles of years had demolished parts of the original
superstructure of the ship, so that it was difficult to tell just what
parts of it still remained intact. But having been coached by the
divers, Oscar felt sure of his ground.

He looked carefully about him, first of all. This was partly to
familiarize himself with his surroundings, so that he might not by any
accident get lost while carrying out his investigations. After that he
boldly swung himself loose, and commenced to drop into the interior of
the vessel.

It was always necessary to drag his air hose after him, and be very
vigilant in order to make sure that no injury befell the same; also to
see that the life line did not become entangled so that if he suddenly
needed either to send a signal up or be drawn forth bodily himself
there would be nothing to interfere.

He saw many things, but nothing of an awe-inspiring nature. Doubtless
there may have been ghastly reminders of the tragedy that had overtaken
the treasure-ship, but the ceaseless eddying of the water to and fro,
in and out of the wreck, had long ago hidden them from view.

Oscar had figured on enlarging upon the plan spoken of by the diver.
He believed that the oscillation of the hulk would gradually move
the heavy ingots of precious metal in a certain general direction.
Accordingly, he kept continually on the watch to find the three stones
piled on top of one another in the shape of a cairn, or marking spot.

When presently he discovered this, he knew he was on the right track.
After that it was only necessary for him to keep pushing ahead,
entering upon the region that, owing to lack of time, the diver had not
yet explored.

Then he tripped over something that felt solid. Hastily turning the
soft glow of his waterproof electric torch down, what was his joy to
find that his suspicions were confirmed, and that he had actually come
upon another of those brick-like objects for which they were searching.
