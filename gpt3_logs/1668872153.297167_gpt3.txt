SCENE:
"No offence taken, I assure you," she rejoined, smiling. "Monsieur
Vignerte is a true scholar, and will tell you that the very best
libraries are those to which admission is most difficult. Isn't that so,
Herr Beck?" She added, turning to the old savant, who had just arrived
and was lost in astonishment at the troops concentrated at the two ends
of the parade-ground.

I admired the surpassing skill with which she turned a conversation
verging on delicate ground.

"You are unquestionably right, Frulein," my old colleague hastened to
reply, with the utter ingenuousness of the man of learning. "Monsieur
Vignerte knows only too well that the whole library, manuscripts
included, is at his disposal."

"Hush!" said Frulein von Graffenfried, turning round. "Here's the
King."

A group of horsemen bad just appeared opposite us, on the other side of
the square, in the courtyard of the castle. There was immediately a
volley of sharp commands. Cavalry and infantry stiffened to attention.
With a noise like sheets of metal tearing, bayonets were fixed to the
muzzles of rifles. Three thousand swords flashed out, three thousand
tongues of lightning.

Trumpets and fifes began a slow march, a kind of summons to arms, very
sharp and strident, but quite in keeping with the keen December morning.
When it stopped, there burst out one wild universal cheer, solid,
raucous and prolonged, like the roll of a wave which never breaks.

The little group of horsemen advanced at the trot in the huge empty
square. The King of Wrtemberg, in field-marshal's uniform, was in
front on a black horse. On his right was the Grand Duke
Frederick-Augustus, in general's uniform, very plain. On his left
General von Eichhorn displayed all the glories of the Great General
Staff. Close by was young Duke Joachim, looking very well in the blue
tunic of a lieutenant in the Detmold Dragoons.

Behind them came a display of the finest uniforms in the German Army: a
colossal officer of the White Cuirassiers; an officer of the Guard
Artillery in black and gold with crimson facings; grey Hussars, a green
Uhlan.

"Where's the Grand Duchess?" I murmured to Marais.

"What! You call yourself an officer of the Reserve! Where do you expect
to find the colonel at a review? At the head of his regiment, of course.
Look, there's Colonel von Mudra of the 182nd. The review begins with his
regiment. He's the man just in front of the Staff. He will drop back
into line when his unit has been inspected."

At a gallop the Royal group passed between the companies of the
regiment, which smartly opened out for the manuvre. The white and
black standards were lowered at their passage. Then came a sharp order
and the ranks closed up. It was the turn of the Detmold Dragoons.

Colonel von Becker, slim and straight, a fine figure in his blue tunic,
white gauntlets and black-spiked helmet with its silver eagle, rode up
to the King, whom he saluted with a broad sweep of his sabre, presenting
to him his superb regiment, a host of giants on motionless giant steeds.
This solid mass gave me such an impression of overwhelming force that I
involuntarily pressed Marais' hand.

"H'm!" he murmured. "Our Cuirassiers and Spahis will have their work cut
out if it ever comes."

An order, passed down by the commanding officers, captains and
lieutenants, and the earth trembled beneath the hoofs of the 11th
Detmold Dragoons moving off by the right, behind the 182nd Infantry, to
take its place for the march past.

It was Marais' turn to press my arm.

"Look!" he said.

In front of us, in the first row, Frulein Melusine von Graffenfried
was leaning over the rail with a smile on her lips. Two riders were
advancing towards the King. One was little Hagen, rather pale and
plainly fall of himself. He was riding eight or ten paces behind the
Colonel of the Lautenburg Hussars.

To tell the truth, I could not clearly distinguish the features of the
Grand Duchess Aurora. I could only see the outline of her slight form.

She was walking a little horse gorgeously caparisoned. Above her riding
skirt was the tunic of the Lautenburg Hussars, red with orange facings.
Her black kolbach reared its long gold cockade above her head.

She also presented arms to the King of Wrtemberg, who, urging his
horse forward, bowed over her hand and kissed it. A tremendous cheer
went up from the crowd:
