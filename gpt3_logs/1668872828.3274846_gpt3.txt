Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
XI.

CARRIED BY STORM.

You call it an ill angelit may be so;
But sure am I, among the ranks that fell
Tis the first _fiend_ eer counselled man to rise!
ANON.


Manton had reckoned without his host, in supposing that his
self-constituted patroness had any idea whatever of being frozen off:
on the contrary, her benevolent ardor had been only warmed still more,
as he had abundant evidence, when, on returning from his office next
morning, he found yet another snowy missive crowning the centre of his
table.

Monsieur Tonson, come again! he exclaimed, as he seized the note, and
opened it this time without hesitation, what can the incredible woman
have to say now? Well, here it is!

MY FRIENDYou heaped ice upon my heart yesterday. To-day, I feel
chilled and stiffened, as if my very soul-wings had been frosted
through your lips! Why did you do so? It was not magnanimous in you.
_You_ are proud, and beautiful, and strong, while I am plain, and
weak, and lowly. Was it worthy of a noble soul to treat with such
harsh and cutting coldness a poor, feeble, and wayworn daughter of
sorrow like myself, who had come merely in the meek and matronly
overflow of tenderness and appreciation for a poisoned, sick and
erring child of genius, to offer him her sympathy in his dreary and
unrelieved immolation of glorious powers at the unholy altar of
ambition? Was it not unkind of you? Can you suppose that had you
not been poisoned, body and soul, the demon pride would have thus
overruled your better and your angel nature to such harsh rejection
of the comforter, the Father had sent you in his mercy? What have I
asked of you, but that you should unbend this fatal pride, and accept
of mortal genialities? That you should spare yourself from yourself,
and give something to others. Ah! you will not always thus repulse the
sympathies of your racenaughty, naughty boy! hasten to be good and
come to see me!
MARIE.

Well! well! by heaven, the audacity of this thing soars to the
sublime! and yet there is some truth as well as pathos in it, too! Now,
I come to think of it, it was unmanly of me to treat the poor woman
so, just as if I expected she carried stilettoes or revolvers under
her petticoats, or wore aromatic poison in her bosom, with a foul and
treacherous design upon my life! The fact is, I have made a bugbear of
this creature in my imagination, when she is nothing, in fact, but fool
and fanatic combined, with a little disjointed mother-wit. Curse the
whole affair! I wish she and her endless letters were in the bottom of
the sea! By these persistent impertinences she disturbs me in my work;
these distractions are unendurable! I wish she were only safe in heaven.

It is useless to give _all_ the letters which poor Manton received
within the next four or five days, but it is sufficient to say that at
last, in a fit of veritable desperation, spleen and humor, he answered
one of the last in a tone of hyperbolical exaggeration that would have
put to shame, not Mercutio only, but the veritable Bombastes Furioso
himself. The effect was coldly studied, and behold the result.

The next morning a servant informed him that a lady desired to see him
in the parlor.

Terror-stricken by the announcement, he nevertheless knew, in his
conscience, that he had brought down the judgment upon his own head. He
therefore felt it to be his duty to abide the consequences of his own
imprudence, and went down to wait upon his caller, who, of course, was
no other than his correspondent.

She received him with a flushing face, as seemed to be usual to her
shrinking nature. She was this time without her daughter. There
were other persons in the parlor, and this seemed to disconcert her
somewhat, for she had evidently come full of some important disclosure.
Although it was the latter part of winter, and a heavy snow had just
commenced breaking up, which rendered the streets of New York almost
impassable, she nevertheless proposed that they should go out for a
long walk. Manton looked through the window into the sloppy street,
opened his eyes a little, and assented.

There was something wonderfully rare in the idea of a womans proposing
a long walk on such a day, and Manton relished the hardiness and
originality of the thing.

Well! said he to himself, I like her spunk, anyhow! She has shown
herself in every way to be in earnest in what she undertakes. Phew!
I shall enjoy it! a woman in long petticoats, wading a mile or two
through a cold slush such as this! After this, what is it that Madame
wont do? Ill lead her something of a round, at any rate, before she
gets back.
