SCENE:
VIII.

Raggetts Terms.


Under the guidance of Lieutenant Fotheringay the prisoners were
taken through the frigate. They expressed their admiration in
unstinted language. Fotheringay told them that Raggett was a strict
disciplinarian who insisted that his crew should always be in
first-class condition for work. He was unforgiving when any of his men
wilfully neglected duty; but when work was over and playtime arrived,
he never interfered with the manner in which the seamen enjoyed
themselves. He had closed his eyes to their frolics in Provincetown,
where they sometimes made merry with great vigor, and now that shore
leave was suspended he demanded implicit obedience to his order
requiring special permission from himself for any of his crew to visit
the town.

To the prisoners all this emphasized the change of front on the British
side. Raggett evidently meant what he said when he told them he was
going to obey orders. Already the Nymph and the Bulwark, of the
squadron blockading Cape Cod bay, were watching the coast between
Barnstable and Boston. The Spencer with her tenders would have charge
of the towns on the lower Cape, Dennis, Brewster, Orleans, Eastham,
Wellfleet, Truro and Provincetown. So much they gathered from the
lieutenants conversation, but beyond this they got no inkling of the
enemys plans.

A summons from the captain brought them once more into the presence of
that doughty warrior. His manner to his captives was very agreeable,
indeed, one might say cordial. He told them many anecdotes of the
great Nelson, whom he spoke of with enthusiasm. He gave a sailors
description of the battle of Trafalgar where the admiral died a heros
death, and he held the close attention of his hearers as he pictured
the maneuvers of the opposing fleets on that memorable day.

Though much interested in the captains yarns, Hoppy and Win could
not help feeling anxious about his delay in broaching the subject of
their ransom, but, of course, they could not very well hurry him to
the point. They had an idea that Raggett was purposely avoiding the
issue, and they knew they could best serve their own cause by patiently
waiting until he thought the time was ripe for a declaration of his
views on the matter.

At length that time arrived. Captain Raggett produced a chart of Cape
Cod bay and laid it on the table.

Now, men, he said, I daresay you want to learn my terms? You
will know very soon and I have great hopes that we can come to an
agreement. In my opinion, you will get out of your predicament without
much trouble, but that will depend altogether on yourselves. However,
before we discuss the question of ransom I should like to ask you a few
questions about this chart. You may answer or not, just as you please.

The prisoners were somewhat surprised at this move. Then Captain
Knowles replied:

I dont know that there is any great harm in answering any questions
about the chart, Captain Raggett. I suppose theres nothing secret
about it. Every shipmaster can get a chart of Cape Cod bay easily
enough.

Thats so, said Raggett, and Im glad you take such a sensible view
of it. However, this chart is not clear in some particulars and I would
like to have your opinion. So far as the deepwater section of the bay
is concerned there is no difficulty in following it, but, as you very
well know, almost every year there is a variation in the depth of water
in the neighborhood of the bars and in the channels close inshore.
Therefore, a chart five years old may require correction for those
places.

Why, yes, Captain Raggett, cried Hoppy, sometimes after a November
gale whole chunks of the mainland disappear and what were cornfields
become tidewater flats! If youre relying on a chart five years old
youll have to go easy inshore.

That is my point exactly. Now, lets take the shore waters of your own
town of Eastham. The flats are dry at low water for nearly a mile to
seaward. Have there been any great changes in that locality in recent
years?

Well, Captain Raggett, replied Hoppy, there certainly have been
changes. They dig clams now in some places where they harvested salt
hay five years ago. Dont know that theres much difference on the
outer edge of the flats, but theres no knowing, and wary skippers
dont venture very far inshore. A fifty-ton lumber schooner got badly
strained there three years ago.

Then it would not be safe for a large vessel?


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Captain Raggett of the British frigate Nymph is interrogating American prisoners Hoppy and Win about the Cape Cod bay area. He is specifically interested in changes in the depth of water near the shore, as he is planning to blockade the area. Hoppy and Win warn him that the depth of water can change drastically after storms, making it dangerous for large vessels to get too close to shore.
