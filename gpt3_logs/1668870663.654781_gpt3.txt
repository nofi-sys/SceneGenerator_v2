SCENE:
IV

_When yer flat on yer back, wit a doctor as referee an a traind
nurse holdin the towel, why its up t youse, Cull, its up t
youse!_

CHIP NOLANS REMARKS.


A RED-FACED, bare-armed woman opened a door in Murphys court and threw
a pan of garbage into the gutter. Her next door neighbour was walking
up and down the narrow strip of sidewalk, hushing the cry of a weazened
baby.

Is Jamsie not well, Mrs. Burns? inquired the red-faced woman.

Sorry the bit, Mrs. Nolan; hes as cross as two sticks. Its walk up
an down the floor wid him Ive been doin all the Gods blessed night.
Scure till the wink av slape Ive had since I opened me two eyes at
half after foive yisterday mornin.

Poor sowl! Yez shud git him a rubber ring till cut his teeth on; its
an illigant ting for childer, Im towld.

Contractor McGlorys stables and cart sheds stood on the opposite side
of the court. A young man sat on a feed-box in the doorway polishing
a set of light harness; a group of dirty children were playing under
an up-tilted cart, and a brace of starving curs fought savagely up the
alley over a mouldy bone. Mrs. Nolan called to the young man:

An sure, is it out drivin yezed be goin so arly on Sunday mornin,
Jerry?

Ony a little spin, said the youth. I want to try out a new skate
what the old gent bought at the bazar. He rubbed away in industrious
silence for a moment and then, nodding toward a clean-looking brick
house at the end of the court, inquired:

Did youse see Johnnie Kerrigan go in?

Is it young Kerrigan go intill Murphys! Mrs. Nolan seemed
dumbfounded.

Not the saloon-keepers son that do be at the torneyin! cried Mrs.
Burns.

Thats the guy, said Jerry. He went in a couple o minutes ago.

Mrs. Nolan looked at her neighbour, and the latter lady returned the
look with interest.

I declare till God! said the former, Iv that dont bate all I iver
heerd since the day I wur born. Sure an his father an owld Larry have
been bitter at wan another for years.

Its forgivin his enemies hell be doin now that the breath do be
lavin him, said Mrs. Burns. Divil the fear av him forgivin me the
bit av rint I owes him, though, she added bitterly.

Theres worse than old Murphy, said Jerry. Kellys got his net out
after the court, an if he lands it, it wont be long before youse find
it out, either.

But Mrs. Burns could only think of the crusty old harpy who went from
door to door down the court on the first day of the month, the skinny
old claw that reached out so graspingly for the rent, the leathery old
face frowning blackly upon delay, of the bitter tongue that spat venom
into the faces of all not ready to pay. And for the life of her, the
good woman could think of none worse than old Larry Murphy to deal
with.

Faix an hed take the bit av bread out av the childrens mouths,
declared she.

A flock of grimy sparrows suddenly lit upon the roof of the stable,
chattering, fluttering and fighting madly; one of the quarrelling dogs
had been defeated and licked his wounds and howled dolefully; a drunken
man, passing the end of the court, pitched into the gutter and lay
there.

Mother av Heaven! exclaimed Mrs. Nolan with a suddenness that caused
her neighbour to jump. She was pointing toward the house spoken of as
Murphys. Look there!

Young Larry Murphy was standing upon the white stone step; he had just
pulled the door bell softly; and catching the astonished stare of the
two women, he swore at them under his breath.

Theyre next already, he muttered. Theyll chew me up, an spit me
out, an laugh about it! Why dont the fagots stay in the house!


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Mrs. Nolan and Mrs. Burns are gossiping in their courtyard when they see Jerry, the stable boy, preparing to go for a drive. Mrs. Nolan comments on how early it is for Jerry to be driving on a Sunday morning. Jerry says he's just going for a spin and wants to try out a new skate he bought.
The conversation turns to Johnnie Kerrigan, the son of the local tavern owner, who has just been seen entering the house of their mutual enemy, old Larry Murphy. Both women are shocked at this news.
Mrs. Nolan and Mrs. Burns discuss how terrible old Murphy is, and how he would never forgive them if they couldn't pay their rent on time. They also mention Kelly, another landlord who is trying to evict them from their homes.
Suddenly, they see young Larry Murphy standing on the steps of Murphy's house. He looks over at the women and swears at them before going inside.
The women are surprised and confused by this turn of events.
