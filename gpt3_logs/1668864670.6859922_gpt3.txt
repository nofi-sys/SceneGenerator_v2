SCENE:
Well, I hope in my heart she has got a niece, Mrs. Watkins returned.

She ought to be here, Julie persisted. She ought to come to Miss
Fogg, in case I have to leave.

Why, you thinkin of goin away?

No--Oh, no. Not really, Julie evaded hastily, with that little
breathless catch in her voice which was characteristic of her under any
stress. No. But I might.

Well, it would be a sad day for everybody in this house if you was
to leave, Mrs. Watkins said heartily. Youve got something about you
most people aint got. Youre so--so good.

Julie looked up, her eyes wide and horrified.

Oh--Oh, no! Im not. Dont say that, she faltered blindly.

It was after her talk with Mrs. Watkins that Julie made a fresh attempt
to get Miss Fogg to write to her niece. The old woman would never give
her either the nieces name or her address. That and the locked drawer
in her bureau were the only things over which she evinced the secretive
suspicion toward Julie that she showed toward every one else. When
Julie tried again that afternoon to persuade her, she firmed her lips
obstinately.

Ill write if I want, an Ill not if I dont, she announced.

Look, Julie coaxed. See, Ive brought you in ink and paper and
everything. See what nice paper this is.

Miss Fogg took the paper and inspected it critically. Thats right
nice, she admitted. I wouldnt write to her on any but the best
paper; she thinks a heap of having things stylish.

Julie drew up a table and spread the writing materials invitingly upon
it.

There now, just write her a few lines, she begged.

The old woman looked at all the preparation dimly, but presently she
really did pick up the pen, and squaring herself at the table made a
few trembling strokes. My baby child, she scrawled, the line running
slantingly down the paper. My little baby, she attempted again and
then, staring at the words, she broke down in tears. I cant do it,
she wept. I cant. I cant get beyond My baby child. I just think of
her like that. She dont seem to me like a grown person, an its all I
can think to say.

Thats plenty: thats all shell need, Julie comforted her. Ill
write her a letter and tell her all about everything, and put in what
youve written.

Well, the old woman consented shakingly, well, tell her--Oh, tell
her please to come! Tell her not to be mad at me. And then all at once
the secret of the old womans heart burst forth. Shes mad at me about
something. She wont come. Ive written and written--of course I have.
But she dont even answer. She dont send a word. Shes gone back on
me. She looked up at Julie, her old face all distorted and twitching.
Dont tell--dont you tell any of these onery folks--but shes gone
back on me. She dont ever write nor nothin. Not even Christmas time.
I aint told on her. Ive kep it all to myself, here in my breast--but
its erbout killed me. All Ive got in the world! All-- The words fell
into sobs.

But she _will_ come now! Julie promised with poignant sympathy. She
just doesnt understand. But Ill write so shell see she must come.

Well--you write, the other agreed with a pathetic confidence in
Julie. Maybe shell come for you. Tell her--Oh, tell her her old
Tannie is sick an wants her. Tannie, that was what she always called
me: it was as near as she could come to saying Aunt Annie when she
was little.

Julie did write. She did not know the nieces name, and was afraid to
ask, dreading a return of that sly suspicious look that was always
brought out on Miss Foggs face when she questioned her too closely
about anything. So she began the letter Madam, and when she came to
the signing of her own name, she hesitated. She had never yet brought
herself to write, Julie Freeman. She had always managed in some way
to avoid doing so. For all that she had said that the name was no lie,
she could not make herself write it. But her own name she dared not
put. So in the end she signed it, From a Friend.

She wrote urgently, and enclosed the sheet on which Miss Foggs
trembling words, My baby child, went slanting down the paper. Then
she sealed the envelope and stamped it.

Now then, she said with an assumption of confidence that she did not
feel, whats her address?
