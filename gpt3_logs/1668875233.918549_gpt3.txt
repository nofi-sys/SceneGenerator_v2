SCENE:
Miss Taylor told me you were coming, and my unfailing instinct told
me that, being a lady, you would have forgotten to have all the
arrangements necessary for your comfort made before your arrival. Now
you shall see whether I have forgotten how to do marketing. There is
the twopenny cottage, there is the superior souchong, and there is the
oleomargarine--the very best. And that is for you.

He gave her a little box, which she opened and found to contain ferns
and gardenias. She sat down and handled them lovingly, with the simple
pleasure of a child, and, when she looked up, she found Aubrey raking
out the coals of the extinct fire with a poker.

Never mind; leave it alone. It is out; and, if I ring and make the
girl light it again, she will only fill the room with smoke. I am not
very cold.

Indeed for the moment she had forgotten that she was cold; but she
shivered now and then.

But I am. Now you shall see what it is to have a universal genius
about you. In ten minutes my art will produce from this gloomy heap of
cinders----

A cloud of thick black smoke which will suffocate us both. Dont
be silly, Aubrey; do leave it alone! said Annie, petulantly,
condescending to struggle for the poker.

But he would not let it go; so she resigned herself to watching while
he broke up the little fragile box which had held the flowers, took the
paper off his other parcels, and set to work earnestly to make a fire.

You will look just like a sweep when you have finished, said Annie,
with resignation.

A little soap and water will remove all traces of the deed.

Oh, of course, if you like to play at maid-of-all-work! said she,
contemptuously. Her spirits were rising again to the level of the old
days when she and he were on tour with the Comedy Company.

He rose superior to her scorn, for, after a little trouble and one or
two more gusts of smoke, the fire began to burn up brightly.

Now ring for a kettle, and let us make tea ourselves, said he.

She rang, the tea-things were brought up, and in a few minutes Annie,
refreshed and comforted, was listening to his account of his movements
since they last met.

I have created two characters, invented a new soup, written a book,
cut it up myself in two papers, discovered my ideal woman two or three
times, had two bad colds and one attack of neuralgia, lost fifteen
pounds at cards, and narrowly escaped being married.

To one of the ideals?

Of course not. One never marries ones ideal. No; this was to be the
loveliest of her sex. Happily a man turned up at the last moment who
had a prior claim to her hand, and I was saved.

Happy woman!

I see you dont look at the case from my point of view, Miss Langton.

No; I take up the cause of my sex against you.

That is unkind. She treated me very cruelly, I assure you.

For which and for your consequent deliverance from the trammels of
constancy you are very grateful.

Do you think I am inconstant, Miss Langton? he asked, with sudden
gravity.

I am inclined to think so, certainly; but I look upon it as a very
fortunate provision of nature, said she, half laughing nervously.

Then you are wrong. If I am inconstant it is by philosophy, and not
by disposition. You know, when people have toothache very badly they
sometimes hold things that burn in their mouths, so that the small,
sharp new pain may make them forget for the moment the old dull one.

What a romantic simile!

So a man, when he has been badly treated by one woman whom he did care
for, tries to find consolation--and does so find it very often--in
flirtations with a dozen other women who have no power to make his
heart throb faster, but who can make the time pass pleasantly enough.

I have heard that sort of excuse from inconstant people before, and I
think it a very clever one.
