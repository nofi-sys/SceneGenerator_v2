Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
He started upon a well-memorized line of sales talk, which, to Fay, was
enlightening but hardly to the point he was after.

A moment, Fay said. It has just come to me, sir, that I heard a chap
in the West End say something about the dye industry. Is it so fearfully
important? Has Germany the monopoly? I rather thought they were making
the stuff in England and the States.

Cost too much! declared the commercial traveler. You see, an old dog
still has his tricks. Theres danger that the old dog, and I mean
Germany, will come into her own again in the dye industry. She had the
monopoly once, and she is liable to get it again.

Fay studied the cold end of his cigar. He waited for the man to warm to
the subject.

The commercial traveler drew his cravenette coat-collar up to his eyes
and pointed astern and over the rocking taffrail of the Channel boat.

The Island, there, he said in the voice of pounds, shillings and
pence, is recovering from one struggle and plunging into another. The
cheap labor of Germany and Russia must have an outlet. This outlet, in
dye-stuffs particularly, is threatening to flood the market. You say
that the tariff protects England and the States. I say that the tariff
does not! There are the foreign markets, open to Germany, without which
no industry can flourish. What of South America and Africa and the
velvet of the trade? Open to the Germans as well as to us!

Fay watched the mans face as he asked quickly:

This dye monopoly! Is it because of secret formulae which England has
not been able to work out?

The nail on the head! The Germans have had five thousand chemists
working on coal tar products for twenty years. They redoubled their
efforts over the years of the war. They are ready to flood the dye
markets and put out of business every dye maker in the world, save
German. You see what that means.

Fay turned and stared aft. So the poor crawlers on that Island are face
to face with the problem of finding the secrets of the dye industry? he
inquired.

Oh, if they had all the formulae they could bankrupt the German game! I
heard that secrets were brought through Switzerland. I never learned of
anything coming of them. Sort of stalemated there! I suppose the Foreign
Office was hoaxed.

Most likely, said Fay, fearing to go further in the matter. I did
hear something to that effect. Too bad!

The traveler clutched the rail and waited for the boat to finish
twisting on a downward lunge which followed the general outlines of a
corkscrew. Fay glided off and forward. He stood in a shadow beneath the
damp ladder that led upward to the wheel-house and chart-room. He
grasped a stay and peered beyond the green glow which was thrown outward
from a faint starboard light.

The wall of yellowish fog toward which they were ever steaming rested
upon long oily rollers which were crossed by smaller waves. The North
Sea gave forth a hollow sound as from some vast space. The hiss of their
swift passage was like yeast in process of fermenting.

Clutched in the onward surge of the passage, he reviewed the words of
the commercial traveler. There was food for thought in them. The great
game to play concerned the destiny of a vast industry. Briefly, Germany
was about ready to ruin the dye enterprises of the States and England.
The matter hung on the thin thread of the cipher which Sir Richard had
shown to him in that dingy house near the Embankment.

That, solved, would place the entire world on an equality. The little
dye works could compete with the larger. The formulae would be open to
any man. The galling monopoly, to come, would be removed. It all lay in
that safe in Holland toward which the fast boat was steaming.

Fay stared at the yellow curtain and dug deep within his brain. It was
possible to double back on his trail, soon after landing, and make for
Scotland. From there he could take steamer to the States. It was also
possible to work by little-known lines through Stavanger and the
northern cities. The Yard had no call upon him save a personal appeal.

Freedom of action had broadened his thoughts. He no longer was the
numbered thing in the stony coffin at Dartmoor. He breathed, and lived
and had some right to the good things of this life.

Unclasping his hand from the stay, he turned and glanced along the deck.
It was lined with passengers who huddled against the railshapeless
masses of brown and gray and glistening waterproof.

The commercial traveler had met with a kindred soul in the person of the
little Scot with a bundle. Their voices sounded above the roar of the
swift passage. The Scot was, in his cunning way, pumping the traveler
dry as to what he had said to Fay.
