What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Not much to tell, the younger brother replied, and gave a skeleton
outline of the story.

They started on their journey next morning, made a short day of it on
account of Hughs wound, and put up at Carson for the night.

On what had been known as Eagle Ranch, in the valley of the same name,
the town of Carson had been built. During the previous decade both Eagle
and Carson valleys had served as a refuge for those who ran off stolen
stock from San Francisco and other California points. In these hidden
parks the outlaws had been accustomed to rest and feed the herds before
making the desert trip by obscure routes to Salt Lake. But those days
were past. Carson now had two thousand inhabitants, a boom in town lots,
and a civic consciousness. It had become respectable, though guns still
flashed frequently. Already it was laying political wires to become the
capital of Nevada, the battle-born state.

Through Carson supplies came by way of Mormon Station for the diggings
at Virginia, along a road which wound around the base of the hills. As
Scot drove in, the air was musical with chimes. Some of these came soft
and mellow from a great distance. Each mule of the freight outfits had a
circlet of bells suspended in a steel bow above its collar. They made
music as they moved.

At the hay corral into which McClintock drove, scores of outfits were
gathered, most of them freighters to or from the diggings. A dozen
others could be heard jingling in, from one direction or the other. The
winter had been a severe one, and hundreds of cattle in the adjacent
valleys had died for lack of feed. Hay was scarce. There was a very
strong demand for it to feed the freight outfits. Just now the price was
three hundred dollars a ton. Ranchers found it far more profitable to
let their cattle rustle on bunch grass and take a chance of roughing
through than to feed hay worth such a price. Wherefore all the native
hay went to the stock hauling supplies.

Scot hailed Baldy Green, a well-known stage driver. How about places up
on the stage for me and Hugh to-morrow, old-timer?

Baldy rubbed the top of his shiny head and grinned at him. Full up.
Like to ditch a couple of my passengers for you if I coulda jewellery
peddler and a sky pilotbut I dont reckon I can, Scot.

The eyes of the older McClintock sparkled. Show em to me, Baldy.

Three minutes later the Beau Brummel of Virginia City might have been
seen in earnest conversation with a clergyman who hailed from Buffalo,
New York. He was telling the story of the Indian attack upon his brother
and making certain deductions from it. His manner of grave deference was
perfect.

But bless my soul, do you really think the redskins are likely to
attack the stage to-morrow? asked the startled missionary.

Cant tell, sir. They were certainly heading this way when last seen.
Big chance of it, Id say. Im a sinnera professional gambler. What
does it matter about me? But youthe only minister of the Gospel in a
hundred milesyou cant be spared. The harvest is ripe for the reaper.
Why not wait here a day or two and make sure the Piutes are not around?

The missionary was frankly frightened, but he had in him the stuff of
heroes. His lower lip became a thin straight line of resolution. No
professional gambler should put his courage to shame. If he rode through
the valley of the shadow he had a promise from Holy Writ to comfort him.

Ill go if the stage goes, he said stoutly.

Scot McClintock knew when he was beaten temporarily. But he was not the
man to give up a point upon which he had set his heart. He looked up a
friend of his, the mayor of the town, drew him aside, and whispered
persuasively in his ear.

The fat little man with whom he talked exploded a protest. But doggone
it, Scot, if the Gospel shark accepts, wont I have to go to his
meetin?

Maybe so. What of it? Be a good scout, Adams. I want that boy of mine
to get up to Virginia to-morrow so that I can make him comfortable.

The mayor grinned. Never saw your beat for gettin your own way. All
right. Ill rustle up some of the women and ask him.

Scot dropped into the What Cheer House and glanced around. The jewellery
salesman was sitting in a corner by himself. McClintock introduced
himself and invited the stranger to a rum cocktail or a whisky sling. In
five minutes he knew all about the peddlers business and how much he
hoped to make from the sale of his stock at Virginia.

But why not sell it here in Carson? The towns booming. Lots of money
here. More women. Up in Virginia they cant think anything except
mines, Scot suggested.
