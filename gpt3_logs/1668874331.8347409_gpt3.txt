SCENE:
Not what you told several other people. How about it, Dunc? You want to
be an accessory to this crime?

No, sir, an I aint aimin to be either. If I knew anything Id tell
you, but I cant tell you what I dont know, can I?

The young man was no match for the sheriff. Before Matson had left the
place he knew all that King did.

Forty-eight hours later the sheriff with a posse rode up to the Circle
Diamond Ranch. Rowan McCoy was sitting on the porch oiling a gun. The
first glance told him that Matson had two prisoners, the second that
they were Falkner and Silcott.

Matson swung from the saddle and came up the steps to the porch.

Ive got bad news for you, Mac, he said bluntly. Youre under
arrest.

The cattleman did not bat an eye. What for? he asked evenly.

For killing Gilroy and Tait.

The damn fools going around arrestin everybody he knows, Mac, broke
in Falkner.

McCoy observed that Falkner was hand-cuffed and that Silcott was not.

He asked the sheriff a question. Do I understand that youve arrested
Hal an Larry for this, too?

Yes, Mac. Larry behaved sensible an promised not to make any trouble,
so I aim to be as easy on him as I can. Falkner had other notions. He
tried to make a gun play.

You takin us to Wagon Wheel, Aleck?

Yes.

You have a warrant for my arrest?

The officer showed the warrant and Rowan glanced over it.

All right, said McCoy. Ill saddle up an be ready in a jiffy.

No need for that, Mac. Fact is, Im not quite ready to start. Got a
little more business to do first. If you dont mind Ill make the Circle
Diamond my headquarters for a few hours, Matson proposed amiably.

The owner of the ranch answered pleasantly but perhaps with a touch of
sarcasm. Anything you say, Aleck. If yore boys are here at dinner time
I expect Mrs. Stovall can fix you-all up.

Sure, Mac, an if he needs horses or guns probably you can lend him a
few, Falkner added with an oath. An maybe a puncher or two to join
his damned posse.

No use gettin annoyed, Hal, the ranch owner said quietly. This looks
like a silly business to us, but Aleck has to make his play. Hes not
arrestin us for pleasure. I reckon he thinks hes got some evidence, or
maybe he wants to scare us into thinkin he has some so he can pick up
something against someone else.

Youll find Ive got evidence aplenty, Mac, the sheriff answered
mildly. No hard feelings, you understand. All in the way of business.
Have I got yore word if I dont put the cuffs on you that youll go with
me to Wagon Wheel quietly?

Yes. Were not desperadoes, Aleck. We are just plain hill ranchmen. If
youd just mentioned it wed have come in without any posse to guard
us.

Hmp! The sheriff made no other comment. He glanced at Falkner by way
of comment on McCoys criticism. Im leavin three of the boys here,
Mac. Be back here myself in a few hours, I reckon. If I dont get back
Ive arranged for you to make a start for town about two oclock. That
agreeable to you?

Any time that suits you, McCoy answered.

The sheriff was back within the specified time limit. He brought with
him Rogers and Yerby. From a remark he dropped later McCoy learned that
Cole had been arrested earlier in the day at Wagon Wheel.

You are makin quite a gather, Aleck, said Rogers. There are several
other ranchmen up here youve overlooked. How about them?

Ive got all I want for the present, Brad, the sheriff replied.

His manner was not reassuring, nor was the fact that he had picked out
and arrested just the six men who had been engaged in the night raid.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the sheriff's authority and to show that he has evidence against the men he has arrested. The author also uses this scene to create suspense and tension by hinting that the sheriff may have more arrests to make.
