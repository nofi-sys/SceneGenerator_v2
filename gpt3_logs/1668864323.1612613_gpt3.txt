Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
It was fading in my mind, even as I tried to tell about it.
Frantically, I sought to grasp those vague, vanishing memories.

"Something about a place called Aarl! And I thought my name was T'Shal,
and--and I can't remember, now."

"Ellis, try to remember!" Dixon urged. "Think hard, man!"

The harder I tried, the more swiftly receded those fast-fading
memories. It was all gone already from my brain.

We talked it over for hours that night, after I had recovered from my
shakiness.

"We've stumbled onto experimental proof of the most revolutionary
theory in scientific history," Dixon said. "Proof that the mind is a
wholly different species and entity from the human body, and is merely
a symbiotic partner of that body.

"Good Heavens, think of all the things that it would explain! If you
could only remember more, Ellis! Think again--what was it about Aarl?"

Aarl? The name vibrated in my thoughts like something faint, far away,
heartbreaking.

Did you ever try to remember something and couldn't, yet the very thing
you couldn't remember made you feel sad? It was that way with me.

I knew that Aarl meant something to me, something wonderful and
terrifying. But I couldn't remember what it was.

"There's a possible explanation of your quick forgetfulness," said
Dixon finally. "The mind-entity, once it is inhabiting the human brain,
is so far overcome by the human animal's rudimentary nervous currents
that it is drugged, inhibited.

"That would explain why young children, whose human brains are not yet
fully developed, continually have strange, fanciful 'memories' of other
things, of queer places that they call fairylands."

Burke nodded thoughtfully.

"You mean that in infancy the mind-partner of the symbiosis is not so
inhibited and can still remember its own past? Maybe Wordsworth was
right:

"'Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting,
The soul that rises with us, our life's star,
Hath had elsewhere its setting,
And cometh from afar.'"

"Something like that," Dixon affirmed, pondering. "And when the mind
gets almost free of the body-partner, as Ellis did, then it _can_
remember."

I told him, "If you had used a little stronger electroshock, if I'd
been free altogether, I know I could remember more."

Burke looked doubtful.

"What good would it do you, since you'd forget it all again when you
came back into your body?"

Dixon quickly figured an answer.

"If the free mind is a group of photons as we believe, it could
interrupt a sufficiently sensitive photoelectric beam and actuate a
relay to a telegraph-sounder. Ellis could signal us that way by the
Morse code. He could tell us right at the moment what he remembers,
_before_ he returns to his body and forgets."

"If you'll fix up such a device, I'll try the thing again!" I promised.

It was crazy of me to make that offer, I felt. The dim unearthliness
of my experience should have been enough for me.

But I was haunted by that most maddening of feelings, by a vain desire
to remember something forgotten.

Somehow, I felt that Aarl, where I had been T'Shal, was so vastly
important as to overrule any danger to my life as Fred Ellis. I had a
premonition of beauty and wonder and horror all waiting to burst upon
me--if I could only remember them!

So the next night, when I again took my place on the table, it was with
increased eagerness. Dixon had showed me the beam of photoelectric
force now crossing the room just above the table.

"You said that as a mind you were aware of locations and could move,
Ellis. Well, if you can move into this beam, it will actuate the
telegraph-sounder and signal us.


BRIEF OUTLINE:

==========

- Dixon and Ellis are discussing Ellis' recent experience of leaving his body and forgetting everything
- They decide to try again, with a more sensitive device to record Ellis' memories
- Ellis enters the beam of light and begins to remember his past life on another planet
- He signals to Dixon, who records his memories
- Ellis forgets everything again when he returns to his body
