SCENE:
XLII

A QUESTION OF IMPORTANCE


THAT which is frequently termed coincidence is, as everyone knows,
seldom an isolated event; it is the fact that two or more events,
neither of them, perhaps, of any precise and definite importance, occur
simultaneously, each event having some particular bearing on the other.
If the events should chance to be more than two, the coincidence is
termed extraordinary; and if they should chance to be several, and,
also, individually of some importance--well, then I pity the man who
narrates them to an unsympathetic audience. If he isnt branded a
liar out and out, he will, at least, be thought to be possessed of an
imagination which is first cousin to one. If he isnt despised, he will
be pitied,--pitied, too, with a patronizing commiseration which will
make his blood boil. Asseveration of the truth of his statement will
be worse than useless. It will merely call forth a smile, a kindly
condescending smile, which says plainer than spoken words:

Oh, yes, we know you _believe_ it to be true. But these things _dont_
happen.

And if, in the face of that exasperating smile he should venture on
protest, he will at once receive the gently amazed reply:

My dear fellow, I never said I doubted your word.

A reply which will leave him helpless, though fuming.

Of course it is foolish to care. Truth is truth, and theres the end
ont. But he does care. He knows his statement has been marvellous,
incredulous; he knows, too, that he has probably been a fool to mention
it. But having done so, he wants belief. The man who will remark with
inner conviction, Truth is stranger than fiction, would be a godsend
to him at the moment. But the man who will say that of anothers
narrative is a _rara avis_. He reserves it as the Amen to his own.

Yet, in spite of knowing all this, it is my lot to narrate certain
extraordinary coincidences in the forthcoming pages. Therefore I can
only trust that my audience will be a trifle less incredulous than the
majority of audiences. Perhaps if it werent for one of the events,
which certainly smacks of the miraculous, I might have more hope.

However, to proceed.

You have been given one event in the preceding chapter.

The second concerns Antony.

It was the nursemaid who did the mischief, since, in one sense, it must
certainly be termed mischief. It all arose from an ill-advised remark.
Possibly exasperation caused it. Well give her the benefit of the
doubt. It is true that Biddy being, at the moment, a victim to severe
toothache, extra work had been laid on Louisas shoulders. Had Biddy
been present, you may be very sure that the remark had not been made.

Antony had taken the loss of his title calmly. This was hardly
surprising. After all, it made extraordinarily little difference. It
was seldom that he heard it, and then only from the lips of comparative
strangers. The little master, was infinitely more familiar to him,
and there was still no earthly reason for changing that mode of
address. The prospect of a new home was also taken philosophically;
there was, indeed, a certain amount of excitement about it.

But one Friday morning--to be accurate, it was the very morning of the
somewhat momentous conversation recently referred to--further enquiry
entered his mind.

If I arent Sir Antony, what are I? he demanded of a busy nursemaid.

Nobody particular, replied Louisa, who, hunting for some mislaid
article, had no mind to give to problems.

Antony demurred.

I must be somebody, he argued.

Everybody is somebody, retorted Louisa, but it dont mean theyre
anybody of importance.

Antony pricked up his ears.

Whats importance? he demanded.

Bless the child! cried Louisa, why, you was important when you was
Sir Antony. Now youre of no more account than a beggar boy.

Antony flushed. Resentment rose hot within his soul.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is conversational and matter-of-fact. There is a hint of sarcasm in Louisa's tone, but overall the tone is neutral. The point of view is third person omniscient.
