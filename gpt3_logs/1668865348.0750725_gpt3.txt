SCENE:
When he first woke in the morning, he thought he was all right again.
His long sleep had removed his lassitude, and his mind was in a dreamy
condition from the effects of the morphia, so that he was not in a fit
state to worry himself by idle fears or expectations.

Come! come! he thought as he was dressing, this is better! I was
sure my nerves were unnaturally upset last night. If the feeling
returns, all I need do is to have recourse to my little friend here.
The worry I have gone through is enough to make any man ill. To make
him exaggerate matters into the bargain, and see everything in its
worst light. It was an accident, which might have happened to scores
of people who have not troubled themselves about the matter. I am not
even sure, at this date, if I really caused the disaster! I put out my
hand, I know, but I could not swear that I touched her. She stepped
backwards, most likely of her own accord, and so fell over, without
any aid from me! I believe it was so; it is best I should believe it,
for all our sakes. I shall mourn her loss none the less, dear, darling
girl, because I persuade myself that it was Heavens will and not my
hasty temper that caused it.

His wife was surprised to see the placid humour in which he descended
to the breakfast-table. He did not eat much, it is true, but all his
appearance of despair had vanished, until she began to think she must
have been mistaken, and that his mood of the night before had been due
to the cause to which he had ascribed it--over-fatigue and worry. Mr
Crampton being about to start for the Highlands that evening, there was
a good deal to arrange before they parted, so Henry Hindes went off
in good time to the city, and for the rest of the morning was immersed
in business. The appearance of the poor father in his deep sables, and
with his lowered tones and depressed air, did prick his conscience a
little, but the influence of the morphia was still upon him, and a
few glasses of wine soon dispersed the feeling. The first thing which
renewed the discomfort of the night before, was the fact of Mr Crampton
leaving the office, to seek that of his solicitor, Mr Throgmorton.
Henry Hindes knew what he was going for, and tried to prevent him.

My dear friend, he said, in an expostulating voice, I hope you
are not thinking of putting the idea you mooted to me yesterday into
execution. You must not, indeed. You will give me great pain if you do,
for I neither deserve it, nor desire it.

But the old man would not listen to him.

My dear Hindes, I shall tell you nothing about my intentions. They
are locked in my own breast. I do not know but that I shall not take
your advice after all. My wife, as you reminded me, has many needy
relatives who will be thankful to be remembered in my will. But you
acknowledge the necessity for an alteration. You will come and see us
off from Euston, at eight oclock this evening, wont you? I know that
my wife and Miss Bostock would be grieved to leave without shaking
hands with you.

I will be there, without fail, replied Hindes, as he walked to the
office door with his partner.

What a terrible change in Mr Crampton, sir, remarked the clerk, who
was waiting to speak to him on his return.

Do you think so, Mr Davidson? said Hindes, mechanically.

Think so, sir? Why! its the talk of the whole office. Theres death
marked in the poor gentlemans face. He wont be with us long, sir, I
feel sure of that.

I trust you are mistaken, Davidson. Mr Cramptons going away for
change to Scotland to-night, and will not return to business until his
health is quite restored.

I hope it may be, sir; I hope, Im sure, with all my heart, that it
may be, for Mr Cramptons been very good to all of us; but if you ask
me my opinion, I dont believe hell ever come back at all.

Well, I didnt ask your opinion, Davidson, replied Mr Hindes,
fretfully; and as Mr Crampton has the very best of advice, I think we
may safely leave him in the hands of his doctor.

Oh! yes, sir, of course; and I hope I havent said too much. But he
does look very bad indeed--not like the same gentleman, repeated the
clerk, as he went back to his work.

This little conversation disconcerted Henry Hindes, and his uneasy
condition was augmented by the entrance of an old friend, a Colonel
Brinsley, whom he had known for years.

My dear Hindes, exclaimed the colonel, as he threw himself in an
arm-chair, you might knock me down with a feather. I was on my way
here, when I met poor Mr Crampton. Never saw such a change in any man
in my life. Why, hes the shadow of his former self. Of course Ive
heard about the sad loss he has sustained, but, hang it all! Hindes,
although it is a terrible thing to lose a child, it doesnt as a rule
shrivel a man up to half his usual size. He is a mere skeleton. His
clothes hang upon him in bags. I never was more shocked in my life.
