SCENE:
But as the cat paused in the doorway, looking uncertainly from one to
the other, half crouched, with green eyes glinting and tail lashing,
Mrs. Anderson dragged it forward by the scruff of the neck, and in an
instant the combination was effected. There was a pounce, a last shriek
of supreme agony from the fledgling, and with a growl the cat ran out
of the room, the bird in its mouth.

Julie leaned against the counter, swallowing convulsively.

Julie! for mercy sake! you know that was the onliest thing to do. When
they come down the chimney like that, you just have to give em to the
cat. There aint another thing _to_ do.

I--I might have tried to raise it, Julie said, weakly.

No, you could not, Mrs. Anderson retorted. You dont know what to
feed it; an even sposing you did, you aint got time to waste pokin
fishin worms down a nasty little naked birds throat--specially now in
the war when our boys needs every single thing we can do for em.

I know, but--

Well, but what?

It sounded so awful when the cat got it!

Julie! I never did see any person take things as hard as you do. I
reckon its because youre so thin. Just look at your arms! Mrs.
Anderson took one of Julies hands, and pushed the loose sleeve up
above her elbow. Looks about the size of a toothpick to me. If you
were fleshier, things wouldnt get to you so quick. Look at me, now,
she commanded, drawing up her frank proportions. Things have to
go through about six inches of grease fore they can reach me. But
you--why youre pretty near as naked to the world as that nasty little
chimney-swallow. You cant go through life like that. Oh, its all
right for a real young girl, but you must be over thirty; its time you
was featherin up, dearie.

Julie snapped off the light in silence, and they passed out of the shop.

Well, I will say one thing for you, you always look s nice, Mrs.
Anderson approved her, as they emerged from Julies side door and set
out together along the village street. I never seen you when you
didnt look like youd stepped right out of a bandbox. Thats a mighty
cute little collar you got on, dearie, she continued, fingering the
delicate ruffles at Julies neck. Julie was constantly at the mercy of
other womens hands. Her smallness stirred their maternal instincts;
they were apt to stroke her and patronize her. I declare, you dont
seem like nothing but a doll baby to me, her companion pursued, her
large damp hand giving Julies shoulder a final pat. It beats me
why you never married, Julie.--Oh my Lord! she broke off abruptly,
clapping her hand to her mouth.

What is it? Whats the matter? Julie cried, in alarm.

Mrs. Anderson performed some violent mouth-gymnastics behind her palm.
Its my teeth, she explained, spasmodically, at last. I cant seem
to get used to this new set, an seems like theyre always a-bitin at
my tongue. I have to watch em all the time. An Im mightily afraid
theyll drop out in company some day. She withdrew her hand at
length, and they started on again. But as I say, she continued, I
dont see why in the name of goodness you never married.

I never wanted to marry, Julie said hastily, an uncomfortable
restraint falling upon her.

Oh yes, thats just what every old maid says, if youll excuse _me_,
Mrs. Anderson retorted.

No--but its true; I mean it, Julie protested. I--I always just
hated the idea of getting married. It scares me to think of it.

They were passing under an electric light, and Mrs. Anderson looked
down at her curiously. Well, now, aint that funny? I just believe
thats so, she stated. An it aint for want of chances, neither.
There was Sam Dodson--he courted you, didnt he?

Julie was silent, but in the street light Mrs. Anderson could see the
nervous self-consciousness of her face.

Oh, all right, dont tell, then, she continued. But everybody knows
he did, an Pinckney Wayland, too--and wasnt there a drummer feller
from Cincinnati? Why, Julie, youve had a heap of chances. Most people
would brag about em. Scary as you are, Id think youd want to be
married an have a man round to look after you--There! there, now!
She stopped again, dramatically.

What is it? Your teeth? Julie inquired, with concern.

No, but I got an idea. Its come to me all of a sudden. I just believe
Ill make a match between you and the new preacher. Now I think thatd
be real suitable. Hes about the right age for you, an maybe marrying
a widower like that wouldnt scare you s much.
