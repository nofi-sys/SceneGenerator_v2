SCENE:
VII


JEAN did see Liane in the last act of _La Fin de lAmour_, and Liane
saw him.

Up to that moment she had no very definite intentions about Jean.
She thought if she wasnt too busy she would really give him an
evening to meet a few artists. She was good-natured and liked to do
inexpensive good turns, and if there was really anything remarkable in
Jeans powers it would decidedly prove something of a _rclame_ for
Liane herself. But it had never occurred to her to regard him more
personally. Now as she looked over the footlights and saw in one of
the front stalls the fierce ardour of his eyes, another idea occurred
to her. She was extremely sentimental and not a little superstitious.
My first musician brought me luck, she said to herself, why not try
the second? It is of course an extravagance. He has no money and no
importance, but one never knows what may come of a good action.

From this reflection it will be seen that Lianes moral code was a
trifle perverted. Still she had a moral code, as most of us have, and
Lianes took the form of occasionally doing things that did not pay
her. It almost seemed to Jean that Lianes smile was specially for him;
perhaps it was. The next evening he came in time for the first act of
_La Fin de lAmour_ though he could not again afford the stalls. It was
all very wonderful to Jean, but it soon became merged and forgotten in
the central wonder of Liane.

To Liane acting was a business, but it was a business brought to such
perfection that it became an art. It is not enough in Paris for an
actress to be beautiful, she must also act, and Liane on the stage was
a very tremendous power indeed.

It seemed inconceivable to Jean that he should ever have had the
privilege of words with her in private; his love became an effortless,
impassioned dream. It was no use his thinking about her, so of course
he thought of nothing else. Then one night he actually received a
message from behind the scenes:

Wont you come and see me? Liane de Brances.

He followed her messenger, though he still believed there was some
mistake. Liane could not have seen him, and if she had, why should
she remember him? It was five days since he had called upon her,
but it had seemed like five years to Jean. The Odon is a very big
theatre--old-fashioned and given up to long passages and bare rooms;
it lacks the exquisite arrangements of the first artists boudoir, the
colour schemes and artistic furniture of the more modern theatres,
but to Jean it all seemed magnificent enough, and Lianes room of
white and gold, stiflingly hot and brilliantly lighted, with a small
dressing-room leading out of it, astounded him by its importance.
Nothing could be too important for her, but he had never known that
artists dressing-rooms would be the least like this. Liane was giving
the little finishing touches to her third-act costume. The dresser
was still in her room, passing her all the things she might want, and
receiving a running fire of dispassionate abuse for her pains.

What animals these women are! said Liane, giving Jean her left hand,
while she touched up the thick bisque of her arched eyebrows. They
are born clumsy, awkward, infuriating--now you may go, she added to
the impassive dresser, and dont forget to come in time for the next
act; if I have to ring twice for you again, you shall be sent to paint
the clowns cheek in the next pantomime! Well, Monsieur Jean, do you
realize that to-morrow is Sunday and that I wish you to meet all those
grand music-makers I told you about at ten oclock, _chez moi_; and how
do you find _La Fin de lAmour_? I perceive you have been here often
enough; am I to congratulate its author on having at last found his
public? The same piece five nights running--that I call faithfulness!
And it is evident that no woman has influenced you, for you have never
been seen in the green room!

I have not come to see the play, said Jean quite simply. I have come
to see you. He looked a little frightened at his boldness, but Liane
only laughed, and ran a powder-puff lightly over her cheek and lips.
And I shall go on coming to see you, he added firmly.

But of course; it would be dreadful if you stopped! said Liane, that
would be the end of the compliment; but does the front of the house
satisfy you?

Jean trembled. He could hardly believe his ears, but his eyes were more
faithful witnesses, and he saw that Liane was still smiling.

Not now, he interposed, not now, Liane.

An electric bell rang out with a terrible persistent sound, close to
Jeans ear. Liane caught up a soft gauze wrap that lay on a chair.

I must be off, she said placidly. _A demain, mon petit_; run away
now, this passage to your right. But yes, you may kiss my hand if you
like. _Au revoir!_ And Liane sailed swiftly off, leaving Jean to find
his way back to his seat in the house, dizzy and stunned with emotion.
