SCENE:
But you say they played Star in center. And youre after right, arent
you?

Im after anything I can get, son. A fellow who can play center can
play right or left, cant he? An outfielders just an outfielder, you
see, and you cant play more than three of em at a timeand get away
with it. Just now there are about six of us, all trying for three jobs.
I wish Star Meyer would go soak his head and not butt in on baseball!

Dud laughed. You might suggest it to him, Jimmy. Who pitched besides
Myatt? Did Brunswick get in?

Nobody. Ben went the distance. They couldnt touch him much after that
rotten third. Got a couple of hits in the fifth and about one each
inning after that. They made their last run in the eighth with two
down. A fellow cracked a two-bagger down the left foul-line and tried
to steal third, and did it because Winslow let the ball drop. Then the
next fellow hit an easy one to Ayer and Myatt didnt cover base in time
and the chap on third scrambled in. I guess it was just as well Pete
didnt derrick Ben, after all, because he certainly pitched a corking
game after that third inning. Gee, but Im hungry! Wish I was at
training table, he added wistfully. They get steaks there!

They went over to Nick Blakes room after supper and found Hugh and
Bert and Guy Murtha there, and there was much baseball talked and
many might-have-beens discussed. Dud, as a non-participant, had
little to say, and Hugh, who might have talked a good deal since he
had rather distinguished himself by his work at the bat and on the
bases, was almost as silent. After awhile, on the excuse of showing
Dud a new book, Hugh led the other off upstairs and they settled down
full-length on the window-seat, beside the open casements, and had a
fine, chummy talk. Dud could talk well enough when there was but a
single listener, and tonight Hugh found the younger boy far from dull.
By the time Bert Winslow came in, yawning, they had discovered numerous
bonds of sympathy such as mutual likes and dislikes and an intense
desire to make good at baseball. Hugh, entering the game as the veriest
tyro and with a deal of doubt and not much enthusiasm, was now a rabid
fan and almost amusingly eager to make a name for himself.

Bert, I think, wanted to go to bed, but was too polite to start while
there was a visitor present, and so toppled into a chair and joined the
conversation. Dud realized that Bert didnt care very much for him and
so tried to get away a few minutes after the others advent, but Hugh
wouldnt have it.

Oh, sit down and behave yourself, Baker! It isnt late. I say, Bert,
Baker and I have been discovering that we have lots of things in
common, if you know what I mean.

Really? Bert stifled a yawn. Such as what, Ighness?

Oh, baseball, for one, you know. Tennis, too. And oysters

Oysters!

Yes. You see I happened to think that a dozen nice cold raw oysters
would taste corking. They would, wouldnt they?

Out of season, you chump.

Never! Thats only prejudice, old chap. Well, anyway, oysters was one
thing_were_ one thing, I should say. English is beastly confusing at
times, eh? And then we found that Baker knew my part of the country,
down Maryland way, you know. He comes from Delaware.

So would I, laughed Bert.

Delaware, replied Dud, smiling, is small but select. Wheres your
home, Winslow?

Pennsylvania; Shrevesport. Know it?

Dud shook his head. Some of my folks lived in Pennsylvania once, a
good many years ago.

Its a good state. They were foolish to leave it, yawned Bert. Hope
they didnt have to?

Why, in a way I believe they did. You see one of them was an officer
in the American Army, and when Howe occupied Philadelphia they thought
it might not be healthy.

Oh, said Bert. Hugh smiled.

Still, continued Bert, they neednt have gone to Delaware, eh?

I dont think they did just then. A couple of them were with
Washington at Valley Forge. I think the women went to New Jersey until
Philadelphia was evacuated again. I dont know just what happened
then. Weve been living in Delaware only since my grandfathers time.
He moved there from Philadelphia to improve his state.
