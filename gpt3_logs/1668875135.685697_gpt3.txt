SCENE:
XVII.


Annie turned with a piteous expression of face to George when her angry
husband had left them.

What can one do with a man like that? she said. It is impossible to
reason with him, impossible to understand him. He is like an overgrown
child.

I dont know about that, answered George, quietly. I think I can
understand this last outbreak pretty well.

What do you mean?

Why, when you left him, you were a little timid lily, whose charm was
quite lost upon a great senseless brute like that, said George, with
sentiment; now you have come back a----

A great flaunting dahlia, whose charm must be apparent to the meanest
observation, and particularly to a person of my husbands tastes!
finished Annie, looking up at him very gravely.

His sentiment was dispelled; he was obliged to burst out laughing.

You are too sharp for me. You know very well I did not mean that.
You are a charming woman who can hold your own in any society; you
have caused quite a flutter among us poor rustics; and Harry, finding
himself the possessor of something everybody else admires, with
dog-in-the-manger instincts, wishes to keep all to himself the treasure
whose value he himself would never have discovered and is quite unable
to appreciate.

You are too severe upon poor Harry. He has a lot of good
qualities--you know I always said so; only--unfortunately they are
qualities which dont harmonize very well with mine.

Nor with anybody elses. It is unfortunate, certainly. He would be
charming on a desert island.

I really think he would be happier there, said Annie, with a sigh,
if he had a horse and some dogs. He is kind to animals, and they seem
to understand him. Good-night, George; I must go to him now. And the
chances are even whether he will try to hit me if I go near him, or
insist on my remaining in the room till he goes to sleep.

She shook hands, and left the baronet gazing admiringly at her little
figure, as she disappeared swiftly and silently down the corridor
toward the room her husband occupied. She tapped at the door; but,
getting no answer and hearing no sound, she opened it and went in.
Harry was lying on the bed in his dressing-gown, and her first thought
was that he was not sober. But when she opened the door to Mrs. Stanley
a minute after, and saw that that dignified lady held a spirit-decanter
in her hand, she whispered:

Take that away, please. He has gone to sleep, I think.

That is all right. I was as long as I could be, and I brought it
myself, in hopes that you would be here when I came back.

The housekeeper went away, and Annie, fearful he might take cold, drew
a rug softly over her sleeping husband. The touch roused him; he turned
over toward her, and, just half opening his eyes, threw his right arm
round her neck as she was bending down, and instantly dozed off again,
tired out. The action moved Annie, and she knelt down beside the bed,
careful not to disturb him by displacing the arm that held her in an
unconscious caress until his next movement, when she woke him up, told
him to go to bed, and left him before he had time to remember his anger
against her and spoil the effect of that half-unconscious embrace.

But the next morning he was in a gentle mood, and did not allude to her
distasteful career when she brought him his breakfast. This good-humor
lasted until he went down-stairs, and, after looking in the various
rooms, found his wife in the library with William, having tracked them
by their voices and laughter.

William, with great tact, instantly assumed an appearance of
preternatural solemnity on his brothers entrance.

What is all this mystery? What are you doing in here? asked Harry,
crossly.

I am helping William with his studies, said Annie.

Upon this her promising pupil grew blue with suppressed laughter, and
Harrys manner got more and more unpleasant.

Oh, I should have thought you had had enough of schoolroom work!
However, since you havent, and Im not too proud to take a lesson,
you shall give me one, too, and he flung himself into a chair with an
uncompromising surliness which was not encouraging to a teacher.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to show the contrast between Annie's two husbands - her first husband, George, who is kind and understanding, and her second husband, Harry, who is childish and difficult to deal with.
