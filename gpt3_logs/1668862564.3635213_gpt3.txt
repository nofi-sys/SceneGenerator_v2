SCENE:
VIII


SCOT OFFERS HEALTH HINTS

A Washoe zephyr was playing impish tricks in Virginia City. It screamed
down the side of Mt. Davidson in a gale of laughter, filling the air
with the white powder of alkali dust. It snatched hats from unwary heads
and sent them flying into the cleft caon below which led through the
hills to the sage desert. It swooped up a dog on A Street and dropped
the yelping cur down the chimney of a shack on B Street. Boards were
ripped from fences and sucked straight into the air for fifty feet. A
basket of duck eggs took premature flight from a farmers wagon, sailed
through the window of a barber shop, and gave a customer in the chair a
free egg shampoo. The wind came in ribald gusts, tremendous, filled with
jeering howls.

About Virginia City there have been many disputes, but nobody who lived
there in the sixties ever denied that it was the windiest spot on
earth. The town slanted like a steep roof, each street a terrace. During
the zephyrs all sorts of possessions came rolling downhill like
tumbleweeds. They ranged in size from a spool of thread to the roof of a
house.

Scot McClintock, working his way along B Street, took refuge in a
hurdy-gurdy[7] near Union. The noise of a piano, of fiddles, of stamping
feet, filled the hall. The place was flooded with light from kerosene
lamps set in candelabras with crystal pendants. At one side of the room
was the inevitable bar.

-----

[7] An unusual feature of Virginia City was the hurdy-gurdy house. In
the early days it was quite respectable, at least from the Western point
of view. The girls were generally Germans. Their business was to dance
with the miners and to lead them afterwards to the bar for a drink. Most
of the girls saved their money to send home to their parents overseas.
Serious-minded young women, they often married well and happily. Later,
these houses degenerated.W. M. R.

A blonde young woman of Teutonic descent joined Scot. Would you like to
dance, Mr. McClintock? she asked deferentially.

Not to-night, thank you, he answered with the grave respect he gave
all women.

His glance swept the hall, was arrested at a small group near the
farther end of the bar. The central figure of it was a huge
rough-bearded man with long hair flowing to his shoulders. He wore an
army overcoat, dusty boots, and Mexican spurs.

The girls eyes gave a signal of alarm. She had forgotten for the moment
about the affair between the McClintocks and Sam Dutch.

First time hes been down, she whispered. He has not yet seen you
already. If you likethe door

Scot smiled grimly. He had a picture of himself slipping out of the door
to avoid Sam Dutch.

It was his temperament always to take the bull by the horns. He stepped
across the dance floor to the bar, and stood at the elbow of the
desperado.

Dutch, clinking glasses with a girl, looked round to see his enemy
before him. He was taken at a disadvantage. Was this a trap set for him?
If he made a move would the younger McClintock or some other ally of the
gambler fill him full of slugs? Nervously his eyes stole round the big
room. They came back to the clean, straight figure standing in front of
him.

No place for you, Dutch, the faro dealer said curtly. Not good for
your health. Youve got a weak heart, you know. Its likely to stop
working altogether if youre not careful of yourself. Go
homenowright awayand stay there till the stage leaves. This is an
unhealthy altitude for you. Try Aurora or Dayton.

The bad man moistened his dry lips with his tongue. Tiny beads of
moisture stood out on his forehead. He had come to the parting of the
ways and knew it. If he let this man drive him from the house he could
never hold up his head in Virginia again. His reign as chief would be
ended here. Should he take a chance and draw? He had killed many men.
This gambler, so far as he knew, had never got one. Why not now? This
very instant. It would all be over in a flash.

And yethe could not do it. With McClintocks cold and steely stare in
his he could not drop the glass from his hand and reach for a revolver.
The wills of the two clashed, fought out the battle, and the stronger
won.
