SCENE:
XLVIII

IN SEARCH


STRICTLY speaking the discovery of the truant was due to Mrs. Trimwell.
David and Elizabeth were merely her agents in the matter.

It came about in this way.

They had set off hot-foot on the search. Passing the White Cottage,
they had seen Mrs. Trimwell at the garden gate. She greeted their
approach with eagerness. It was obvious that she had certain
information to impart, information which she considered of the first
importance. Therefore, with politely restrained impatience, they paused
to hear it.

Them two, she announced, with a faint trace of injury in her voice,
and meaning John and Rosamund, was gone before I could as much as
get a word in edgeways, else Id have given them a notion on the
matter. You mark my words there aint never no mischiefness nor
troublesomeness afoot but what Molly Biddulph aint at the bottom of
it. Find Molly and youll be finding the little master.

Elizabeth smiled patiently.

Exactly, she remarked, but, without wishing to be pessimistic, I
really cannot see that it will be in the smallest degree easier to find
Molly than to find Master Antony.

Mrs. Trimwell looked at her pityingly.

Bless you, maam, I wasnt going to give you a notion what was that
jumbled there wasnt no end to take hold of to unwind it by, so to
speak. Its little use a notion of that sort would be. I see Molly
going by here about half-past seven or thereabouts, with a tin can,
a brown paper parcel, a willow stick with a bit of string to it, and
saying her prayers out of a morsel of a book.

Yes? queried Elizabeth; while David looked his doubts. For the life
of them they could see no connection between Molly passing the cottage
at that hour, and any possible clue to the matter on hand.

Mrs. Trimwell smiled oracularly. She perceived their doubts well enough.

The little book, quoth she meant that Molly was off to Mass. I
aint known Molly from babyhood for nothing. The parcel meant as she
was taking her dinner with her, being off on the spree like for the
day. The tin and the willow stick means fishing in the river. Not that
she ever catches anything as I knows on.

Oh! said Elizabeth. She was beginning to see light. David laughed.

Like as not shell have happened on the little master, announced
Mrs. Trimwell, and took him along with her. Leastways I for one dont
believe hes ever gone off on his own account. You try the river, and
up the river, mind. I see Miss Rosamund and Mr. Mortimer going off down
the river. Tis too wide and open there for Molly. Shell go for the
shallower parts up to Hurst Lea Woods, Ill be bound.

Here at least was something to go on, some conceivable possibility.
Nay, to Elizabeths mind, and to Davids mind, it began to present
itself in the light of a probability. At all events for present
purposes it might be desirable to regard it as such.

You go to Hurst Lea Woods, nodded Mrs. Trimwell emphatically once
more.

We will, agreed David briefly.

A moment later they were on their way.

Taking their route first through the village, they presently turned
sharply to the right, past a smiths forge, where a big cart horse
was being newly shod, and down a lane. Here, again to the right, they
came upon a stile set in a blackberry hedge. Surmounting it, they
found themselves in a meadow, while facing them, blue and hazy in the
distance lay Hurst Lea Woods. So far, at least, their course was clear.

A quarter of an hours walking brought them to the river, and the woods
on its opposite bank. To the left lay the moorland which it skirted;
to the right lay meadows through which it flowed; and, some mile or
so distant, the high road between Malford and Whortley. Here the river
passed beneath a stone bridge, again seeking the meadows, through which
it made a great bend southwards. Bending again to the left along its
meadow route, it finally, with another southward bend, emptied itself
into the sea, at a small village some five miles to the east of Malford.

Here, below the woods, it ran amber-coloured and shallow, brown
stones cropping up above its surface. Rushes and ferns bordered it;
ragged-robin grew in great pink patches in the meadows lying along its
southern bank. On its northern bank were the woods stretching upwards,
dark, shadowed, mysterious.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

David and Elizabeth are searching for Antony, who has gone missing. They are directed to the river by Mrs. Trimwell, who tells them that Molly Biddulph, a local girl, is likely to have found him. They find the river and begin to search along its banks.
