What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
But I shant know where to write to you.

I will let you know. And mind, William, you are not to drink--at
least, not like the others!

All right; I wont. I may smoke, maynt I?

Oh, yes, you may smoke, and you may ride and fish and shoot as much as
you like; only do try to read a little, and dont swear quite so much
as Wilfred or Harry.

All right. You dont mind my saying a big, big D---- when I get a bad
fall just before the finish?

N--o, Ill pass that. Now get down; the train is going, and you will
be hurt.

William jumped off, but dashed down the platform beside the moving
train a minute after, panting out, as he threw his purse into the
carriage:

You must take it; Ive taken out all I want, and you may want it. You
know I took first-class when you said second. Write.

The last impression she carried away of her life at the Grange was the
memory of the big, handsome boy standing looking at the disappearing
train, with an expression on his face which threatened tears when he
should be out of sight of the busy crowd around him.

When Annies own tears had stopped, she picked up the boys purse,
which had fallen as he flung it, on to the opposite seat. It was a
handsome purse and pocket-book, given him by his mother; but it had
suffered from experiments made upon it with the various articles in
his tool-chest. He had begun a diary in it when it was new, which had
dwindled down to an occasional note of his transactions in rabbits.
There were other boyish documents, a cutting from the _Field_, _et
cetera_, and there was more than five pounds in money, a broken
scarf-pin, and two used foreign postage-stamps. She had no scruples
about accepting the money, which was a welcome addition to her not
very large store, and the pocket-book she put in her desk later as a
cherished _souvenir_ of the being she cared most about in the world.
The boys high spirits and frank pleasure in hers had won her from
the first, and the only things she regretted in her life at the
Grange were the walks and drives and barbaric sports of ratting and
mouse-bunting with him as a companion.

When she got to London, she went straight to a street she had been told
of, north of Oxford Street, well known for cheap lodgings. She took a
furnished bedroom at the top of a dingy house, and then next day she
returned to Euston Station to fetch her luggage, which she had left
at the parcels-office there, for fear of the extra expense of driving
about in a cab with it, in case she should have any difficulty in
finding a suitable lodging. She was on foot; and, as she entered the
station, a hansom passed her with a young man in it who quite startled
her by his likeness to Harry. The resemblance was so strong that she
stopped, half inclined to turn back and walk about for a little while,
in case it should be, indeed, her husband, so that he might have left
the station before she got there. But then she reasoned with herself
that Harry was in Leicestershire, and was expected at Garstone to-day,
even if he were not already there; so that she decided to go boldly
on. Another feeling impelled her forward--an unacknowledged hankering
for a last sight of her husband, or even for a look at the man who so
strongly resembled him.

Annie did not love her husband--she had never really loved him; and
since Christmas she almost hated him. But, now that she had left him
forever, and that too without any farewell, a natural inconsistency
prompted her to try to steal a last look at the handsome lad who had
been her lord and master.

So she went into the station, and, leaving her luggage for future
consideration, looked about cautiously for the man she had seen in
the hansom. He was not to be seen about the ticket offices, and,
growing bolder, she slipped in and out among the groups of people on
the platform. A train was about to start for the North. Still with
caution, but attracted in spite of herself toward that train, which, as
she knew, would stop at Beckham, Annie advanced until she was nearly
opposite to the doors of the refreshment-room. They opened, and a young
man came out. Annie stopped, with the color rushing to her face; for
it was Harry. He looked so handsome in his light traveling-suit, with
his overcoat hanging loosely over his arm, that she felt quite proud of
him, and stood there with her eyes fixed upon him, half hoping that he
would turn and see her.

But he did not, for he was gazing eagerly in the opposite direction--so
eagerly that he risked being left behind, as the carriage doors were
being closed. Annies eyes followed his, and found that the object of
his evident admiration was a showily-dressed woman with bold eyes and
impossibly yellow hair, who was tottering along the platform in boots
which had long slender pegs instead of heels.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of William and Annie. William is a high-spirited boy who is careless and doesn't always think things through. Annie is a more level-headed girl who is trying to make the best of her situation. The author also establishes the setting of the story and the conflict between the two characters.
