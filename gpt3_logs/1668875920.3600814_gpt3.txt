SCENE:
XXIII


Leaning alternately to right and to left to meet the roll of the ship,
Ouro Preto made his way along the deck of the Southern Cross, his eyes
fixed on a vacant chair by Lillian Byrds side. Miss Byrd saw him
coming, and longed to escape, but could not do so.

She did not wish to talk with the count, although she had come on board
the Southern Cross at Buenos Ayres for the express purpose of obtaining
from him certain knowledge that she felt sure that he possessed.
For three weeks she had been working, quietly and unobtrusively but
effectively, to gain it, and when she saw him approaching she felt that
success was about to crown her efforts.

Yet in that moment of prospective triumph contrition seized her, and
she looked down, panic-stricken, striving to gain time.

Dismayed, she asked herself why she should hesitate. It was not from
any pity for Ouro Preto. Pity is the only for the weak and Ouro
Preto was not weak. Nor did her hesitation arise from sympathy or
friendship. Miss Byrd was experienced enough to know that no woman
could feel either sympathy or friendship for Ouro Preto except at
her peril; besides, she told herself that she did not even like him.
His attitude toward her irritated her; and his pride, based on his
fathers wealth and his mothers ancestry, was as offensive as it was
unconscious.

Nor was she ashamed of her work; at least, she had never been so before.

Miss Byrd did not know why she hesitated and the fact that she did
hesitate both angered and frightened her.

Ouro Preto did not realize the situation. His admiration for Miss Byrd
had begun long before in Berlin and had steadily increased since the
day he had come on board the Southern Cross and found her, and had
grown intense as the voyage wore on. When the ship reached Barbadoes,
at which island he had expected to transfer to his own yacht, which had
come from Hamburg to meet him, he had been unable to tear himself away
from the fascinating American and had decided to go on to New York on
the Southern Cross and sail for Germany from there. Again and again he
had striven to place his relations with her on a sentimental footing,
but always she evaded him, and the closing days of the voyage found
him uncertain as to her feelings and determined to bring matters to a
climax. He never guessed that it was on just this that Miss Byrd was
counting.

When he reached her chair, he stood over it until he forced her to
raise her eyes. Then he bowed. May I sit down? he asked.

For a moment the girl did not answer. Then she put out her hand and
pushed the chair near her an inch or two farther away. The chair
belongs to the ship and the deck belongs to whomever occupies it, she
replied coldly, though her heart was fluttering.

The smile faded from Ouro Pretos face. Oh! but why are you so cruel,
he cried, wildly. What have I done to anger you? Is it that my love
offends you?

Miss Byrd gasped. I am not offended at all, she answered briskly,
ignoring the suggestion in the young fellows last words. I am merely
tired--bored if you will--by the length of this never-ending voyage. I
am a very bad-tempered young woman, senor; and if you knew me at all
well you would realize how unpleasant I am likely to be when I am
bored. The girl spoke hurriedly, feeling for words which would not be
too rude and which might yet stave off the proposal which she felt was
imminent.

But Ouro Preto was not to be stopped. I do not believe it, senorita,
he babbled. No, I do not believe it. You are altogether sweet and
lovely--fit for a duchess. And I can make you one, senorita. Great
things are impending. A few weeks more and I will be a duke and--

His words steadied the girl. Stop! she cried. I will not listen. I
am not the inexperienced girl you think me. I am--

You are the one woman for me. You do not love me, senorita. I know it.
But I can teach you to love me if you will give me the chance. And I
can give you much--much. I do not speak of money--no! no! do not think
of it! Money is nothing! I can give you more than money. I can give you
position, rank, fame.

Miss Byrd forced a laugh. Where? she demanded. In Brazil?

In Brazil, yes, at first; then where you will. Listen, senorita, my
mother is descended from the princely German house of Hochstein, now
extinct in the male line. The emperor is about to revive its honors
and vest them in me--in me, do you understand. And this is not all.
I am at the head of a great movement. Since I was a boy of sixteen I
have been laboring for it, and now at last the time is ripe. Only one
obstacle remains, and I am about to sweep it aside. Then--then--
