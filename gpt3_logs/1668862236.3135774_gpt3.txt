SCENE:
XII.

THE PARTISAN.


At the sight of the Indians, the American Rangers instinctively
clustered together, and the flankers came galloping in.

That the enemy were in force was evident from the boldness with which
they showed themselves, coming running out, and spreading into a long
skirmish line, that threatened to cut off the rangers from any return
to their own army.

It was evident that they were in a trap from which there was no escape,
except by cutting their way out, twenty white men against nearly a
hundred Indians. The hunters that followed Adrian, bold as they were
by nature, began to evince symptoms of shrinking from the test. Brave
militia, as far as service in war went, they were as yet only the raw
stuff that veterans are made of. Many cheeks were pale, and there was
much nervous fumbling at weapons, but they kept silence and anxiously
watched the countenance of their young leader for advice and succor.

Adrian Schuyler had not served, as volunteer and officer, in the famous
corps of the Zieten Hussars, without profiting by the counsels of the
best leaders of light cavalry in Europe. He scanned the advancing line
of the enemy with great coolness, riding out in front of his men, and
using his telescope.

His example was inspiring to his men, and insensibly the most nervous
forgot his tremors when he saw the coolness of his captain.

The Indians were as yet out of gunshot, they were advancing on foot,
and some five or six horsemen were visible in their line. Adrian
watched them close, and saw that if he could break through the line he
could laugh at pursuit, all his men being mounted and most of the enemy
on foot. He turned his glass to the Hessian camp, and saw no symptoms
of disturbance there. The stolid dragoon sentries paced to and fro on
the parapet of the breastwork, and did not seem to notice the impending
conflict outside.

Then he turned to speak to his men, and met the blue eyes of Diana.
She was watching him apprehensively, as if she sympathized with his
danger, and longed to avert it, while powerless. Schuyler pointed to
the distant woods, saying:

For Gods sake, young lady, ride away out of danger. The bullets will
soon be flying, and they will not respect even your beauty.

Why not come with me? she asked. I can lead you away by a path where
there are no Indians.

Thanks for your offer, said the hussar, gratefully. It is one that I
would accept, were it not that I have promised General Stark to be back
by a certain hour at his headquarters. My way lies through the enemy.

And do you really mean to charge those fierce creatures? she asked in
a tone of wonder.

I really do, he said, quietly. Theres not half as much danger as
you would think. Rapid motion will take us safe through.

Then I go with you, said the girl, firmly.

Adrian laughed.

Nonsense, Diana. Your presence here shows that youre on our side,
but you can do no good with us. Depart while you may. They are almost
within gunshot.

I am going with you, said Diana, firmly. If it is a mere matter of
fast riding, I can ride too.

But you may escape by going the other way, objected Schuyler.

Which I shall not do, she said. Ive taken a fancy to see what you
soldiers call a battle, and you can not stop me, so you may as well
attend to your men.

The hussar shrugged his shoulders, and turned away to his followers,
just as several white puffs of smoke came from the enemys skirmishers,
followed by the thump, thump, of two or three bullets, tearing up the
earth around them. The horses began to fidget, and the faces of the men
were somewhat uneasy. Adrian saw that they must be encouraged at once,
or possibly desert in confusion.

He drew his sword and threw back the dripping cloak from his arm, while
he spoke to the rangers.

Men, he said, its time we were doing something. Never flinch from a
few bullets at long range. Those fellows are firing to no purpose. Fall
in, and deploy as skirmishers.
