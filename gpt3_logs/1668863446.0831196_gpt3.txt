SCENE:
To-morrow, then, said Jean, with a deep sigh, I think I will go and
ask if they will take me on again. But Jean never quite knew how he
had arrived at this decision. Margot sighed, too; but hers was a sigh
of relief.

What troubles me most, Margot, Jean went on, is that I took from you
your part at the Odon. She might have done anything else. I did not
grudge her pleasure in destroying my chances if she had left you your
part. That, said Jean, staring hard at his boot, was not generous of
Liane. He had never spoken her name to Margot before.

Margot drew a quick breath and laid her small brown hand on Jeans arm.

Dont throw your life away, Jean, she pleaded in a low tone. You
look so thin and you cant eat, and at night I hear you walking about,
walking about--till dawn sometimes. Is that the way to forget? She
looked up at him suddenly, her brown eyes filled with gentleness and
love. Is there no other way? she said.

Jean glanced at her for a moment and then looked away. He knew well
enough what other way there was; he was not by nature a vain man; he
was more dangerous to women than that, he was intuitively perceptive.
Margots secret had long ago slipped into Jeans heart, and he had
turned the key on it in silence. Was he always to keep it locked up?
he asked himself. He wanted to kneel beside her and press his tired
head against her tender breast. Surely to feel her arms about him,
and to drink close and deep of the light in her eyes would help to
heal the hideous ache Liane had left behind! And did he not owe Margot
something? Was she always to love without reward? He hesitated, but
still he did not look at her.

Margots whole soul was in her eyes fixed on him wondering and
worshipping; she could have drawn him to her that night if she had
known how; but she did not know how. She was not thinking of herself,
which would have taught her--she was thinking of him; and all that that
taught her was to wait upon his wishes; so she sat there, poor little
Margot, praying God to help Jean; and it is possible that God heard.

It is late, Margot, Jean said at last, in a low tone. Doesnt your
mother want you?

Mamma is asleep, said Margot.

I wont play any more to-night then, said Jean.

And there is something else too, Jean, that I wanted to tell you, but
I didnt like to come in and interrupt you before. Its rather good
news this time.

Lets have it, then, said Jean, laughing, a short, hard laugh. Lets
have all the good news we can get, Margot. Perhaps it will make up--the
good news--for all the things we cant get--or are fools enough, he
added half to himself, not to take.

Well, its an engagement, said Margot excitedly. And the terms
are better than Ive ever been offered; its every night for three
months--at twice my usual salary.

Jean sprang forward and caught both her hands; it was months since he
had looked at her with such delight.

Oh, but Im glad, Margot! he said, and to-morrow we will celebrate
the occasion. I will take you out and you shall dine as you have never
dined before, and then well go to the Opera, and hear the big women
sing, women who will one day listen to you--they will have nothing
but a little squeak then and a grand manner, and you will have all
the melody and all the strength of all the world in that little white
throat of yours.

Margot flushed up to her eyes with pleasure; her throat was not really
white, it was rather brown, but the programme was splendid.

How pleased you are, Jean, she said wonderingly. I did not know you
would be so pleased.

Oh, Im not only glad, said Jean, stopping in front of her with
shining eyes, Im relieved. Just think! you have got back what I
took away from you and more! Ah! if you knew how bitterly I have been
feeling all you have done for me. Couldnt you see I was almost ashamed
to look at you?

He put his hands on her shoulders and shook her gently. His selfishness
fell away from him; she was his comrade again, his good, kind little
comrade with whom he lived on equal terms, and whom he would die for
rather than wrong. Margot wrenched herself free from him; to Jeans
surprise a cloud had come into her eyes.

So that was it, she said slowly. I see! She turned back to the
piano and began to pick up the music Jeans impulsive movement had
flung to the floor; he could not see her face.
