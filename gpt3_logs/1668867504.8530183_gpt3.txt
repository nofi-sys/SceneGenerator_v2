Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Could it be possible for a hole to be punched in the outside shell of
our bully little boat? Ballyhoo wanted to know, and his voice quivered
as he asked it.

Hardly a likely thing, Oscar told him. But what Im really afraid of
is that our engines may be knocked galley-west and hurt so badly that
the engineer cant possibly repair the same.

As a last resort, Jack added, seriously enough, theres a way of
getting out of here through a chamber that can be emptied of water
again and again. And once on the surface a fellow could swim to the
island all right enough. So you see it hasnt got to the desperate
stage.

One of us ought to try and find out what happened, dont you think?
asked Jack.

Let Oscar do it, suggested Ballyhoo; for somehow it seemed that when
something really important had to be carried through the Jones boy felt
considerable more confidence in Oscars ability than in his own.

All right, I will, promptly spoke up the one indicated. Both of you
stay here so as not to get in the way. This is a tight fit, you must
remember, and any useless confusion would be next door to criminal.
Ill be back in a jiffy; the chances are nothing so terrible has
happened.

With that he left them. Jack and Ballyhoo waited impatiently for his
return, and, of course, conjectured all sorts of miserable things.
Still, their spirits began to brighten in some degree when they noticed
that pretty much all the furore had by now died down.

Guess were not taking in water _very_ fast, anyhow, said Ballyhoo
bravely.

I havent seen or felt any leak, agreed Jack, just as if such a thing
as flooding the little compartment where they had their bunks were
possible without a panic among the crew.

Then came Oscar almost crawling back to them, because passing from one
part of the boat to another necessitated considerable of this sort of
thing.

Its good news hes fetching us, I warrant you! exclaimed the eager
Ballyhoo, because I can see his face all wrinkled up in a smile.

Oscar sank down beside them.

Well, it seems that we certainly butted into something or other that
was quite hidden in among that extra big patch of submarine imitation
trees, he commenced. The captain doesnt know just yet whether any
damage was done, but they havent discovered that were taking on any
water, and that is a comfort.

Bully! zipped Ballyhoo, drawing in a big breath of relief.

And the engines, how about them? demanded Jack.

Oh! he said they were all right, Oscar told him. The engineer shut
off power the very instant we rebounded.

Lucky we were going pretty slow at the time, too, Jack added. If
wed been racing along at top speed it would have been good-night for
everybody by now.

What do you suppose it was we struck? asked Ballyhoo.

Oh! one of those queer ledges that weve had to climb over several
times before this, Jack went on to say. The floor of the ocean isnt
always like a level plain, you know. Sometimes there are hills, and
then deep valleys, just as we have them on the land.

Somehow or other, continued Oscar, Captain Shooks doesnt quite
believe it was hard rock we struck. He says it didnt just feel like
it. Still, down in this section theres a heap of coquina rock, which
you know is really made by myriads of insects building. It looks like
a mass of tiny shells welded together with some sort of cement. The
skipper says coquina rock is lots softer than ordinary stone. It may
have been a bank of that we ran smack up against.

Lets hope so, anyhow, said Ballyhoo fervently, because to have
anything injure our boat at this early stage of the game would be
terrible. Jack here has only begun to take his under-the-sea motion
pictures; and then again nary a cent have the treasure hunters found up
to now, to help pay the e_nor_mous expenses of the enterprise.

There, the engines are working again, remarked Oscar. I suppose
the next move will be to draw back out of this mess of giant ferns
and other plants ten or twenty feet high. Theyre all around us, you
notice, boys.


BRIEF OUTLINE:

==========

-The scene takes place on a submarine, which has just hit something and is taking on water.
-Oscar goes to investigate and comes back with good news: the damage isn't too bad and they're not taking on water.
-The next move is to back out of the mess of plants they're in.
