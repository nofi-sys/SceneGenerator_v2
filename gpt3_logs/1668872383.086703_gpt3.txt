SCENE:
"I'm afraid I most stop to explain matters at this point, _ami_, or you
may find the rest incomprehensible. No doubt you are asking yourself:
'How it could ever have come about that a will like Aurora's could have
yielded? What could this invisible and powerful Frederick-Augustus have
done to get the Empress, Rudolph's godmother, and the Kaiser on his
side?'

"I expect you read your foreign news carefully enough in 1909 to know
that about that time the Eulenburg affair and a Moltke-Harden case were
causing a considerable stir in German Court circles. Personally, the way
these folk took their pleasures was a matter of indifference to me. What
strikes me as monstrous is the fact that these scandals had a
considerable effect on my fortunes.

"Frederick-Augustus seldom stayed at Lautenburg in his brother's
lifetime. I only saw him three or four times, the first occasion being
my wedding, and the second, six months later, the funeral of his wife, a
worthy but stupid woman with wrists like a scullery-maid's. His Serene
Highness your pupil is hardly more intelligent than she.

"The rest of his time was spent in Berlin. The man you have
seen so reserved and formal led a very gay life there. Never
believe those who tell you that profligacy is harmful _ami_. The
rise of Frederick-Augustus is proof to the contrary.

"The one thing in which the present Grand Duke is past-master is the art
of compromising others without compromising himself. He made ample use
of it at Berlin in 1909. Intimate with the Blows, and a bosom friend
of Eitel and Joachim, he alone could tell you the scenes in which he
figured at that time. But he will never tell you, _ami_, just as he has
never told me, as neither you nor I will ever be able to pay the price
of his confidences. Why, it was his silence alone that gained him the
grand-ducal crown, and may one day bring him the throne of Wrtemberg.
When the Empress, with quivering voice, was preaching the virtue of
submission to my destiny, the honest dame was only defending the honour
of two of her sons.

"The brain fever that followed the receipt of my father's telegram
lasted a month, during which I hung between life and death, while
Melusine and Hagen, with a devotion I shall never forget, took turns in
nursing me night and day.

"At length I was convalescent. My hair had been cut off. I was thin but
still pretty. One day, while I was studying in my mirror the pathetic
figure I looked with the little fair curls clustering on my head, Hagen,
who was on orderly duty, came in and announced Duke Frederick-Augustus.

"I was still really too ill to receive him, but I was longing for the
encounter. I must confess, to my shame, that I didn't come out on top
that day.

"He came in and bowed ceremoniously. His blue eyes, in his pale, smooth
face, were bright and dim by turns.

"'My dear sister, what a pleasure to find you up at last, and looking so
well.'

"His perfect ease of manner froze me. He went on:

"'There is no point in not telling you at once the pleasant object of my
visit. Tomorrow it will be nine months since the death of my regretted
brother, the Grand Duke Rudolph. As the legal period of your widowhood
then expires their Majesties the Emperor and Empress would be glad if
you could see your way to fix a convenient date for the celebration of
our marriage. They have expressed their intention of being present.'

"'Tell their Majesties, my dear brother,' I replied, 'that I will fix
any date that suits their pleasure, and kindly add that I hope it will
be the last time I shall give them this trouble.'

"He bowed gravely.

"'That is also my heart-felt desire, dear sister,' he said.

"And he went out.

"We were married one day in March, 1912, a dull, threatening day. The
Emperor and Empress, true to their promise, were present at the
religious ceremony and left for Berlin in the evening. About five
o'clock, first at the Rathaus and then at the castle, the State
authorities and magistrates took the oath of fealty to the new Grand
Duke. At eight the superior officers and higher dignitaries of the Grand
Duchy, some thirty guests, were present at a dinner, informal on account
of our recent mourning, in the banqueting-hall on the ground floor.

"The second course had hardly begun when the sound of tapping, now loud,
now soft, was heard coming from the first floor, immediately above our
heads.

"At first no notice was taken. But the noise continued, tap, tap, tap,
with exasperating regularity.
