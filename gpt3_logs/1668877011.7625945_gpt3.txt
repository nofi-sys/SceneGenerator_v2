SCENE:
Nick viewed him speculatively and then dropped his gaze to the bundle.
I wouldnt want to expose them to the air, Jimmy. They get stale so
soon, you see. But Ill describe them to you. Theyre big and fat and
sort of a lovely golden-brown color, and theyve got sugar sprinkled
on their circumferences, so to speak. Honest, Jimmy, theyre awfully
_tasty_ doughnuts. Youd like em, I feel sure.

Stingy brute! Come across, Nick. Im as hungry as a bear. Youve got
plenty, Ill bet.

Depends, replied Nick, clasping his hands about his knees, what you
call plenty. Weve got only a dozen.

You can have a couple of my six, laughed Hugh, reaching for the
luncheon.

One moment, interposed Nick. Tell you what, Ighness. Here we are
with more food than we can eat, and here are two famished mariners
miles from port. Whats the answer?

Why, we invite them to dinner, of course.

Correct! Turn your old tub around, Jimmy, and paddle back to the
willows and well go ashore and have a banquet. Weve only got three
chops, but theres lots of bread and butter and some cheese and a can
of peaches. Only we forgot to bring an opener, and so I dont just
see You dont happen to carry a can-opener with you, do you Baker?

No, but I think I can-opener without one, replied Dud.

Wow! said Jimmy.

Nick turned with great difficulty and viewed Dud reproachfully. You
shouldnt do that, he said. I dont mind for myself. Im strong. But
Hugh here wont get that before tomorrow morning at eleven-thirty-nine,
and meanwhile he will puzzle that poor English bean of his and get
faint and dizzy. You shouldnt, Baker, you shouldnt!

Get what? asked Hugh innocently.

Jimmy laughed and Nick nodded sorrowfully at him. Listen, Ighness,
he explained patiently. It was like this. I asked Baker if he carried
a can-opener with him. Get that?

Perfectly. And he said he could open it without one. Whats the joke?

Nick cast his hands aside hopelessly. Whats the use? Whats the use?
he demanded. Come on and lets paddle. Im sta-a-arved!

How about getting back for supper? inquired Jimmy. Its way after
five now.

We get lost or we have an upset or something, rejoined Nick
carelessly. We discussed that, but I forget now just what we decided.

Thats all right for you, objected Jimmy as he and Dud swung their
craft around, but what about us? We cant all get upset?

Why not? asked Nick, reaching for his paddle. Theres plenty of
water, isnt there?

But, I say, Nick, remonstrated Hugh, if we tell them we were upset
well have to get our clothes wet, eh?

Um, thats so. I hadnt thought of that. Oh, well, never mind now.
Well think up something going back.

We might let the canoes get away from us and have to chase them,
suggested Dud.

Perfect! applauded Nick. Baker, you have a great mind. Tell you
what, my hearties. After we get to the willows well carelessly let the
canoes get away, see? Then well catch em further downstream. They
wont ask us how _far_ we had to chase em. Even if they do we can be
vague.

Maybe wed better try to get back on time, said Hugh.

Squealer! Nick, in the stern, reproachfully splashed Hughs back.
Theres no fun picnicking if you have to go home right away and eat
another meal.

Oh, all right, old chap, agreed Hugh. Only dont throw any more
water down my neck. Its beastly cold.

There was silence then for a few minutes while the two canoes passed
leisurely down the winding stream, side by side. Westward, the sun
was dropping close to the greening summit of the low hills and the
April day was almost at its end. There was a perceptible chill in the
little breeze that crept across the meadows and made catspaws on the
quiet surface of the water. Early blackbirds were fluttering along the
banks ahead of the canoes, uttering their creaky notes and simulating
wild alarm. A fish leaped after a reckless insect and fell back with a
startling splash, sending widening circles away in the amber glow. They
didnt paddle much, for there was enough current to bear them along.
Jimmy frankly shipped his blade and watched the drops trickle. Nicks
voice came across the few yards of water.
