SCENE:
Dont ask me, said Fay.

He paid ten pounds fine, I think, and disappeared. Now, you say, he was
on the boats with smoked-glasses. Then those glasses had some close
relation to the cards. I think were getting there

Sir Richards right fingers crept to his vest pocket in abstraction. He
stared at Saidee Isaacs and then dropped his eyes toward his vest. He
brought out a small ring upon which was a single flat key. He toyed with
this key as MacKeenon crept forward with the loose pouches of his
leathern jaw hanging down.

Bring me the boxes! he said, pointing toward the three tin boxes which
stood at the end of the table.

MacKeenon set them in front of Sir Richard.

It may be, Mac, said the chief. It may be that we have reached the
end of the quest. There is something in what Fay has told us, after all.
Hes a bungler and a fool and all o that, but he has enterprise.
Suppose you go back to the coach house and tell the driver to give you
those goggles from out the side pocket of the tonneau of the car that
brought you down. I think I heard him take the car around the house.
Tell him I want all of the goggles he has got.

The inspector glanced at Fay.

Go on, said Sir Richard, Ill watch him.

Now you, Fay, the chief continued as MacKeenon unlocked the door and
vanished through the hallway. Fay, you cant steal! Youre a shining
mark for us. Youve got the nerve of the damnedbut you overlook the
essential trifles. That finger-print up over the transom in Hatton
Gardensfor instance. The dropped hotel-key in Chicagowasnt it? And
now the smoked-glasses. You should not have thrown them away.

She told me I shouldnt have done it, said Fay, turning toward Saidee
Isaacs. He was surprised to notice that the girl had stepped halfway
toward the door. Her eyes turned swiftly away from a spot on the wall.
She nodded her head as Sir Richard glanced keenly at her.

She told you, eh? She was right. A womans intuition is a sound compass
to steer by. Saidee has a clever brainwhen she uses it. She helped get
these for us.

Sir Richard pointed toward the first tin box. She aided in getting them
through Switzerland. She did wellbut they are scraps of paper without
the key that will solve them. That key may lie in the smoked-glasses. It
may go deeper than that. You thought it was a trifle. Let me tell you,
candidly, there are no trifles in this world. What do you wager that the
trifle you threw away solves the secret of the entire German dye
industry?

About three minutes start that it doesnt, said Fay as he glanced at
the girl out of the corners of his eyes.

Sir Richard rubbed his hands and picked up the nearest box. He inserted
the key as the little old man crept out of the gloom and came toward the
table. Saidee Isaacs took one step in the direction of the door and the
wainscoting near the chamfering. She stood pensively, with her hands at
her sides as MacKeenon glided into the room and tossed a pair of
yellow-tinted goggles upon the table.

Sir Richard picked up these goggles and lifted a sheet of paper out of
the box. He held the glasses in one handthe paper in the other. His
eyes traveled over the lines of typing. He adjusted the goggles and
leaned his head forward.

Slowly the chiefs gaze ran from left to right and back again along the
sheet. He fingered the goggles abstractedly. He moved his eyes closer to
the page. He drew them awaya foot or more.

Not smoked enough, he said musingly. These glasses wont do, Im
afraid. Theyre very weak. Very weak indeed.

Fay stood on the balls of his feet. He thrust a hand halfway out toward
his cap which was between MacKeenon and the little old man. He waited
then with every nerve strained to the leaping point.

Sir Richard glanced at the electric cluster, blinked his eyes, then
resumed his scrutiny through the goggles of the typed page. He lifted a
second sheet and peered at this. He seemed, to the poised cracksman,
like a scientist examining a beetle with a double microscope. His brow
darkened with a welling frown of annoyance. His chin lifted slightly.
His glance darted toward Fay in final resolution. His eyes flamed.

Mac, you may take him back to he started to say when Saidee Isaacs
fingers closed over the black knob of the switch which controlled all of
the lights in the room. A click sounded like a revolver being cocked.
The place was plunged into inky darkness. An exclamation of surprise
came from the two detectives. This was followed by a gasp from Sir
Richard. This last was mingled exasperation and wonder.
