SCENE:
IV.


But he did not quite know Frederick Walcheren. Perhaps, also, he did
not how know cunning Love makes a man. The younger man had assumed his
overcoat and hat, and gone forth at the hall door, as if he had but one
intention--to seek the railway station, since his brougham had returned
to town. But, once clear of the scrutiny of the servants, he skirted
the house on the left side, and passed from the front garden to the
back, which is easily done in most suburban houses. This brought him
on to a large lawn, from which the interior of the lighted ballroom
might be easily seen through the open windows. Also, by turning the
other corner of the mansion, he could, by pressing his face against
the glass, see if the picture gallery was occupied or not, though he
remained himself unseen. The windows of this room were also thrown
open, and Frederick waited at one of them until he saw the white-robed
figure of Jenny Crampton steal in, and glance furtively around as if in
search of him.

Jenny, Jenny, he called softly, lest she should be followed by the
friend of the family, Jenny, my love, come here, to this window.

What is this? cried the girl as she perceived him; why are you here?
Is anything wrong?

Nothing is wrong whilst you love me, said Frederick, but we are
watched, darling, so I have pretended to go home again. Have you the
pluck to join me in the garden? There are any number of arbours here
where we can talk undisturbed.

Pluck, cried Jenny, jumping on the window sill, of course I have.
Pluck enough to follow you over a precipice, if you wish me to do so.

You angel. I will ask you to take no more dangerous leap than into my
arms. But were you seen? Did anyone follow you? We must not have an
open row.

No, no one even saw me leave the ballroom, for I was at the buffet
with Captain Rawson, when number five dance struck up, so I told him to
go and find his partner and leave mine to seek me out. And as soon as
his back was turned I slipped out here.

You dear girl! Give me your hand, then, and jump out; there is a
lovely seat under that acacia tree--but what will you say if your
mother asks where you have been?

That I have been strolling in the garden with my partner. She will
think it was Captain Rawson; but she will not ask. She is used to my
vagaries, and lets me do just as I choose.

But, darling, they wont let you do that any longer, Im afraid. Ive
had a lecture as well as you, Jenny. Mr Hindes followed me to the
picture gallery just now, by your fathers request, and made me promise
I would give up all pretensions to your hand, and leave off visiting at
your house.

And do you mean to keep your promise? inquired the girl, pouting.

Not unless you tell me to do so, Jenny; I love you too much for that.
I only did it to prevent a row, for if Mr Crampton carried his threat
of taking you away from Hampstead into execution, I might find it very
difficult to have any communication with you again.

But what is the good of my staying here if I am never to see you,
Fred? asked Jenny.

That depends upon yourself, my darling; you cant do it from your
fathers house, thats certain.

Whos from, then? said Jenny.

From mine, sweetheart! Dont think me very bold, but, if you love me
as you say, you will marry me whether your parents give their consent
or not.

So I will, if you will only tell me how, Fred.

We must elope together, dearest; heaps of husbands and wives have done
it before us, and been none the worse. Your father says that if you
marry without his consent, he will leave you none of his money; that is
a thing you must take into serious consideration, before you give me
your answer. I have enough for both of us, still, you would be a richer
woman if you remained your fathers heiress; his fortune cannot be less
than ten thousand a year, whilst mine is only two thousand.

What do I care for money in comparison with you, Fred? whispered
Jenny.

Thats my own true girl, he answered, folding her closely to him,
and once you have made up your mind to marry me without your fathers
consent, the rest is easy enough. Tell me to get a licence, and to give
notice at the nearest registrars office to my place, and you have only
to arrange how you can join me, so as to give us a few hours start of
Mr Crampton, and I will have you out of his reach and power before the
day is over.
