What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
You know his habits are rather irregular, and he had ridden too much
and excited himself too much, and I believe he was ill from the effects
of overexcitement. But why do you wish to know these things? You are
happily spared the wrangles and disturbances of that unlucky household
now. You have the interest of your own career to occupy your mind; it
is much better for you not to concern yourself any more with the doings
of that barbaric crew.

Dont say that. Every word you say makes me reproach myself more. I
am not heartless, though I see now how selfish it was of me to sneak
away as I did. You will hardly believe that I thought I was doing what
was best for my husband as well as myself. I thought he was too young
to be burdened with a wife. We did not suit each other; I seemed to
irritate him to worse brutality; we were spoiling each others lives
and our own.

You were quite right to come away. He would only have crushed your
life out by his coarse cruelty before now, if you had stayed with him.
How could you, with your sensitive feelings and cultivated tastes, bear
with that uncouth boor? I used to wonder at your patience with him when
I first knew you in town with him.

I was wrong, though, said Annie, gravely. If I thought I could do
him any good I would go back now.

I beg you not to do anything so rash, said Colonel Richardson,
hastily. Your husband is worse than an uncouth lad now; he is a
coarse, savage-tempered man. Lilian--Mrs. Falconer--his own sister, is
afraid of him; and you know she is not meek-spirited.

What does he say of me? Does he never speak about me? Do you know?

The last time his sister saw him he told her that, if he ever met his
wife again--and he used language which neither she nor I could repeat
to you--he would crush the beauty out of the face that made a fool of
him. Forgive my repeating his words to you; I think they will be the
best warning I can give you to keep out of his reach.

Annie sighed.

You dont make me afraid of him; you only make me pity him as I would
a fierce hound who had been unwisely treated. If Harry were to crush my
face, as he said, in a fit of passion, it would be the one thing which
would make him treat me tenderly ever afterward.

Colonel Richardson looked surprised.

You almost make me bold enough to wonder----

Why I left him? I suppose my strongest reason really was that he was
unbearable to me. His tenderness was odious as his anger, and worse
than his neglect. I should dislike him more than ever now; but I should
know how to treat him more wisely.

Colonel Richardson understood women too well to say more on that
subject. He turned the conversation.

Mrs. Falconer expects her brother William next week, he said. Shall
I bring him to the theater and see if he knows you?

Annie caught eagerly at the idea of seeing her favorite William again.
She had nothing to fear from his knowing where she was, and she was
anxious to find out whether he was growing into a less worthless man
than his brothers. He was now eighteen. She was anxious, too, to learn
whether he still retained the affectionate remembrance of her. So her
last words to Colonel Richardson were a repetition of her injunction
to bring him to the theater without any warning that he would see her.
She did not doubt that he would know her, especially as he was the one
member of the family who knew she was on the stage.

The season was nearly over now, and night after night she scanned the
audience anxiously in the hope of seeing those two faces she knew; but
it was not until the very last night of all that, as she came on to the
stage, she saw a tall young man in the stalls half rise from his seat,
with the exclamation, just loud enough for her to hear--Annie!

At the end of the street William met her, and could hardly be
restrained from embracing her, regardless of appearances. He was
broader, manlier in figure; but in his manner to her he was exactly
the same as before. She was thankful to see that he did not look
dissipated, and he hastened to assure her that he had observed all her
commands, that he read a great deal and quite liked it. He had not
lived much at Elms, having passed most of his time with his uncle, his
mothers brother, in Ireland.

And, Annie, Im not going to lead an idle life. Im going to be a
soldier.

Well, that is the next thing to it.
