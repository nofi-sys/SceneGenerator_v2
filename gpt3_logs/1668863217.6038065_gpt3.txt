Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
I think the boys taste should be considered, suggested the Cur. He
thought that he had formed Jeans taste, and that he might safely leave
it to settle matters his way.

I wish he could have done his military service, said the doctor. If
I had been the fool at the Maire de Valbranche I would have passed
him; he is delicate, but its only raw, untrained nerves and morbid
religious fancies. The old adhesion in the left lung they thought
themselves so clever in spotting, why, its nothing--nothing at all,
I tell you; just the result of that English spinsters notion of how
to treat a delicate child with measles. But there! modern science only
goes by whats at the end of a stethoscope, or a microscope, or a
misanthrope, said the doctor. He was not quite sure what a misanthrope
was; however, it sounded all right, and, after all, the Cur wouldnt
know any better. It doesnt allow for life forces.

I have often told you that, said the Cur complacently; only I
expressed it better. Science has tried to lead faith when she should
have knelt before her.

Rubbish! said the doctor.

By this time they had reached the house. Ucelles did not look quite
so grand on a near approach. The long French windows opening on the
_terrasse_ had a cold and vacant air, most of the house was closed, so
that it appeared half blind and wholly dumb; it needed all the sunshine
of summer to help the observer to bear the freezing sense of departed
life. When the doctor rang the bell it echoed hauntingly through the
empty corridors, and it was a long while before Miss Prenderghasts
reliable English maid answered it. She did at last, and received the
mens greetings with all the sourness of an exiled mind. If Miss
Prenderghast was not at home in France, Elizabeth was still less likely
to be so. Miss Prenderghast regarded it with suspicion, but Elizabeth
with open-eyed hostility. Everything was different from what Elizabeth
had been accustomed to, and Elizabeth knew that everything which was
different was wrong. But all human consistency breaks down somewhere;
Elizabeths broke down over Jean. When she first saw him he was a
little French boy, very French indeed, and a Catholic; and he was not
the less French now nor less Catholic at twenty; but Elizabeth was
human and she loved him. That was why she stayed in a heathen country.

If you will please to come this way, sir, she said, addressing the
doctor--she pretended not to see the Cur, she was Protestant to the
core; then she led them along the polished parquet corridor, till at
last they reached the smallest of a suite of reception-rooms. It was
full of sunshine and golden dust that glistened in the sunbeams between
the ceiling and the floor, but there was very little else in the room
except Miss Prenderghast; she was knitting.

You can serve lunch, Elizabeth, she said, before she greeted her
visitors.

Yes, maam, said Elizabeth, but she did not intend to serve lunch
until Jean came; her idea of veracity was as strictly relative as if
she had been a Jesuit.

Miss Prenderghasts dress was very high about the neck and rather short
about the ankles. Her nose was her most prominent feature, and she
looked as if she felt cold but would have thought it extremely foolish
to take any precautions against it.

It is easy to distinguish in the faces of the middle-aged those from
whom life has receded from those, in whose existence, it has never
played a formidable part. It was to this latter category that Miss
Prenderghast belonged. From her earliest years she had been taught to
repress all her emotions, and she had repressed them so thoroughly
that at times it seemed even to herself as if she no longer had any to
suppress. She had put her heart into her sense of duty, a performance
which had resulted in developing her conscience at the expense of
all her natural instincts. Nobody likes having to deal with a robust
conscience and anmic emotions, the Latin races least of all. The two
men, who bowed low, and obediently took the two small cane chairs
provided for them, never considered Miss Prenderghast in the light
of a human being. She appeared to them as a natural phenomenon of a
disagreeable nature, such as a land-slide or a series of bad harvests.

English ladies can have no temptations, thought the Cur. That is
why they are Protestants.

We shall have trouble with Jean sooner or later, the doctor said to
himself; he has his fathers blood in him, and he has been brought up
by a stone.

It was very kind of you both to come, said Miss Prenderghast coldly;
you must have found the walk from St. Jouin long and dusty.

On the contrary, said the doctor politely, where the destination is
agreeable the path is scattered with flowers.

The wild flowers in this part of the country are remarkably scarce,
observed Miss Prenderghast. I have often regretted it.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with the Cur (a Catholic priest) and the doctor discussing the latter's military service. The Cur suggests that the doctor's taste should be considered, as he has formed Jean's taste. The doctor wishes that Jean had done his military service, as he is delicate. The two men then discuss science and faith, with the doctor asserting that science has tried to lead faith when it should have knelt before her.
They arrive at the house of Miss Prenderghast, an English spinster, and are greeted by her sour maid, Elizabeth. Elizabeth leads them to a small reception room, where they find Miss Prenderghast knitting. Miss Prenderghast tells Elizabeth to serve lunch, but Elizabeth says she will not do so until Jean comes.
The men discuss Miss Prenderghast, noting that she is a cold, unemotional woman. The Cur thinks to himself that English ladies have no temptations, which is why they are Protestants. The doctor reflects that they will have trouble with Jean sooner or later, as he has his father's blood in him.
Miss Prenderghast tells the men that it was kind of them to come, and they exchange pleasantries about the walk from St. Jouin. Miss Prenderghast then comments on the scarcity of wild flowers in the area.
