SCENE:
XII

Voices in the Night


During the night, Roy tossed about restlessly, and once he sat up,
under the impression that some one had come upon them. He peered
about him and listened intently, but could not place the sound which
had awakened him. Finally, with a grunt of contempt at his own
nervousness, he rolled over and closed his eyes, at once sinking
into a more restful slumber, which lasted until the sun was again
warming the languid world. This time, when he awoke, he sprang to
his feet and threw the blanket from him quickly.

There was a method in this. The insect tribes of the woods find a
blanket, inhabited by a sleeping human, a cosy place to spend the
night, and frequently a camper will discover a strange collection of
crawling things sharing his covering. Thus, having little fondness
for snakes or spiders, Roy tossed the blanket to the ground with
some haste, lest the guest intrude further and stay for breakfast.
He bent over the cloth to see what he had gathered, but found
nothing more than a few beetles and a single, undersized scorpion.
He shook himself well, tossed the blanket on a tree limb to air, and
called the others.

Teddy, arousing himself gradually, to avoid sudden shock, as he
explained with a grin, walked toward the canoe.

Francois, my orange juice, he muttered sleepily, and, reaching
under the seat, pulled forth a can of beans. This was opened with
the aid of a revolver barrel, and the contents were soon being
heated in a pan held over the fire by two green sticks. The four
made a most satisfying breakfast, and, after piling their belongings
once more into the craft, set off again down the river.

Hear anything last night? Roy, who, together with Teddy, was
paddling, asked casually.

Not me, Teddy answered forcibly, if not grammatically. This baby
slept like the well known rock. Why?

Oh, nothing--only I thought I did. I woke up with a start, some
time in the night, and sat up. But I may have been dreaming. Anyway,
if it was some one sneaking around, he didnt disturb us.

It would have taken a cannon to wake me up, Bug Eye declared,
yawning and dipping his hand into the water. Boy, when I sleeps, I
sleeps, an no mistake. Who did you think it was, Roy, The Pup?

Had no idea, Roy answered. I dropped off again right afterwards.
Pop, do we reach the rapids to-day?

We should, the puncher replied. If nothin happens, I expect to
see Whirlpool River Ranch by night. Then the thing to do is to find
those locoed steers, that Gus--er, I mean that The Pup--chased. By
common consent the subject of Guss disappearance had not been
discussed. It was a painful subject for all of them, since they all
liked the young cowboy. Each hoped sincerely that, somehow, Gus
would some day return and take his place with them once more.

What do you mean, unless something happens? Bug Eye questioned,
more to relieve the uncomfortable silence induced by the mention of
Guss name than anything else. Aint gettin pessimistic or
nothin, are yuh?

Well, yuh cant tell, Pop said philosophically. This river is
treacherous. Ive seen her when it looked like she wouldnt drown a
cat, then it started to rain, an in ten minutes she was bubblin
like a wash-boiler over a furnace--sweepin over the bank, raisin
Cain generally. But I reckon the weatherll stay clear fer a while.
He squinted up at the sky. Yep, we wont get no rain to-day.

Now Ill bet itll pour, Bug Eye jeered. Pop, I hearn you
prophesy before. Yore not so hot. Just before we had that
cloudburst last spring, you said we was in fer a drought.

Scorning a reply to such calumny, the veteran puncher pulled out his
pipe and lit it. Then, puffing contentedly, he watched the shore
line slip by.

Whether the gods of the storm had heard Pops boast and decided to
put him in his place or not, the fact is that it did rain--and rain
hard. Along about three oclock the clouds started to gather, and by
four the first drops fell. Within a few minutes the peaceful scene
was changed to a furious tempest, with wind, lightning, and finally
hail scourging the earth.

As soon as white-caps appeared on the surface of the water the boys
headed for shore, and succeeded in getting their craft to a point of
safety on the bank before the real deluge started.
