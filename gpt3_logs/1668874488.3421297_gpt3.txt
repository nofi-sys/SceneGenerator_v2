SCENE:
XXIX


A DISAPPOINTMENT

DURING the second winter Ruth left the ranch only twice, except for runs
down to Wagon Wheel. Late in January she went to Cheyenne with her boy
to make another appeal to the governor. He was full of genuine homely
kindness to her, and renewed at once his allegiance to Rowan, junior.
With the large hospitality of the West, he urged her to spend the next
few months as their guest, to postpone her return at least until the
snow was out of the hills. But in the matter of a parole he stood firm
against the entreaties of his wife, the touching wistfulness of her
friend, and the tug of desire at his own big heart.

Her other visit was in April to the penitentiary. McCoy was away as a
trusty in charge of a road-building gang near Casper. But it was not her
husband that Ruth had come to see. She wanted to make a plea to the one
man who could help her. She carried an order from Governor McDowell
permitting her to see him.

The hour she had chosen was inauspicious. Falkner, sullen and dogged,
was brought in irons to the office of the warden. His face was badly
swollen and cut. He pretended not to recognize Ruth, but stood, heavy
and lowering, his sunken eyes set defiantly straight before him.

Hes been in solitary for a week, explained the warden. Makes us more
trouble than any two men here. This time he hit a guard over the head
with a shovel.

The prisoner had the baited look of a hunted wild animal.

Im so sorry, breathed Ruth.

It was plain to her at a glance that he was much more of a wild beast
than he had been when she last saw him.

You neednt be sorry for him. He brings it all on himself. The warden
turned curtly to Falkner. This lady wants to talk to you. See you
behave yourself.

But when she was alone with this battered hulk her carefully prepared
arguments all fell away from her. She felt instinctively that they would
have no weight with him. She hesitated, uncertain how to proceed. The
best she could do was to repeat herself.

Im sorry they dont treat you well, Mr. Falkner. Is there anything I
can do for youtobacco or anything like that?

He gave her a sulky sidewise look, but did not answer.

Were all hoping youll get out soon, she went on bravely. They are
talking of getting up a petition for all of you.

She stuck again. His whole attitude was unfriendly and hostile.

IIve come to ask another favour of you. Perhaps you dont know that
I have a little baby now. Im trying to get Rowan out on parole, but the
governor wont do anything unless we bring evidence to show that he did
not kill Mr. Gilroy.

He clung still to his obstinate silence. His eyes were watching her now
steadily. It came to her that her suffering pleased him.

So Ive come to you, Mr. Falkner. You are the only man that can help
me. If youll make a statement that you shot Mr. Gilroy the governor
will give me back my husband. Im asking it for the sake of my little
baby.

A pulse beat fast in her throat. A tremor passed through her body. The
eyes begged him to be merciful.

He laughed, and the sound of his laughter was harsh and cruel.

Id see the whole outfit of you rot first.

Im sure you dont mean that, she said gently. You havent been
treated well here, and naturally you feel hard about it. Anybody would.
But Im sure you want to be fair to your friends.

My friends! he jeered bitterly. Thas a good one. My friends!

Isnt Rowan your friend? You told me yourself that he had stood by you
to the finish, though it almost cost him his own life. If he had lifted
a finger and pointed it at you he and the others would have been given
short terms and you would have been hanged. You said as much to me that
day down at Wagon Wheel. Wont you say as much to the governor now? It
cant hurt you, and it would bring happiness to so many people.

You want me to be the goat, eh?
