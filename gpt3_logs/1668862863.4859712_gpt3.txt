Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Vicky did not stay long at the mine. She did not like the look of the
sky. The wind was rising, too, and the temperature falling. Once she
thought of asking Sorenson to go back to town with her, but she scouted
the idea promptly and dismissed it. It did not agree with her view of
the self-reliance she was cultivating. Incidentally, too, Sorenson was a
lazy, sulky fellow who would resent taking any unnecessary trouble. She
did not want to put herself under an obligation to him.

The wind had sifted a good deal of snow into the tracks she had made on
the way down from the shoulder of the hill. It came now in great
swirling gusts, filling the air with the light surface snow. By the time
she had passed the Dodson properties the wind had risen to a gale, a
biting wintry hurricane that almost lifted her from her feet. A stinging
sleet swept into her face and blinded her. She found it difficult to
make out the way.

Before she reached the foot of the slope below Bald Knob she was very
tired. The wind drifts had filled the path, so that she had to break her
own trail. The fury of the storm was constantly increasing.

In the comparative shelter of a little draw she stopped to decide what
she had better do. It was still a mile and a half to town. She did not
believe she could possibly make it even if she did not lose the way. Nor
could she climb Bald Knob again to the Dodson camp. That would not be
within her power. There was a little cabin in the next draw where Ralph
slept when he did not care to go to town after spending the day on his
Bald Knob property. It was usually stocked with supplies of food and
fuel. No doubt it would be unoccupied now.

She put her head down into the white blizzard and trudged round the edge
of the ridge that divided the two small gulches. Three minutes later she
pushed open the door of the cabin and walked in.

A man sitting at a table jumped to his feet with a startled oath.
Goddamighty, who are you? he demanded.

Vicky was as much taken aback as he. I thought the cabin was empty,
she explained. Im Victoria Lowell, the school teacher at Piodie. Ive
been up to my claim.

The mans look was half a scowl and half a leer. He was a big
round-shouldered ruffian with long hair and tangled, unkempt beard.
There floated in her mind a vague and fugitive recollection of having
seen him before somewhere.

Better dry yoresef, he said ungraciously.

From the fireplace a big twisted pion knot threw out a glow of heat.
The girl took off her coat, shook the snow from the wet skirts, and
moved forward to absorb the warmth.

Her host pushed a chair toward her with his foot.

She sank into it, worn out. Presently the moist skirts began to steam
and the warmth of the fire made her drowsy. She aroused herself to
conversation.

Sorry I had to trouble you. I was fraid I couldnt make it to town.

Hellv a day, he agreed.

On the table were a whisky bottle and a glass. He indicated them with a
sweep of his hand. Have a nip. Warm you up, miss.

No, thanks. Im all right.

Over her stole a delightful lassitude, the reaction from her fight with
the storm. She looked sleepily into the live coals. The howling of the
storm outside was deadened enough to make a sort of lullaby. Her head
began to nod and her eyelids closed. With a start she brought herself
awake again.

Didnt know I was so done up, she murmured.

S all right. Sleep if you want to, miss, the man told her.

Not for an hour or more did she open her eyes again. The table was set
for a meal. A coffeepot was heating on some coals and a black kettle
hung suspended from a crane above the fire.

Come an get it, miss, the man said gruffly when he saw that she was
awake.

Vicky discovered that she was hungry. She drank the coffee he poured out
and ate the stew he ladled from the kettle. He did not eat with her.

If the storm would break Id try to reach town, she said presently.

No chance. You stay here where youre safe, miss.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with Vicky at the mine, thinking about how the weather is getting worse and debating whether or not to ask Sorenson to go back to town with her. She decides against it, not wanting to be obligated to him, and sets off for town.
The wind is blowing harder and the snow is getting deeper, making it difficult for her to see and hard to walk. She takes shelter in a draw to rest and decide what to do, and decides to try to make it to a cabin where Ralph sometimes stays.
When she gets to the cabin, she's surprised to find someone already there - a big, unkempt man who she vaguely recognizes. He's not happy to see her, but she's too tired to care. She warms up by the fire and falls asleep.
When she wakes up, the man has made dinner and she's ravenous. They eat in silence, and afterwards Vicky says she's going to try to make it to town. The man tells her it's not worth it, and she's too tired to argue, so she agrees to stay in the cabin for the night.
