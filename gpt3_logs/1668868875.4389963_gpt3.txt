Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
A friend.

Ah, said the man, whats your friends name? I only ask because I
know La Boca, and it might be a question of putting you ashore either to
the north or to the south.

He will be at the inn, Hi said.

Which inn? the man said.

Is there more than one? Hi asked.

Is your friend an Englishman? Whats his name?

Excuse me, Hi said, but can you get me to La Boca?

Let me see, the man said, did you mention your name and your friends
name?

Jones, Hi said in desperation.

Well, Mr. Jones, the man said, if youll step along with me, Ill see
if that boats gone that was here. Is it your brother that youre going
to see in La Boca?

No.

Oh, I see. Not a brother, only a friend. I dont remember the name of
Jones in La Boca. Whats he doing there?

Hes only just gone there, Hi said.

Oh, a newcomer, like yourself. Well, this is the La Boca boat.

He spoke to the master of the boat, who was putting what is called a
fish in the yard of his sail.

That man will take you to La Boca, the man said. Hes just going to
start. If you had come to me on your way, I could have sent you off in
one of the vegetable boats hours ago. Dont give him more than two
pesetas. By the way, where will you be staying at La Boca, Mr. Jones? If
you or your friend should want any of these earthenware jars, I am in a
position to get them as cheap as anybody. What initial did you say yours
was?

H, Hi said.

And your friends?

R, Hi answered.

Mr. H. and Mr. R. Jones, the man said. Where are you stopping, did
you say? Because I can get you nice rooms in a boarding-house, which
would be cheaper for you than any hotel.

Here the boatman invited Hi into the boat.

Where are you stopping? the man called. Where did you say you were
stopping? I should like to call round in the evening and see you, if
youre not doing anything. They always say that Englishmen ought to
stick together.

Hi was about to answer, but the boom gybed at that instant and knocked
his hat into the well. The boat had shoved off.

Inquisitive beast, Hi thought. I never knew a man ask questions like
that before. I shouldnt wonder if hes a detective put there to stop
passengers leaving the city. If thats the case, Ill very likely be
stopped at La Boca. If that devil telegraphs, I shall very likely be met
at the pier and shadowed. However, for the moment I am off. Thats the
main thing. But Ive wasted simply hours.

His boat passed close beside Giordano. He was bent over his carpentry in
deep attention, putting a whipping over the join.

He doesnt mean to start for another hour, Hi thought. I am glad I
tried to find someone starting sooner.

The master of the boat, Chigo, the boatman, and Luigi, the boy, ran up
their new striped sails, so that the boat leaned down and sheered the
water. Then they brought out bread, onions, wine and water and some
little transparent fish, which were meant to be eaten raw. They invited
Hi to their feast and all breakfasted together. After breakfast, while
the boat was still moving swiftly to the south, Hi amused himself by
looking into the shallow water at the fish and the weeds of all the
colours of the rainbow. Presently something, which seemed like a piece
of the bottom of the bay, blundered up alongside, turned over and
seethed out of the water into a whiteish blunt thing, which had a kind
of cats mouth that clicked. The click missed by at least two feet, as
the thing did not aim very well. It blundered over, rubbed against the
side of the boat with a slow rasping movement and disappeared.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

He eventually gets on the boat, which is headed by the master, Chigo, the boatman, and Luigi, the boy. They all have a breakfast together before Hi is amused by the fish in the water. Something then blunders up alongside the boat, but misses Hi and disappears.
