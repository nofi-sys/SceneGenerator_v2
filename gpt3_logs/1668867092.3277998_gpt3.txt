SCENE:
They will get us yet, Julian, she said; but what you have done is
worth dying for.

Yes! cried my father, I can go to The Butcher with a smile on my lips
after this. He has done what I always wanted to do; but dared not. If I
am a coward I can at least thank God that there sprang from my loins a
brave and fearless man.

You are not a coward! I cried and Mother looked at me and smiled. I
was glad that I said that, then.

You may not understand what Father meant by going to The Butcher; but
it is simple. The manufacture of ammunition is a lost artthat is, the
high powered ammunition that the Kash Guard likes to useand so they
conserve all the vast stores of ammunition that were handed down from
ancient timesmillions upon millions of roundsor they would not be
able to use the rifles that were handed down with the ammunition. They
use this ammunition only in cases of dire necessity, a fact which long
ago placed the firing squad of old in the same class with flying
machines and automobiles. Now they cut our throats when they kill us,
and the man who does it is known as The Butcher.

I walked home with Jim and Mollie and Juana; but more especially Juana.
Again I noticed that strange magnetic force which drew me to her, so
that I kept bumping into her every step or two, and intentionally I
swung my arm that was nearest to her in the hope that my hand might
touch hers, nor was I doomed to disappointment, and at every touch I
thrilled. I could not but notice that Juana made no mention of my
clumsiness, nor did she appear to attempt to prevent our contact; but
yet I was afraid of herafraid that she would notice and afraid that
she would not. I am good with horses and goats and hellhounds; but I am
not much good with girls.

We had talked upon many subjects and I knew her views and beliefs and
she knew mine, so when we parted, and I asked her if she would go with
me on the morrow, which was the first Sunday of the month, she knew what
I meant. She said that she would, and I went home very happy, for I knew
that she and I were going to defy the common enemy side by sidethat
hand in hand we would face the grim reaper for the sake of the greatest
cause on earth.

On the way I overtook Peter Johansen going in the direction of our home.
I could see that he had no mind to meet me and he immediately fell to
explaining lengthily why he was out at night, for the first thing I did
was to ask him what strange business took him abroad so often lately
after the sun had set.

I could see him flush even in the dark.

Why, he exclaimed, this is the first time in months that I have gone
out after supper, and then something about the man made me lose my
temper and I blurted out what was in my heart.

You lie! I cried. You lie, you damned spy!

And then Peter Johansen went white and suddenly whipping a knife from
his clothes he leaped at me, striking wildly for any part of me that the
blade might reach. At first he like to have got me, so unexpected and so
venomous was the attack; but though I was struck twice on the arm and
cut a little, I managed to ward the point from any vital part and in a
moment I had seized his knife wrist. That was the endI just twisted it
a littleI did not mean to twist hardand something snapped inside his
wrist.

Peter let out an awful scream, his knife dropped from his fingers and I
pushed him from me and gave him a good kick as he was leavinga kick
that I think he will remember for some time. Then I picked up his knife
and hurled it as far as I could in the direction of the river, and went
on my way toward homewhistling.

When I entered the house Mother came out of her room and putting her
arms about my neck she clung closely to me.

Dear boy, she murmured, I am so happy, because you are happy. She is
a dear girl and I love her as much as you do.

What is the matter? I asked. What are you talking about?

I heard you whistling, she said, and I knew what it meantgrown men
whistle but once in their lives.

I picked her up in my arms and tossed her to the ceiling.

Oh, Mother, dear! I cried, I wish it were true, and maybe it will be
some dayif I am not too much of a coward; but not yet.

Then why were you whistling? she asked, surprised and a bit skeptical,
too, I imagine.

I whistled, I explained, because I just broke the wrist of a spy and
kicked him across the road.
