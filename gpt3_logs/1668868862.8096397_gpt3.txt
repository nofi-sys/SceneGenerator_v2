Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Medinas Close looked marvellous in that light of nearly dawn, helped out
by dying lamps. Its well of tall, mean, narrow tenements, built on a
slope, about a triangle of grassless earth, needed some murderous
half-light to give it its quality. At the entrance to the Close an
imbecile woman, with the face of a corpse, held her hand for alms. At
the entrance of No. 41, black as the mouth of a cave, two little boys,
who talked through their noses as though their throats were rotted away,
were sharing what they had stolen from the burning. Most of the Medinas
tenants had been picking plums from that same snapdragon. In the well of
the Close were some chairs and other furniture which had been pitched
down and smashed, because they would not readily go through the narrow
doors.

On the third floor, Hi said to himself, the middle room of the three,
if I dont have my throat cut on the way. He went into that black cave,
which stank of rat and mouse; he struck himself a light so that he might
see the stairs, and came at once on a woman and a man clasped at the
stair-foot. He saw the womans eyes, like the eyes in a skull. The man
detached himself from her; he stank of wine, she of musk. You like to
see my sister? he said, thickly to Hi.

No.

Three pesetas.

No.

Two pesetas.

No.

You like to buy a nice watch, very cheap, very good? The woman, who
had caught some glimpse of Hi, said something in a low voice, which made
the man stand aside to let Hi pass to the next floor, where a man was
beating his wife in the intervals of a sermon. The morning light gleamed
a little on to this landing from a room which had no door. Up above was
the third floor, much darker, being lit only with a taper.

Some weeks before this a man had been murdered at the head of the stairs
there. The dwellers of 41, having scruples about the murder, had placed
upon the wall a coloured print of the Virgin, to whom they lit a taper
each night. This taper now showed Hi the three doors of the landing; he
knocked gently on the middle door.

After knocking a second time, he was aware of a tenseness in the room
within, though no one answered. At a third knock, he felt, rather than
heard, other doors in the tenement softly opened, while unseen eyes took
stock of him. Someone inside the room was moving something: putting
something under the bed, he thought. A board dropped with a clatter,
then a chair (so it seemed) was jammed against the door from within,
then a womans cautious voice asked, Who is it?

Seor Rust, Hi said, in a low voice, Seor Rust.

She did not let him in. He heard her moving about inside, with queer
little clicking noises as though she were snapping on some pairs of
stays (which indeed she was).

Seor Rust, he repeated, Seor Rust.

The lamp in the room, which had been turned down, now turned up; the
door opened a little; a short, sharp, elderly dwarf of a woman stared at
him, and motioned him to come in. He went into a hot little lamp-lit
room, where Zeke stood stock still, fumbling with his hat, beside the
bed. The woman bolted the door carefully behind him. She had a skin like
parchment, coloured like old ivory. She looked at him out of sharp,
black, beady eyes which missed nothing. Her head trembled a little; her
long green ear-rings waggled and clicked. She looked like a gimlet about
to pierce. Hi knew, without any telling, that he had come at a ticklish
time, when the two were appraising loot from the burning. His knock had
been mistaken for the knock of the police. Something had been stuffed
under the floor and a mat drawn over the place: Zeke was now standing
on the mat.

The woman asked him in Spanish about his health, adding that for her own
part she asked nothing better from God, since she was ever better after
the rains, which, as it was well known, drew away from the air we
breathe many most pestilential vapours. Hi replied in English that he
was afraid that he came at a very inconvenient time.

Rust, he said, could you take a message for me, and be away, perhaps,
for some days?

Yes, Master Highworth, Zeke said, I daresay.

Starting at once?

Where would it be to, Master Highworth?

Could we speak out of doors somewhere?
