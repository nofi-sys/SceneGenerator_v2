SCENE:
Then do something better, cried old Tom.

I hope to, some day, answered Skelton.

They were sitting in the embrasure of the library window. It was in a
glorious mid-summer, and the trees wore their greenest livery.

The bright pink masses of the crape myrtle trees glowed splendidly,
and at the foot of the large lawn the broad, bright river ran laughing
in the sun. The yellow noonday light fell directly upon Skeltons
face--his olive complexion, his clear-cut features; there was not an
uncertain line in his face. His lean, brown, sinewy hand rested on
the arm of his chair. Old Tom, facing him, was a complete contrast--a
keen-eyed man, for all he was a country squire, his fresh, handsome old
face shining above his ruffled shirt-front and nankeen waistcoat.

Youve got a pretty good array of literary fellows about you, said
old Tom, waving his stick around the library, which not even the July
sun could make bright, but which glowed with the sombre beauty that
seems to dwell in a true library.

Yes, answered Skelton, but I have an old fellow that is worth all
the books to me--Bulstrode; he is a Cambridge man--carried off honours
every year without turning a hair, and was classed as a wonder. But,
you know, when God makes a genius he spoils a man. Thats the way with
Bulstrode. Hes a perfectly worthless dog as far as making a living
and a respectable place in society goes. He is simply a vulgarian
pumped full of knowledge and with the most extraordinary powers of
assimilation. He cant write--he has no gift of expression whatever.
But I can give him ten words on a slip of paper, and in half an hour he
can give me every idea and every reference upon any possible subject
I demand. He is not a bad man; on the contrary, he has a sort of rude
honour and conscience of his own. He refused orders in the English
Church because he knew himself to be unfit. Besides looking after my
books, he is tutor to Lewis Pryor, the son of an old friend and tutor
of mine, the Rev. Thomas Pryor.

Skelton brought all this out in his usual calm, easy, man-of-the-world
manner. At that moment the boy passed across the lawn very close to
the window, where he stopped and whistled to his dog. Never were two
pairs of eyes so alike as Skeltons and this boys. Old Tom, turning
his glance from the boy to Skelton, noticed a strange expression of
fondness in Skeltons eyes as he looked at the boy.

A very fine-looking youngster, said old Tom. What are you going to
do with him?

Educate him, answered Skelton, the indifference of his tone flatly
contradicting the ineffably tender look of his eyes. Bulstrode was
made his guardian by one of those freaks of dying people. Pryor knew
Bulstrode as well as I do, and he also knew that I would do a good part
by the boy; but for some reason, or want of reason, he chose to leave
the boy in Bulstrodes power. However, as Bulstrode is in my power, it
does not greatly matter. The boy has a little property, and I intend
giving him advantages. His father was a university man, and Lewis shall
be too.

I am afraid you will find the county dull after your life abroad,
said old Tom, abruptly quitting the subject of Lewis Pryor.

Not at all. I have felt for some years the necessity of settling down
to work, if I ever expect to do anything. Travelling is a passion
which wears itself out, just as other passions do. I cant understand
a mans expatriating himself forever. It is one of the benefits of a
landed gentry that the soil grasps it. Nothing has such a hold on a man
as land. It is one of the good points of our system. You see, I now
admit that there is something good in our system, which I denied so
vehemently before I was old enough to vote.

Yes, answered Mr. Shapleigh. Land, land, land! Thats the cry of the
Anglo-Saxon all over the world. Thats why it is they are the dominant
people; thats why it is that they cannot exist on terms of equality
with any other race whatever.

True, said Skelton. All races that come in contact with them are
held in bondage of some sort. Rule or ruin is the destiny of the
Anglo-Saxon everywhere.

Skelton had not asked a single question about anybody in the county.
This did not surprise old Tom, who was prepared to tell him a great
deal had Skelton manifested the slightest curiosity. When he rose
to go Skelton very civilly and gracefully thanked him for his care
and guardianship, and made some slight, laughing apology for his own
insubordination.

No thanks at all--no thanks at all are due, answered old Tom
jovially. I rather enjoyed managing such a property, and I flatter
myself it did not decrease in my hands. As for managing you--ha! ha!--I
admit _that_ was a flat failure. So you brought back that black rascal,
Bob Skinny?


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Skelton and old Tom are sitting in the library discussing the latter's guardianship of the former. Skelton is ungrateful and old Tom is angry, but they soon move on to other topics. They discuss the county and Skelton's plans for the future. Skelton is rude and dismissive of old Tom's concerns.
