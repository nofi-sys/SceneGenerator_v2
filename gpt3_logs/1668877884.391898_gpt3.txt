SCENE:
XVI

BUG EYES ARRIVAL


As Nick Looker said, The day that the dance was to be that night
dawned bright an fair.

As manager of the entertainment, Roy had to see to it that the floor
was prepared, the furniture moved, and everything made ready for the
great occasion. Although Gus Tripp, because he had a slight fever,
was forbidden by the doctor to take part in the festivities, he
played the part of critical adviser to the rest of the punchers.
From his bedside, he became a director of manly fashions, with the
success of a Beau Brummel. Ethel overheard him speak to Jim Casey,
who had approached him with a question concerning the wearing of a
diamond stickpin in a green tie:

Well, now, Jim, you gotta to use restraint in yore manner of
dress. Gus declared. The correctly appointed gentleman dont
never wear loud clothes. As George Beaumont Fletcher says, when you
come outer a drawing-room--thats a high-hat name fer picture
gallery--no one ought to be able to tell what you had on. That dont
mean you should go in a bathin suit. It means you should be able to
march in front of a herd of yearlings without stampedin em. Now
let me see that pin, Jim. Put her in the tie. Now--jest stand over a
bit more--by the window. There! Um--no, Im afraid not, Jim. She
dont match. She _clashes_! Yore dress should be like a symfunny
ochestry, Jim. Everythings gotta match. Now if you was to put that
pin in a _red_ tie, instead of a _green_ one, she might do O. K.
Yep--a _red_ tie is what you need! Then come back an let me see how
she looks.

There were few who dared dispute Guss taste in the matter of
clothes, but among these insurgents was Pop Burns. He flatly refused
to listen to Gus.

I aint no dude, Pop proclaimed forcibly. If I cant put on
decent clothes to go to a jamboree without a New Mexican buckeroo
tellin me, Ill dry up an blow away. I suppose if Gus didnt have
a busted arm, hed be puttin on spats an carryin a cane. Huh! I
goes like a man, not like a bloomin fashion dummy!

But for all Pops protests, the preparations went forward with
gusto. Strange to relate, the general store at Eagles was completely
stripped of green ties. To Teddy, this was a mystery until he
happened to hear Norine humming The Wearing of the Green. Then
Teddy nodded his head sagely and grinned.

The first thing Nell and Ethel had thought of after it had been
decided to have the dance was, naturally, their party dresses.
Each girl had brought one evening gown with her, but these were
fifteen miles away at the 8 X 8. Belle it was who solved the
problem.

If Teddy or Roy were to ride over for them, they would probably
crush the dresses flat before they got here, Belle declared. But I
know what we _can_ do--we can telephone Bug Eye to bring them over
in the flivver. Then theyd get here in plenty of time.

The two guests fell in with this idea enthusiastically, and asked
their uncle by phone to have his man drive over with the dresses.
Mr. Ball readily agreed, declaring Bug Eye would have them there by
evening unless he got caught in a cyclone.

By late afternoon, the living room had been made ready for the
dance. Belle, Ethel and Nell had, under the direction of Mrs.
Manley, decorated the apartment in truly festive style. Brightly
colored streamers of silk hung from the ceiling, and Roy or Teddy
did not even guess they were Belles old hair-ribbons tied together.
Flowers were placed in every available spot, chairs were arranged
along the walls, and in one corner a platform of boards was erected
for the orchestra, which was to consist of Nick Looker, with his
mouth-organ, Sing Lung, violinist extraordinary, and Jim Casey,
Maestro of the accordion. Teddys offer to be a trap-drummer, with
tin pans for drums, was declined with thanks.

An hour before supper Nell and Belle Ada were in Belles room,
trying to decide which of Belles light summer dresses she was to
wear. Teddy, Roy, and Ethel were walking in the direction of the
mess-house, to see if the orchestra was prepared to execute the
dance numbers. As the three neared the kitchen, a determined voice
reached their ears. Teddy held up his hand and they listened.

I tell you that aint the proper way! Nick was declaring loudly.
Now watch me, you iggernant punchers.

Teddy, Roy, and Ethel stole nearer and peeped through the door. What
they saw caused Ethel to clap her hand to her mouth to avoid
bursting into laughter.
