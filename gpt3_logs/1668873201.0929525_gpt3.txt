SCENE:
They had been riding many hours, when Nathan said: Look yonder, Lissa,
in our way. If I am not greatly mistaken, your desire to see a wild
Indian is about to be gratified.

Lissa beamed with excitement. A wild Indian! Should she be afraid?

How can you tell at such a distance? I can see nothing but a dark
object, and cannot determine if it be man or beast, she said.

You have not trained your eye to long distances. I can see that it is a
pony and that it has a rider, and the swift, steady gallop, together
with the position of the rider, suggests an Indian; besides, we are in a
locality where we are more likely to meet the noble redman coming
alone upon the prairie than his white brother.

Lissa watched the approach of the stranger with a shade of uneasiness.
The thought of meeting a savage aboriginal, who to her mind was
connected with all sorts of deeds of fiendish cruelty, caused a
fluttering of the heart which Nathans assurances could not wholly
allay.

How, was Nathans salutation to the man as he drew near; and how was
the guttural response of the Indian as he came to an abrupt halt by the
side of the wagon, sitting in statuesque uprightness upon his pony. Not
a muscle of his face moved. His countenance was as stolid and blank as
if cut in stone, and during the time Nathan conversed with him in the
Pawnee dialect he neither smiled nor expressed any feeling or thought in
his face.

Lissa studied this native specimen with much interest while Nathan
detained him. He was clad in gala costume and was going down to attend
an Indian festival at Omaha, he said. His head was bound with a woolen
scarf of red and black, knotted behind with falling ends. Beneath this
his long, straight, black hair fell to his shoulders. Several long
feathers were stuck in this zone, and a plaited lock of hair hung over
it from the crown of his head. His brown face was smeared with little
lines of red paint, seemingly ingrained in his skin, and his ears had
long slits in them, which were literally filled with ear-rings of
different kinds, sticking out in bunchy confusion. A large red blanket
covered his shoulders and one arm. The other was free and cinctured with
numerous bracelets, while his hand grasped the rope which bound the
lower jaw of his pony. He wore deer-skin leggins, fringed and ornamented
profusely, and beaded moccasins.

Around his neck were strings of wampum and other beads, and he carried
the primitive bow and arrows.

I am glad you saw him, said Nathan, for it may be a long time before
you will have opportunity of seeing another Indian so magnificently
dressed. Their every-day costume is much less elaborate. Besides, this
fellow is rich. Those wampum beads around his neck are money and current
coin with them. You noticed it was a long string, wound several times
about his neck. He also had on wampum bracelets. That braided necklace,
made of what looked like dried grass, is a charm, and a valuable
possession. It is made from a rare grass or weed which is found only a
spear in a place, and is very fragrant. He carried the bow and arrows,
instead of gun, to take part in the festival.

Did you ever see him before?

O, yes. His name is We-wan-shee. He is one of Marks scouts. He tells
me they have been having trouble with the Indians stealing from the
post. Squint-eye and Handle-the-bow have been thieving, and the chief
has given them up to the Government for punishment.

What did they steal, asked Lissa.

Horses. They make little account of anything else. They have not been
many years subject to the United States Government, and are quite
primitive in their habits and manners, you will find. Ill take you down
to the reservation as soon as we are settled. You will enjoy them
immensely.

I suppose there is no danger in going among them, she ventured.

O, no, and Nathan laughed. I believe you are trembling now. You are
not afraid of that one Indian, I hope.

Yes, Lissa said meekly, I believe I was. It is lonely on this immense
prairie, with no sign of habitation anywhere, andhe looked ferocious.

Again Nathan laughed.

Youll get used to them when you have them for neighbors.

In the middle of the afternoon they stopped upon the banks of the river
and baited their horses, and rested while partaking of their luncheon
which they had brought with them. They had passed through many small
towns on their way, towns of mushroom growth, and at one of them they
had bought their dinner.
