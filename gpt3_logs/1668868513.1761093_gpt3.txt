What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
I have no idea what you mean.

Well then it is this, to make the green ladies speak.

What! really, does M. dIonis share his mothers credulity?

M. dIonis is very brave, he has given proofs of it; but he believes in
ghosts and fears them. Let the three young ladies forbid us to hasten
the law suit and the suit will remain inactive.

So, you can think of nothing better to satisfy the desire I feel of
aiding you, than that of condemning me to the use of abominable
impostures? Ah! Madame, how well you understand the art of making people
unhappy!

What! you are so scrupulous as all that? Havent you already
participated with a good grace?

A joke without consequences was all very well; but if M. dIonis
inquires into the matter and summons me to declare upon my honor....

True! Tis only another worthless idea! Let us attempt no more to-day.
_La nuit porte conseil._ To-morrow, perhaps, I shall at last be able
to propose something practicable. It is getting late, and I hear the
abb Lamyre who is looking for us.

The abb Lamyre was a charming little man. Although fifty years old, he
was still fresh and good-looking. He was kind, frivolous, witty,
entertaining, full of fun, and in fact, held philosophical opinions,
always agreeing with those whom he conversed with, for the question with
him was not to persuade, but to please. He threw his arms around my
neck, and heaped praises upon me which I esteemed at their proper value,
as coming from one whom I knew lavished them upon everyone, but for
which I was more thankful than usual, on account of the pleasure they
seemed to afford Madame dIonis.

He praised my great talents as a lawyer and poet and forced me to recite
some verses, which appeared to be relished more than they deserved.
Madame dIonis, after having complimented me with an air of emotion and
sincerity, left us together to attend to the cares of her household.

The abb talked of a thousand things that did not interest me. I would
have liked to be alone to indulge in a revery, to recall each word, each
gesture of Madame dIonis; but the abb attached himself to me, and told
me numerous ingenious stories that I consigned to the devil. At last,
the conversation assumed a lively interest for me, when it turned upon
the burning ground of my relations with Madame dIonis.

I know what brings you here, said he, she has already spoken to me
about it. Without knowing the day of your visit, she was expecting you.
Your father does not wish her to ruin herself, and, _parbleu_, he is
very right. But he will not convince her, and you must either quarrel
with her, or let her have her own way. If she believed in the green
ladies, _ la bonne heure_, you might make them speak in her interest,
but unfortunately she has no more faith in them than you or I!

Madame dIonis pretends however that you do believe in them, Monsieur
labb.

I? She told you that? Yes, yes, I know she treats her little friend as
if he were a great coward! Sing the duo with her, I am not afraid of the
green ladies, I do not believe in them; but there is certainly one thing
that alarms me, it is having seen them.

How then do you reconcile such contradictory assertions?

Nothing more simple, either there are ghosts or there are none. I
myself have seen them, and I have paid the penalty for knowing that they
exist. Only I do not consider them malicious, I am not afraid of their
injuring me, I was not born a coward, but I mistrust my brain which is
composed of saltpetre. I know that shadows have no more power over
bodies than bodies have over shadows, since I have held the sleeve of
one of these young ladies without discovering any kind of arm. From that
moment, which I shall never forget; and which has changed all my ideas
about the things of this world and of the next, I have sworn to myself
that never again would I put human weakness to such a test. I am not at
all desirous of losing my reason. So much the worse for me if I have not
sufficient moral strength to coolly and philosophically contemplate what
passes my understanding; but why should I deceive myself? I began by
trifling with myself, and laughingly summoned the ghost. The ghost
appeared._Bonjour!_ Once is enough for me, you wont catch me in it
another time.

One can readily imagine that I was strongly impressed by what I had
heard. The abbs faith was evident. He did not believe that he was the
victim of a mania. Since the emotions he had experienced in _la chambre
aux dames_, he had never again dreamed of them. He added that he was
convinced that they would have done him no kind of harm or injury, had
he possessed sufficient courage to examine them.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========
