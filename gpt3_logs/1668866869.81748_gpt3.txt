Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
And if the Princess should return to Laythe, I asked, would Ko-tah
still become Jemadar then, upon the death of Sagroth?

He would become Jemadar in any event, replied my companion, for had
the Princess not been carried off by the air that runs away, Ko-tah
would have married her, unless she refused, in which event she might
have diedpeople do die, you know.

You feel no loyalty, then, I asked, for your old Jemadar, Sagroth, or
for his daughter, the Princess?

On the contrary, I feel every loyalty toward them, but like many
others, I am afraid of Ko-tah, for he is very powerful and we know that
sooner or later he will become ruler of Laythe. That is why so many of
the high nobles have attached themselves to himit is not through love
of Ko-tah, but through fear that he recruits his ranks.

But the Princess! I exclaimed, would the nobles not rally to her
defense?

What would be the use? he asked. We of Laythe do but exist in the
narrow confines of our prison city. There is no great future to which we
may look forward in this life, but future incarnations may hold for us a
brighter prospect. It is no cruelty, then, to kill those who exist now
under the chaotic reign of anarchy which has reduced Va-nah to a
wilderness.

I partially caught his rather hopeless point of view and realized that
the fellow was not bad or disloyal at heart, but like all his race,
reduced to a state of hopelessness that was the result of ages of
retrogression to which they could see no end.

I can find the way to the mouth of the tunnel where it opens into the
crater, I told him. But how can we reach it unarmed through a city
populated with our enemies who would slay us on sight?

There are never very many people in the chambers or corridors far
removed from the outer terraces, and if we were branded upon the
forehead, as accepted slaves are, and your apparel was not so
noticeable, we might possibly reach the tunnel without weapons.

Yes, I said, my clothes are a handicap. They would immediately call
attention to us; yet, it is worth risking, for I know that I can find my
way back to the crater and I should rather die than remain a slave of
the Kalkars.

The truth of the matter was that I was not prompted so much by
abhorrence of the fate that seemed in store for me, as by a desire to
learn if Nah-ee-lah had escaped. I was constantly haunted by the horrid
fear that her hold upon the rim of the crater had given and that she had
fallen into the abyss below. Gapth had thought that she had escaped, but
I knew that she might have fallen without either of us having seen her,
since the pole up which she had clambered had been fastened a little
beyond the opening of the tunnel, so that, had her hold become loosened,
she would not have fallen directly past the aperture. The more I thought
of it, the more anxious I became to reach Laythe and institute a search
for her.

While we were still discussing our chances of escape, two slaves brought
us food in the shape of raw vegetables and fruit. I scanned them
carefully for weapons, but they had none, a circumstance to which they
may owe their lives. I could have used their garments, had they been
other than slaves, but I had hit upon a bolder plan than this and must
wait patiently for a favorable opportunity to put it into practice.

After eating I became sleepy and was about to stretch out upon the floor
of our prison when my companion, whose name was Moh-goh, told me that
there was a sleeping apartment adjoining the room in which we were, that
had been set apart for us.

The doorway leading to the sleeping chamber was covered by heavy
hangings, and as I parted them and stepped into the adjoining chamber, I
found myself in almost total darkness, the walls and ceiling of this
room not having been treated with the illuminating coating used in the
corridors and apartments which they wished to maintain in a lighted
condition. I later learned that all their sleeping apartments were thus
naturally dark. In one corner of the room was a pile of dried vegetation
which I discovered must answer the purpose of mattress and covering,
should I require any. However, I was not so particular, as I had been
accustomed to only the roughest of fare since I had left my luxurious
stateroom aboard _The Barsoom_. How long I slept I do not know, but I
was awakened by Moh-goh calling me. He was leaning over me, shaking me
by the shoulder.

You are wanted, he whispered. They have come to take us before The
Twentyfour.

Tell them to go to the devil, I said, for I was very sleepy and only
half awake. Of course, he did not know what devil meant, but evidently
he judged from my tone that my reply was disrespectful to the Kalkars.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with two slaves bringing food to the protagonist and his companion in their prison cell. The protagonist, who is unnamed, is a white man from Earth who has been captured by the Kalkars, a race of cruel, barbaric aliens. He and his companion discuss their chances of escape, and the protagonist comes up with a plan to reach the tunnel that leads to the crater where he and his fellow Earthmen are being held captive.
The protagonist falls asleep, and is awakened by his companion, who tells him that they are to be taken before the Kalkar leader, The Twentyfour. The protagonist is uncooperative, but Moh-goh, his companion, manages to get him to go along.
They are led into a large chamber where The Twentyfour and his court are assembled. The protagonist is interrogated about his home world and his purpose in coming to Laythe, the Kalkar planet. He refuses to answer, and is sentenced to death.
The executioner approaches, but before he can carry out the sentence, the Princess, who is revealed to be alive and well, intervenes and begs for the protagonist's life. The Twentyfour agrees to spare him, on the condition that he agrees to be her slave. The protagonist agrees, and is taken to the Princess's chambers.
The Princess tells the protagonist that she needs his help to escape from Laythe, as she is a prisoner herself. The two of them hatch a plan to reach the tunnel and escape.
They are successful in reaching the tunnel, but are pursued by the Kalkars. The Princess is injured, and the protagonist carries her through the tunnel to safety. They are finally free, and the story ends with the two of them planning their next move.
