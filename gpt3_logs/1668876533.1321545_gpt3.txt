SCENE:
Sit down! said Fay. Take up those oars! Ill give you till I count
three. One!

Dutch Gus dropped to the seat and picked up an oar. He outboarded this,
then reached for the other. His broad back and sodden clothes blotted
out the view astern. He swung his body and cursed as the oars missed the
water. He dug the blades too deeply. He made poor progress.

Fay reached and pressed the cold muzzle of the gun against the Germans
purple neck where it showed above the collar.

A little faster, said the cracksman. Try it again. Its only six or
seven miles.

The girl glanced now and then over her shoulder. The fog along the coast
was heavier than any veil. Beneath this fog the sea lifted and dropped
with a long-drawn moan.

An hour passed with the boat making slight headway. Fay shifted the
revolver to his left hand. They were caught in a current which was
bearing them toward the coast faster than the German could ever row. An
island showed through the fog. A ship blared a signal.

Saidee Isaacs rose, stood on the seat, balanced herself against Fays
shoulder, and called. She repeated the call. It was unanswered. An echo
mocked them as a faint cry was thrown backward.

Sit down! commanded Fay. It isnt far, now. See? Thats land! That
isnt fog. Over there!

He pointed the gun toward where a murky mass of vapor was backed by a
deeper shadow.

She glanced over the boats side. The water was yellowfrom mud.

Were nearing shore, she said.

He stared at her. They both were buoyant with the thought of the
cipher-key. It drove away sleep and weariness. Now and then she touched
the hiding place and smiled at him.

Dutch Gus rested on his oars and breathed heavily. Fay clicked the
cocking mechanism of the little revolver. The German did not turn. He
bent forward swiftly and dragged backward. He repeated the motion. The
fear of death had crept through his brain.

An island, mud-shored and barren, lifted out of the sea. It was no
larger than the deck of a ship. Rocks showed where the high-tide had
washed. There was a white line on these rocks.

Starboard, a little, said Fay. No, the other oar! he snapped.
Thats right. Make for the island. Im going to maroon you there.

The German rose as the boat grounded. He turned and stared downward at
the menace of the revolver. It was compelling. The steady finger through
the trigger-guard, the eye that flashed over the sights, meant death,
and quickly.

Get over the bow and wade!

Fay said no more. He crouched by lifting himself partly from the seat.
He watched Dutch Gus leap from the boat and sink to his waist in mud and
water. He turned the gun and handed it to Saidee Isaacs.

Taking the oars, he drove the light craft far off the shore and in the
direction of the mainland. Each time he feathered the blades he saw the
lone figure standing by the rocks. A clenched fist was raised to the
overhanging pall of fog and sea vapor. A horrible curse rolled over the
waters.

Fay turned away and glanced into Saidee Isaacs olive face. She smiled
with her eyes. She pointed over the bow. He nodded and bent his back.
The boat reached an inlet between two high promontories. He guided it
ashore and inboarded the oars with a jerk of his wrists.

She stepped out and seized the painter. Fay sprang over the seats and
assisted her. They stood on a shelving beach which bore the marks of
fisher-boats keels.

Well go up there, he said, pointing to a path which wound around the
sea end of the northern promontory.

She followed him. He turned now and then and assisted her to climb the
rougher spots. They came to a shelf which was directly over the sea.
They stood and gazed out toward the island whereon Dutch Gus was
marooned. It was hidden by the sea mist.

Let me see the package, he said, fastening his glance upon her. Lets
open it and find out what it is. Then, if it is ever lost well know how
to solve the riddle of the dye-cipher. Id rather have it in my head
than where it can be stolen.
