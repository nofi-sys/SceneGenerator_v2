SCENE:
(When Ed McCauley was still a reasonably young officer, there were
many commonplace things that hadn't been done yet. Satellites
circled the earth from west to east and across both poles and with
other assorted orbits. There were artificial satellites in orbit
even around the sun, and every so often somebody put up a new one
for some new purpose. There'd been a landing on the moon--by
robot--and a robot station there spasmodically reported temperatures
and cosmic-ray frequency, and a surprising number of moonquakes.

But even so, many things hadn't yet been done. Man had circled the
earth in capsules, but not yet had any man lifted his own rocketship
from Earth and set himself in orbit. Still less had any man risen
into space as the captain of his ship and brought it back to earth.
Until such a thing was done, it would be absurd to speak of
spaceships. Missiles, yes. Satellites, yes. But a ship had to take
off and land on its own before men could say there is such a thing
as a spaceship.)

Young Major McCauley arrived at Quartermain Base in an Air Transport
ship which stopped briefly to drop him off and toss out a mail sack
which was instantly taken in charge by two side-armed noncoms and
hauled away. Then the Transport ship bellowed vociferously and took
off across the incredibly level pebbly plain, lifted and retracted its
wheels, and soared up into the infinitely blue sky of this part of
the world. It left McCauley standing in a vast emptiness, except for
unimpressive base buildings. He felt singularly lonely.

Nobody paid any attention to him. There was nobody left around. In a
way it was a relief, because McCauley had experienced much too much
attention once upon a time, and he wanted no more of it. He'd done a
job in an Aerobee once, and now he was to try something in an X-21 that
a lot of people would have liked to try in his place. He preferred not
to be reminded of either thing. So quite uncomplainingly he trudged
across the sun-baked flat ground toward the base buildings. All around
there was astounding flatness. The low hills that rose at the far side
of this dry lakebed were conspicuous here, whereas in more rolling
country they'd never be noticed. There was a row of hangars. McCauley
picked one out with his eyes and guessed that the new ship might be
inside it.

He reached the building behind the flagpole and shifted his bag from
one hand to the other. He went in, mopping his forehead as the door
closed behind him and the sharp chill of air conditioning hit him.

He went to report in. The CO wasn't around. He was over in Laurelton,
the town where most of the men went when they got a pass. The OD was
off somewhere. But quarters had been assigned to Major McCauley. The
noncom in charge of the CO's office obligingly got up to show him the
way.

"Any orders for me?" asked McCauley. "I don't suppose I'm supposed to
sit and twiddle my thumbs."

The noncom looked at a file and said there weren't any.

"It doesn't look too lively around here," said McCauley, "I'm supposed
to have an interest in the X-21. Could I take a look at her?"

The noncom did a double take.

"Oh," he said politely. "You're that Major McCauley! I should have
realized it, sir. The X-21, sir, is in the big hangar down that way.
Number seven. If you tell the sentry who you are he'll pass you in,
sir. Of course. Take-off's tomorrow noon, sir, and everything's ready.
But I'd better show you your quarters first, sir."

McCauley blinked. He felt embarrassed, and he felt a distinct sense
of shock. He was embarrassed because he'd had to mention the X-21 and
who he was, as if he were pushing his weight around. The shock was the
take-off for tomorrow. He'd known nothing about it.

He picked up his bag and waited to be shown his quarters. He followed
the noncom down silent halls with specklessly polished floors. He
entered the room assigned to him. It had tan plasterboard walls and an
iron bunk, and Venetian blinds to shut out the desolate outer world. It
was exactly like all other bachelor officers' quarters everywhere in
the world. McCauley should have felt at home. He didn't.

"Just a minute," he said carefully, as the noncom was about to leave.
"You said take-off's tomorrow?"

"Yes, sir," said the noncom. "I believe it was slated for later, sir,
but something came up and I understand that Major Furness--he's the
general's aide, sir, besides being your observer--Major Furness assured
the general that an earlier take-off would be quite all right, so the
ship was checked out yesterday for fueling. The general likes things
done ahead of time, sir. He says that if you do today all the things
you could put off until tomorrow, you can take tomorrow off."

"Major Furness," repeated McCauley, "okayed the earlier take-off time."
