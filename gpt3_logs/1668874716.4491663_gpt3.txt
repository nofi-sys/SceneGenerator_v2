SCENE:
V.


That night there was consternation at the Grange--Harry had not
returned. His horse, which he had left in charge of a man he knew
at the station, was brought back late in the day to Garstone, with
the intelligence that his master had gone by the London train. The
man said he thought it must have been a sudden determination of Mr.
Braithwaites, who had only said, when he left the horse in his care:

I shall be back in five minutes, Tom. Hell keep quiet enough; he
doesnt mind the trains.

Such a freak was not at all an unheard-of thing among the Braithwaites,
and little more was thought of it after Sir Georges return home that
evening, for he looked upon it as an escapade which would end in the
truants return the next day with an empty pocket and the appearance of
having been up all night.

But, when a week passed, and still no tidings were heard of him, and
when, moreover, it came to be known that the late governess of the
Mainwarings had left Beckham by the same train, and, as appeared later,
in the same carriage, then the people of the village and the people in
the town began to chatter, George to swear, and the Vicar of Garstone
to look very grave. Mrs. Mainwaring wrote to the aunt to whose house
Miss Lane had said she was going, and received in answer the news that
the girl had not arrived, but had written, without giving her address,
to say she was in lodgings in London. And Mrs. Mainwaring repented
her abrupt harshness most bitterly, and did not need the reproaches
of her husband, who blamed now his own inaction in allowing the young
girl-governess abrupt dismissal. Joan and Betty ceased their snappish
comments on her, and talked together in whispers about her. And at the
Grange they wondered how Harry was getting on without any money, for
they knew he had only a small sum with him on the day he left Beckham.

Then came a letter from a friend of Sir Georges, saying that Harry had
been seen in Paris, where he seemed to be enjoying himself very much.
And then an event happened which, for the time, turned all thoughts
away from the truant son.

Sir George, who passed most of his time on horseback, was riding home
one afternoon on a horse which had carried him safely through many
a hard days hunting, when, in taking a fence, with a ditch on the
further side, over which they had gone easily time after time together,
the horse slipped on landing, and rolled into the ditch on the top of
his rider. Sir George tried to rise, but found that he was too much
hurt to do so; he called for help, but fainted with pain before any
came. At last a man who was passing with a cart saw him, and brought
others to the spot by his shouts. They carried him home to the Grange,
the doctor was ridden for with all speed, and, before night came, all
Garstone knew that the baronets life was in danger. Day after day he
lingered on, though the hope of his recovery grew slender; hour after
hour he lay conscious, but silent to all. The only person he asked for
was the missing Harry. Every morning he asked the same questions.

Has Harry come back? Has any one heard from him?

And every morning the reply was the same. There were no tidings of him.

At last one evening George entered his fathers room with a face dark
with ill news. Sir George knew that something had happened which
his son scarcely dared to tell him. His eyes brightened with stern
eagerness.

Well, speak out. You have heard news of Harry--bad news?

Yes, bad news.

Is he dead?

No.

Worse?

I--I think so; I am afraid so.

Go on. I am not afraid to hear.

I have just received a letter from Stanmer & Lloyd.

Ah--the sick man drew a sharp breath--the bankers! Well?

They wrote about a check which----

Was forged?

They think so. It was in your name, and for three hundred pounds.

There was a long silence. When Sir George spoke again, his voice was
changed.
