SCENE:
Let me go, she ordered, and her voice shook.

Instantly his mood changed. He thrust his hairy gorilla-like head close
to hers. When I get good an ready, missie. Think you can boss Sam
Dutch, do you? Think Ive forgot how you shot me onct when I took you in
outa the storm? Think I care for yore cry-baby ways? Youll do jest like
I say.

Im going home. Dont you dare stop me. She could not make her
quavering voice quite as confident as she would have liked.

Home. So youre going home? His slow thoughts struck another tangent.
Good enough. Ill trail along an see you get there safe, missie. Like
to say How-dye-do to Colonel McClintock whilst Im there. His teeth
uncovered in a snarl of rage.

Vickys fears for herself fled, swallowed up in the horror of a picture
struck to life by her imagination. She saw Scot lying helpless on his
bed with this ruffian gloating over him. A flash of memory carried her
back to another scene. This time it was Hugh who lay at the ruffians
mercyHugh spent and all but senseless, his muscles paralyzed by the
cold of the blizzard that raged outside.

A week before this Scot had been moved from the hotel to a small private
house put at the familys disposal by friends who were temporarily in
California. He and Mollie would be alone. She dared not lead the killer
to the house. What ought she to do?

The killer now knew what was the first thing he meant to do. He would go
and finish the job he had left undone some weeks earlier.

Home it is, mdear. Hot foot it. I got no time to waste. Where do you
live?

Her thoughts flew. Since he did not know where the house was she could
mark time at least. They were close to a corner. She turned to the
right.

This way, she said, and led him away from the house where Scot was
lying in bed.

He shuffled beside her, still holding fast to her wrist. His presence
was repugnant to her. The touch of his flesh made hers creep.

Youre hurting me. Why dont you let me go? Ill not run away, she
promised.

I know youll notif you dont git a chance, sweetie. His fangs
showed again in an evil grin. If I hurt you some it aint a
circumstance to the way you hurt me onct. I aint aimin to let you play
me no tricks like you done then.

They came to a house, set a little back from the road in a young
orchard. Victoria opened the gate and they walked in. Her brain had
registered an inspiration. Straight to the porch she went.

Dutch warned her. Remember. No tricks, missie. You lead right into the
room where he is an dont say a word. Unerstand?

Yes. Youll promise not to hurt him?

My business. I got an account to settle with both them McClintocks.

At any rate, you wont hurt anybody else in the house, she said
faintly. Youve got to promise that.

Suits me. I aint intendin to run wild.

Swear it, she insisted.

He swore it.

Vicky, still with his hateful fingers about her wrist, opened the door
and walked into the house. At her touch a second door swung. Before
Dutch could recover from the surprise of what he saw, he had moved
forward with the girl into a room.

A man was sitting at a desk writing. He looked up, astonished at this
interruption. The man was Father Marston.

He wants me to take him to Scot, Vicky said simply.

Her explanation sufficed. Dutch, a many times killer, stood before him
with a drawn revolver in his hand.

The minister rose. So you brought him here instead. Well done, Vicky.

The desperado ripped out a violent oath. Make a fool of Sam Dutch, will
you?
