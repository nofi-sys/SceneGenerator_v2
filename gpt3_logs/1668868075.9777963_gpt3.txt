SCENE:
Quite quietly Muckle John thrust a hand into his great-coat pocket.

"Here is my passport," he replied, "and this is my guide.  I am
Captain Strange, on special duty in the west," and he handed over a
document to the man, who read it slowly, and then saluting, stood at
attention until they had passed.

When they were about twenty yards distant, however, Muckle John spoke
in a low voice to Rob.

"Look up the hill," he said, "and tell me if Macaulay is coming down."

But there was no one to be seen, and on learning that, Muckle John
gave a great sigh as though he were vastly relieved.

They neared the tents and were walking on, when an officer rose to
his feet and stopped them.

"Who are you?" he asked, "and what kind of Highland wild-cat is
that?" pointing with the end of his sword at Rob.

"I am Captain Strange," said Muckle John.

"Strange," echoed the man, who seemed a good-humoured fellow, greatly
bored with sitting among the hills.  "Oh yes, I ken ye by name, and I
am Captain Campbell, at your service.  Come and have a crack inside,"
and he made to enter his tent.

With a momentary hesitation Muckle John followed him, but first of
all he took one swift sweeping glance over his shoulder at the
hillside.

Then, seating himself within, he fell into conversation, while Rob
waited outside the tent, watching the soldiers standing at their
posts, or marching up and down amongst the heather.

All the time a curious presentiment of fear grew heavy upon him,
which the silent day only intensified.

"I take it you were at Culloden," said Captain Campbell; "that must
have been a poorlike affair."

"None so poor," said Muckle John; "where there are starving men and
bickering chiefs you don't look for much resistance, but they broke
two lines, sir."

"Did they so?  It is evident the Argyll men were not in prominence."

"No," replied Muckle John drily, "the Campbells were employed in
pulling down walls."

The other eyed him uncertainly.  He felt the sting under his words.

"If the business had been left to the Duke," said he, "there would
have been no call for levies from the Low Country."

"If it had been left to the Duke," replied Muckle John, "every clan
in the north would have made havoc of Argyll."

"You speak strangely, sir--I take it you mean no offence to the Clan
Campbell?"

"I," echoed Muckle John, "what have I against them?  I am a
Lowlander, as my name tells ye; we canna all be born across the
Highland line."

"Well, well, Captain Strange, there are braw men on both sides; I
take it you are on the trail of the rebel leaders?"

"And who else?  But I would as wittingly trap foxes in Badenoch; they
disappear like peat reek on a summer's night."

Captain Campbell nodded his head, and taking out a dispatch from his
pocket, he drew his stool a shade nearer.

"You come at an opportune time," he said, "for here is a dispatch in
which your name appears, and certain secret information is contained
for transmission to you."

"Indeed, sir," said Muckle John, all attention.

"It has reached the knowledge of the Duke of Cumberland that certain
rebels are concealed about the shores of Arkaig, and amongst them
Lord Lovat, who has fled in that direction from Gortuleg House.  Two
days after Culloden, a party of dragoons surrounded the latter place,
but he had gone, carrying his papers with him.  He is an old man, and
should not evade capture long.  The Duke places the utmost importance
on his capture.  If Lovat is taken, he is assured all further trouble
will simmer out.  As long as Lovat lives he will counsel resistance,
and that may mean months of service in the hills."
