SCENE:
XXII
NEW ARRIVALS


The soft and balsam-scented air of summer fluttered the white curtains
of Alice Cramers house as she sat before the open doorway awaiting,
with no little anxiety, the arrival of her fashionable sister-in-law
from San Francisco.

And when her practised eye saw the carriage, a mere speck against the
sky, coming across the prairie, her heart throbbed with the dread of
meeting and she looked about her mean little apartments with a sense of
embarrassment. What had come over her, that she should have lost the
self-possession and ease of manner inherent in her, and become timid and
awkward as the most illiterate of her neighbors?

I have been so long out of the world I am no longer myself, she
murmured, and yetand yet it is not wholly that. I seem to be living in
a state of chronic fear. If only her coming will free me from those
other visitors.

With a choking sensation in her throat, and trembling in her limbs, she
arose as the carriage turned from the highway toward the house. She took
in with a glance the blonde-haired, blue-eyed sister, the curled,
elaborately-dressed child, and then her eyes rested upon the most
beautiful face she had ever seen, it seemed to her. A face so commanding
and bright, so impellingly attractive, she gazed at it in joyous wonder.

Mark lifted them down from the carriage, one by one, and presented them
to her, and the tears started in her eyes as Elinor kissed her fondly,
called her sister Alice, and appeared to overlook the shabby apartments
which had so distressed the housewife a few minutes before.

The little boy bounded and capered in the joy of freedom as he looked at
the boundless prairie, and Tibby Warings eyes glowed with tender
moistness as she feasted upon the beauty of the expanse before her.

Oh, Mrs. Wylie, how lovely it is to breathe freely again, she murmured
as, after removing her wraps with the dust and stain of travel, she
stood, later in the day, outside the cabin door and watched the red sun
touch the prairies distant rim.

Yes, Tibby, you will be a child again with all these country wilds
about you. You will have chickens, cows, and horses to your hearts
content. Mark, do you remember how we youngsters used to go out to
grandpas?

Indeed I do. I remember how you tried to walk a log across Willow brook
and fell in.

And I remember when grandpa whipped you for taking eggs from under his
sitting hen.

Because a little girl about your sizeyou havent grown muchtold me to
do it.

Yes, and I ran and hid in the dry-house and fell asleep there. What a
time they had finding me. And Elinor laughed at the recollection.

Twas old Tige that found you. We never could understand how he opened
the dry-house door, responded Mark.

Ah, those happy, happy days, sighed Elinor. Look yonder, Tibby, what
a lovely group of ponies.

They are coming this way. May I go to meet them, Mr. Cramer? And
Tibby, with Robbie at her heels, swiftly went across the crisp, dry turf
toward the approaching horses.

Is it safe for her, Mark? asked Elinor, looking anxiously after her
protege.

Yes, come on, we will follow them.

How lovely they are, Mr. Cramer. Are they all gentle? May I go near
them? asked Tibby as the twain approached her.

If you are not afraid, select one for your own use, Mark replied.

Tibby went nearer and surveyed them for a moment.

I like that roan the best, though he looks a trifle wicked, she said,
pointing to one a little distance from the herd.

Ah, that is Tempest. He is a little wild. Better choose again.

The horse lifted his ears and struck the ground with his fore-foot
challengingly, as Tibby slowly went toward him. Mark expected to hear
him snort viciously and take to his heels as she neared him, but to his
surprise the horse kept his position.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward, with a third-person omniscient narrator providing objective description of the action and dialogue. There is a bit of authorial commentary on Alice's character and her anxiety about her sister-in-law's visit, but for the most part the focus is on what is happening and what the characters are saying. There is a bit of foreshadowing in the mention of Alice's "other visitors," which may be hinting at some sort of supernatural element to the story.
