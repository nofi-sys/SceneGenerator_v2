Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Then dont be too unkind to me. Promise me that you will send me your
address in town.

I cannot, said the girl; then, glancing round, she saw fixed upon her
glassily the light, colorless eyes of her eldest pupil Joan.

Defiant bitterness and a dozen kindred feelings woke up within the
little governess.

I promise, said she; and she let him take her hand and press it
gently in his.

He turned and saw Joan--saw the malignant look in her eyes, and knew
that she had been watching them. Nothing could have pleased him better.

Ah, Miss Mainwaring, have you too been listening to Lord Ben Nevis
speech? Not a bad speaker, though he gets rather in a tangle with his
quotations sometimes.

Joan would have liked to say something satirical, but nothing occurred
to her. She had even to swallow her indignation so far as to talk quite
amicably to this deceitful Lovelace, and to persuade herself into
thinking that, though he might amuse himself for a few odd moments
with that little Miss Lane, he found a taller, slimmer, less talky
woman more permanently attractive. Still he had certainly been looking
at Miss Lane, as he bent over her, where she sat in a corner of the
tent, in an irritatingly admiring manner.

The truth was, though he scarcely acknowledged it to himself, that he
was really a little in love with Miss Lane. She was not only sweetly
pretty, but good style, the best-dressed woman there, in his opinion,
not even excepting his sister. And he had no intention of losing sight
of her. And why should he? She was already predisposed in his favor;
she had few friends--none who could warn her that he was a dangerous
acquaintance; she was going to live alone a dull life which would make
her hail with gratitude any companionship as pleasant as he felt his
to be to her; he would have many a dull and idle hour in town which
might be pleasantly filled up by the charitable act of taking the
pretty, prim little lady to a theater, or he would not even mind a
picture-gallery, if she proved entertaining enough to reward him for
such waste of his time. It would be pleasant for her, pleasant for him;
and, as she had no friends, it could do her no harm in the eyes of the
world which ignored her. He left the ground, satisfied that he had put
this matter well in train.

She, meanwhile, in spite of one more degree of frost in the manner of
her companions, went back to the Vicarage with them, feeling happier
than she had felt for a long time. The kindly sympathy of this man,
whose handsome face grew so soft when he spoke to her, and who had
been her favorite among the Braithwaite brothers from the first, had
taken her out of the shell of reserve she wore among the torpid natures
around her. As she thought over the event of the day to her, that
low-spoken conversation in the corner of the tent; recalled again each
tone, each look of his; felt again in fancy the warm pressure of his
hand, the question would rise in her mind, Does he love me? And she
fell asleep, scarcely daring to hope, yet half believing that he did.
At the moment when he said good-bye he had contrived to ask her on what
day she was going back to London, and, almost without thinking what
she was doing, she had told him. Would he be there to see her off, she
wondered.

But the little fantastic dream she was indulging was not to last long.
Joan was the person to destroy it. Within a few days of Miss Lanes
departure she asked her mother at tea-time if she had heard that George
Braithwaite was going to be married.

Dear me, no! said Mrs. Mainwaring. Who told you about it, Joan?

I heard it at the Lawsons. It is to some cotton-lady, it appears,
with large feet and a large fortune. I wonder how they will get on
together; they say he never admires any woman of his own rank. But,
then, I suppose he doesnt consider a cotton-lady to be of his own
rank; or perhaps he thinks more of her fortune than her face. I suppose
that is necessary, with such a character for being dissipated as he
has.

Mrs. Mainwaring gave a warning glance from her eldest daughter to her
husband. But the vicar did not mind a little bit of mild scandal--it
amused him; and the reputation of the Braithwaite boys could hardly be
injured by anything Joan might say. So she went on with all she had
heard, and her own comments thereon, every word inflicting a wound, as,
perhaps, she meant it to do upon one of her hearers.

Annie Lane walked back to her cottage that night with heart too sore
for study. So he had been only amusing himself with her, after all, as
she might have known he was doing! She should have known better than to
trust another Braithwaite after Harrys conduct toward her. She felt
utterly humiliated and fierce with indignation against them. She had
been the plaything of both, and the girlish pleasure she had felt in
their admiration and attention had been dearly paid for.
