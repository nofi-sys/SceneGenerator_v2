SCENE:
One would think little Annie were still here reading you sermons
across the table with her pretty eyes, said he.

The blood rushed to the lads face, for Harry uttered an oath at the
mention of his wife.

I wish we had never frightened the dear little thing away, Wilfred
went on, in a maudlin manner. She was our little bit of righteousness.
It made me take to bad courses, her going away did.

This was not a happy speech, and it was followed by a minutes silence
on the part of all three of his brothers; Stephen was not there.

Why dont you hunt her up, Harry? went on Wilfred, who either wished
to irritate his brother or had less tact than usual. I wouldnt let
my wife leave me in the lurch, if I had one, and go tramping about all
over the world, amusing herself without me.

She may go to the deuce for what I care, if she isnt gone already!
burst out Harry.

William clinched his fists and tried to keep still. The injured husband
went on:

A little, sly, vagabond governess, glad enough to entrap a gentleman
into marrying her, and then cutting away and bringing disgrace upon his
name!

Disgrace! cried William, turning with flashing eyes upon his brother.
As if any wife could disgrace you! As if Annie, who was a thousand
times too good for you to black her shoes, could have any worse
disgrace than to be your wife!

You hold your tongue, you young cub! said his brother, doggedly. I
say she didnt deserve a decent husband.

Well, she didnt get one--this from Wilfred.

She didnt deserve a decent husband, and she couldnt be expected to
stay in a respectable house.

What respectable house?--Wilfred again.

Harry went on without noticing the interruptions.

It was natural that her vagrant instincts should get the better of her
again, and she should take the first chance of going off on the tramp.

You infernal liar! shouted William, too much excited to be careful.
She is no more a tramp than you are. And, as for her vagrant
instincts, you stupid ass, they have led her into much better society
than she would ever have got into with you at her heels!

All the others were startled, and William checked himself as he was
going to say more. Harry brought a rough hand down on his shoulder.

So you are in the secret, are you? Come now, out with it; where is
she?

Out of your reach, luckily for her.

Yes, but you are not, unluckily for you! said Harry, thickly, rising
to his feet and standing threateningly over his brother, not heeding
Sir Georges voice crying, Sit down!

Now, then, where is she?

William thrust away his chair and faced his tipsy brother steadily.

I would not help to put her in your power again by telling you where
to find her, even if I knew, if you were to tear me to pieces!

He stepped aside quickly to avoid the lunge Harry made at him, and left
the room.

Bravo, young un! said Wilfred.

The baronet afterward tried gentler and subtler means to find out
Annies hiding-place from the lad; but William kept the secret safely.

Meanwhile, the fugitive wife was preparing for a new experience. She
had, as she had told William, resolved upon leaving London for awhile,
hoping that practice in the country might mature her talent and enable
her at the end of a few months to take a higher position than she could
aspire to at present. She knew very well that, once out of London, it
would be by no means easy to get back; but the feeling that she was
advancing no further, and could not hope to advance further without
more experience, prevailed over every other; and she thought herself
fortunate in getting an engagement, in a traveling company, just about
to start on tour, to play second parts in old comedy. It was not going
to what are considered the best towns in a theatrical sense; but it
was a good company, and Annie had heard that one of the actors of the
theater she had just left would be in it too.
