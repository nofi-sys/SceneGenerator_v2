SCENE:
I cannot thank you enough for coming. I should have been so very dull
here all alone on the first evening of my return, if it had not been
for your charity, said she, with as much vivacity as she could put
into her tone and manner.

It was my duty, you are in my district. May I come again? She
hesitated.

Dont be unkind. Ive been very good, havent I? said he, softly.

I think you had better not come again, Mr. Cooke. It is different in
the country, you know; but here, in town, the least thing is noticed
and talked about.

When do you play in Nathalie?

I think in a fortnight or three weeks.

It will be longer than that. In the meantime, you wont be rehearsing
every day, and on the off-days you will be frightfully dull--or wont
you?

She turned away irresolutely.

Let me come sometimes, and I wont abuse the permission; and she let
him go without a definite answer.

It was quite true that she would be dull and miserable by herself; she
felt that as soon as she heard his footsteps going down-stairs. She
wanted to go to the door, call him back, and tell him to come again
soon; she even crossed the room to do so, but she turned back and sunk
into a chair, ashamed of the impulse, for she knew that there was
danger in his society. She felt that her indignation against him had
faded away, that his presence had soothed her weary, excited mind as
the presence of no other person in the world could have done, and that,
if she saw much more of him, she would inevitably come to depend upon
his companionship as she had done when they were on tour together. It
had been harmless, pleasant intercourse then; but Aubreys words on
that November night had changed all that; and Annie knew she ought
to have summoned courage to tell him that very afternoon what the
nature of the obstacle between them was. But it was so much pleasanter
and even easier to skate over the difficult matter of her sudden
disappearance, and to avoid the scene which the tragedy-manner Aubrey
had assumed when they approached this subject had threatened.

I certainly did not encourage him to come, said she to herself, with
a twinge of conscience. Of course it does not really matter whether
he comes or not, except that Harry would make a silly fuss if he
knew that anybody who was at all young or nice came to see me. But
there is nothing really for him to be jealous about; and, after all,
I cannot shut myself up quite like a nun just because my husband is
ill-tempered.

So, when Aubrey called two days afterward, and had the sense not to
make any allusion to his love-grievances, she was very glad to see him,
and flattered herself with the thought that he understood that there
was no further question of a warmer sentiment than friendship between
them. In this belief she was justified, for Aubrey had decided upon his
line of conduct, and fell into the position of brotherly old friend in
the most natural manner in the world.

After a few visits, during none of which did Aubrey recall, by word
or look, his old love or its disappointment, she fell into her former
perfectly open and unreserved manner with him, and felt unspeakably
grateful to him for the good sense which had restored the old frank
companionship between them. She grew happy again, attributed the change
in her spirits to the prospect of her speedy reappearance on the stage,
and wondered how she could have remained so long away from it. Under
the influence of these brighter feelings she wrote an affectionate
letter to her husband, with a little compunction at not having
responded more warmly to his kindness when she was at the Grange.

Two days later, as Aubrey was leaving her sitting-room, where he had
spent the greater part of the afternoon, after bringing her some books
from Mudies, he met the servant coming up the stairs, followed by
a tall, fair young man. Annies voice had just called out, I shall
expect you then! and Aubrey had scarcely closed the door behind him,
when the servant reached the top stair.

He stood on one side to let them pass, but the fair young man sent the
servant down-stairs by a few words spoken in a low voice, and stood
face to face with Aubrey just outside Miss Langtons door.

These are Miss Langtons apartments, I believe? said the stranger.

Yes, answered Aubrey, deciding, as he looked at the angry face and
impatient movements of the man in front of him, that this was some
bumpkin admirer of the clever young actress, who looked upon him as a
rival.
