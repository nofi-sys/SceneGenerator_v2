Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
In compliance with his request they were soon seated, except Esther,
who, unobserved by all except Donald, slipped quietly out of the room.

Joining hands, the members of the circle sat expectant, their eyes
closed.

We are describing an old-time seance, reader, and may be forgiven the
minuteness of detail, for even with later experiment with psychic forces
it is found there is magic in the mystic circle.

The silence was broken by Russell, who declared there was a disturbing
element in the circle. Some sceptical person repelled the gentle spirits
who desired to communicate.

All eyes were turned upon Mark Cramer, who smiled as he arose and left
them. Then Esther McCleary was missed.

Where is Esther? asked Mrs. McCleary plaintively. Oi declare that
girrl has left the room agin. Oi desire her to sit with us.

And Mark was sent after the run away.

Theyre asking for you, Miss Esther, he said as he saw her shrink into
a dark corner of the adjoining room as he entered it.

O dear! Cant you hide me somewhere? I dont want to go. I shall have
to dance again. Its all so terrible, and I dont believe its right, do
you, Mr. Cramer?

No, Esther; but then my opinion should have little weight against so
many. I sat down in the circle thinking I might be able to help you. I
am really sorry for you, if you are unable to withstand the mesmeric
powers of that rascalfor I believe that is all there is of it. Try, if
you are obliged to sit with them, to keep control of your own _will_.
Put all your soul in opposition to him and dont forget yourself for a
moment. Cant you?

Ill try; oh, Ill try, but Im afraid twill be no use! Ah, theyre
calling me again, and I must go. Come into the room and help me if you
can.

Mark reentered, seating himself in one corner of the room outside the
circle. The Professor made room for Esther beside himself, but she
declined his civility, and passed around to the side of her mother, not
noticing, until too late to retreat, that she had placed herself next to
Donald Bartram. She flushed slightly as she gave him her hand,
humiliated that she should be placed in such a position.

Again silence prevailed for the space of several minutes. Donald glanced
through half-closed eyes about the circle, noting the placid content of
Auntie Dearborn, the grim determination of Solomon Garrett, the
complacent expectancy of Mrs. McCleary, the awed, half-frightened look
of Lissa, the sly, furtive glance which each Pemberton twin cast
frequently at her sister, and he felt a hysterical inclination to laugh.
The thought must have been communicated to his companion upon the right,
for he felt her fingers tremble in his. He rolled his eyes up to hers
with an affected air of terror. Then a ripple of merriment burst from
Esthers lips, in which he joined. The Pemberton twins giggled in
unison, while all started and opened their eyes.

Russell frowned and demanded quiet, fixing his gray eyes upon Esther.
Mrs. McCleary rebuked her daughter, but explained that Esther was
hystericky, and biting her lips to subdue the nervous inclination to
laugh, Esther closed her eyes and quiet was restored. Donald, thrilled
by her trembling fingers, dared not again look toward her, and presently
he saw Mrs. Jenkinson, his neighbor on the left, begin to jerk
spasmodically. Her eyelids quivered, she sighed a few times, then
drawing her hands from those who clasped them she began rubbing them
briskly together, then slapped them energetically for a moment, while
every eye was fixed upon her. She was under control.

Suddenly she began to speak in a high, shrill voice.

My friends, I have a message for you to-night, and continuing without
hesitancy she delivered a somewhat tedious harangue to the listening
believers, who sat awed and open-eyed, as if her words were really from
the world beyond. All present knew Mrs. Jenkinson to be illiterate and
only able to use provincialism in conversation. They marvelled at the
correct English which fell from her lips, even though the thought
expressed was of little value.

Her inspired speech ended, Mrs. Jenkinson sank into a chair, dropped
her face in her hands and remained quiet.

A few moments later Mrs. McCleary began to manifest similar signs of
influence, and sang in a sweet, plaintive voice the old hymn, Oh, sing
to me of heaven, when I am called to die! Sing songs of holy ecstasy to
waft me to the sky, etc.

Mark remembered that Mrs. McCleary was not a singer in her natural
state, and again was forced to marvel at this exhibition of power which
he had no faith to believe emanated from the source prescribed by
Russell.
