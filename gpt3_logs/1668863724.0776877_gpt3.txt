What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
I wish I could believe that you came here only to see me, she said
at last. But I dont. I am sure you had some other intention, or you
would have been at work long ago. You see, I know what a faithful
workman my little Jean is.

I want only to see you, and if I work it is only for you, muttered
Jean. And if----

No, that little box on the right, said Madame coolly. Torialli
looked all over Paris for it. You see, I wanted it to match the
rest. You have no idea how difficult it is to get a perfect match in
mother-of-pearl. Well! what were you saying? Oh yes! you work only for
me--that is charming of you, my dear boy. And now I think youve worked
on that finger long enough! Not even a genius like you can climb past
perfection. Then there is nothing you want to ask me?

If I dared, said Jean, suddenly crushing the hand he held.

No! dont spoil your work! said Madame quickly. Jean pulled himself
together. He dragged Margots name into his mind and held it there.

Yes, yes, he said; there is something about a poor girl in trouble.
I want your help, Gabrielle.

Again she let her Christian name pass; he hardly dared to believe it,
but perhaps she had not heard.

Ah! I am glad you came to me, said Madame. Tell me about her, Jean!
its not the dear funny little person whos to marry the grocer, is
it? I rather hope it is, you know. I should always love her for having
nursed you when you were ill.

Yes, Madame, it is my friend--it is Margot Selba, said Jean, thinking
how differently in her tolerant sweetness Gabrielle spoke of little
Margot from foolish Margots vindictive unreasoning bitterness about
Madame!

Margot Selba! said Gabrielle slowly. Surely I must have seen her!
isnt that the little brown-eyed one I discovered singing in Louis
room? Yes, I am sure it must be--her eyes were so frightened, and I
remember thinking that brown eyes always show terror so easily. Now,
I have never seen blue eyes frightened. And Madame opened her own a
little wider. Jean looked so long at them that Madame had to move her
hand to draw his attention back to his work. What about this little
person? she asked.

She is in most terrible distress, said Jean. She works for her
mother and herself. I want you to help me about the account; its a
very large one, and she cant pay it. Shes asked for a months grace,
and if she doesnt get it shell be turned out into the streets of
Paris; and, Madame, it seems to me for the lessons she has received
from Flaubert altogether too large a sum!

Oh, my dear boy, how terrible! cried Gabrielle quickly. It seems to
me that all girls with voices have to support a mother! I have heard,
ah! so many such sad tales, and you believe it all, of course!

These are my friends--I know that it is true, said Jean, simply.

Gabrielle shivered a little.

Ah! how hard life is! she murmured. We sometimes ask God why? But
there is never any answer.

I knew--I knew that youd feel like that, said Jean. I should have
come to you before, there is no one like you in the world for courage
and kindness. Youre--youre so beautiful, Gabrielle!

This time he knew that she had heard him.

Hush! Hush, my child! she said gently. We must think, mustnt we?
Do you know, years ago when I was first married Toriallis pupils came
to me very often--oh, with such tragic stories! How I cried over
them, and I would go to him and tease him to alter the accounts, and
he was too good to me--dear old Torialli--he always altered them, and
he worked so hard. And then one day he was ill; I shall never forget
it. He said to me Little one, I must go on working as hard as I can,
because you see my work is cheap. And Jean, it was I who had made it
so by my foolish womans sympathy. I had made my husbands work cheap!
I promised him then, and I have always kept it, never to interfere with
his business again.

But she isnt Toriallis pupil, you know; shes Flauberts, Jean
explained. And its only that I do not feel the account to be fair!--I
have said I think it is too much. If it is necessary to pay it--I will
try to do so, but it seems to me that Flaubert has asked more than he
has earned!

Gabrielle pressed his hand.
