Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Though he became a man later, he was a child of three when I
first knew him, and I was a youngster of ten. He was fair-haired,
pink-cheeked, and somewhat girlish--that is, a sweet-faced child, who
attracted affection and attention. He had a father, mother, a couple
of aunts--all in the same household, and several devoted cousins and
neighbors, of various ages, who occasionally visited him. I was in the
latter class, and, one day, after running an errand for his mother, I
picked him up, after the manner of my elders, and petted him. He stood
it tranquilly and smilingly, until his eyes rested on a corner of the
room. Then they dilated in terror, and a piercing scream came from his
lips. It was not the ordinary scream of nervous children--it was more.
After the beginning it rose an octave higher, much as a policeman's
whistle will rise from pressure of breath, or a steam siren take a new
note when it is well at work. It was penetrating and harrowing, and
his feminine relatives responded with inquiries and fumbling after
possible pins. Yet the screams continued, while his eyes were fixed in
indescribable intensity on the corner. He saw something there.

"What is it, boy?" I asked. "What do you see?"

"There!" he gasped, pointing. "Don't let it. Don't."

I gave him to his mother, and with the true intuition of a harum-scarum
boy, I ran to the corner, shouting, "Get out of here," at the same time
dealing a furious kick at an imaginary creature.

However, I was not affected at the time. Repeating my injunctions to
get out, I kicked and pursued the imaginary thing out through the door,
and returned, smiling, to the child.

"It's gone," he whimpered. "Don't let it come back."

"But what was it?" they asked. "What did you think you saw, Freddie?"

He did not answer, and I ventured a suggestion: "Ghosts?"

He shook his head. Perhaps he had no formulated speculations of ghosts.

"Goblins?" He still looked doubtful, and I went into detail.

"Horns?" I asked.

He nodded, and shook convulsively.

"Big mouth, with teeth?"

"Yes, and hair--long hair. And dirty, oh, so dirty."

"Did it have hands, or were they all feet?" I asked, enjoying the joke
immensely; for in my babyhood I had felt these fears and seen these
things.

"Claws," he answered, "like the cat, only bigger, and all bluggy--all
bluggy."

"Tell us more, Freddie," I went on. "I couldn't see him very well, in
that dark corner."

"He looked at me," answered Freddie, shivering in his mother's arms,
"and he opened his eyes, until they were all white, and he opened his
mouth, until it was all teeth. And he wanted to bite me. I knew he
wanted to bite me."

"Did he have horns, Freddie?" I persisted.

"Yes--horns on his head, and wings--dirty wings, with claws. But when
you kicked him, he looked at you and wanted to bite you; but you made
him run. He backed out the door. Didn't you see?"

"Oh, see," I answered bravely, though my heart was beating rather fast,
and my tongue somewhat dry against the roof of my mouth. "Don't ever
be afraid while I'm around, Freddie. I'll take care of you."

Then his mother took me by the ear, led me out, and banished me, saying
that if I taught her little boy any such nonsense I must stay away.

That night, in my darkened bedroom, I saw things myself--things with
claws, and horns, and wings, and eyes. But as I had seen them since
my earliest remembrance, and had only drawn upon my experiences in
my suggestions to Freddie, I managed to banish them and go to sleep,
not knowing then that Freddie, my pet playmate, had gathered up these
primordial memories from me, and delivered them back. Later on I
understood.

My banishment was thorough, and enforced to the limit. I saw little of
Freddie through the years of boyhood, only hearing at times that he was
a model boy, an example of good behavior to his fellow schoolmates,
and a reproach to me, a black sheep of a family in which were no ewes
or lambs. My father was a policeman, my two brothers firemen, and my
mother a woman of such soul and character that she could master the
four of us. She thrashed me through high school, but I evaded the
ministry, for which she was preparing me, by running away to sea at the
age of eighteen.
