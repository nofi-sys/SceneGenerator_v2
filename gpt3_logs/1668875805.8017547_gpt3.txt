SCENE:
Ees thees the honorable Meester Topham? she asked in a high harsh
voice.

Topham nodded. Yes! he said, briefly. You look for me, eh? he
questioned, inanely.

He-e-e-sh! The girl giggled. It struck Topham that there was
something artificial about that giggle. It sounded stagy. Besides there
was nothing for the girl to laugh at--unless it were himself. He moved
uncomfortably.

The honorable meester want to see honorable lady?

Ah! Topham drew in his breath sharply. So this was it!

Yes! Yes! he answered, eagerly. You come from her? Where is she?

You love--honorable lady? squeaked the girl.

Topham was past caution now. More than life, he cried. Take me to
her! Quick!

The girl bowed humbly. Honorable gentleman follow, she commanded and
turned away down a white path that led into the depths of the garden.

Topham followed eagerly. All around him the grasses rustled in the
night breeze. The crossed branches of the trees rubbed softly against
each other. The scent of the water lilies grew sweeter.

So she brought him to the margin of a tiny lake set in the midst of
turf that sank like velvet beneath his feet. There beside a carved
statue of an unknown god she paused, and he paused, too, waiting for he
knew not what.

Tiny wavelets broke on the white pebbles. The lily pads rocked on them,
rising and sinking, shimmering white in the starlight. Suddenly the
girl stood up, rising for the first time to her full height.

Walter! she cried. Walter! Walter!

Topham did not speak. He could not. But he held out his arms and drew
her to his heart. Elsa! he murmured, after a while, and again, Elsa!
Elsa!

She stirred in his arms. I love you! I love you! she murmured. Ah!
Do you know that I nearly fainted when you faced me there tonight!
Cruel! Cruel! Not to give me warning!

Topham drew her closer. I did not know! he breathed. I did not
know. And yet how could I not know?

Gently the countess freed herself. Sit down, she ordered. Here!
Where I can touch you, but not where I can look into your eyes. I--I
could not trust myself else. Do you know dear, you have wonderful eyes.

Topham laughed. I! Nonsense! You mean that _you_ have!

No! I mean you have. There is enchantment in them, if you like. How
else could a single glance from them across a crowded street bring
me--me--Elsa de Ouro Preto--to your feet. My face burns when I think
how I fell into your arms--and yet I would not have it otherwise. Dios!
Walter! What have you done to me?

Not more than you have done to me--

Hush! There is no time. I shall be missed and then--

Missed. Who--

Now! Now! Now! No one you need trouble your head about. But let me
talk. I am here on a political mission--you must have guessed that.
I cannot let you become involved in it. There are reasons--you will
not ask me for them--but there are good reasons why you must not be
suspected of any association with me or my work.

Tophams eyes grew troubled. Tell me one thing, he begged. Tell me--

No! No! I can tell you nothing. I will not lie to you and I can not
tell you the truth. You may suspect what you please. It is your right.
But you may not ask me anything. It would do no good and might do
much harm. That is why I pretended not to know you in the dining-room
tonight. That is why I have slipped out to you in this guise. I could
not come in any other. It is best that no one should know that you know
me!

May I not meet you? May I not be presented? May I not--

The countesss breath came faster. No! No! she gasped. No! No! I
could not bear it. Besides there will be no chance. I leave tomorrow.
