SCENE:
XIX

BACK TO THE BENCH


The coach met Dud at third. He appeared smiling and unworried, but his
characteristic trick of jumbling his words betrayed the fact that he
was not as calm as he looked.

Think you can go in there and pull us out of this mess, Baker? he
asked. Take all the time you want and set your gignals rightI mean
get your rignals sighterwell, go ahead, my boy, and show what you
can do!

Dud made no answer, which was perhaps just as well since had he replied
truthfully to the coachs question he would have been forced to say
that he was quite certain that he couldnt do anything of the sort!
Instead, he walked toward the mound with a fair appearance of ease and
in a condition of blue funk. Murtha met him, and although the latter
smiled cheerfully and tried his best to look as if he thought all his
troubles were now past, it wasnt difficult for Dud to perceive that
the captain was a bit disappointed in Mr. Sargents selection. He would
have much preferred Nate Leddy, but he had a good deal of confidence
in the coachs judgment and, after all, young Baker had shown real
pitching more than once.

Good boy, Baker, he said cheerfully. Lets see what you can do now.
Listen, let Gordon do the head-work, see? Just try to give him what he
wants. Theyve got three on and no one out, Baker, and the scores two
against you. Whatever you do, old man, dont pass him. Let him hit if
you have to and try to make him pop up. Do your best, Baker, for we
want this game!

Guy handed him the ball and Dud, very trembly at the knees, conscious
of the hot glare of sunlight that made heat waves dance along the
paths, conscious of the encouraging voices of teammates and of hearty
applause from the stand, wrapped his fingers about the leather and
sent in his first warming-up ball. A whoop of joy and derision came
from the visitors bench, for the ball had almost eluded the spry
Gordon. Back it came and Dud, trying his best to calm his nerves, shot
it in again. It was all right that time and the next. Then the ball
struck the ground in front of the plate and Gordon had to drop and
block it. One more, high and wide, ended the practice and the Lawrence
third-baseman stepped up to the plate again as the umpire called
Play! From the Lawrence bench and from the Lawrence coachers came a
sudden hubbub of sound, but through it Dud heard Nick Blakes cheerful
voice.

Were all with you, Dud! Go to it, son!

Dud! Nick had never called him that before, and somehow the thought
steadied him remarkably. To be sure, his knees were still a trifle
wobbly as he studied Gordons fingers laid against the back of his
mitt, but the stage-fright was passing.

Lets get him, Baker, called Gordon as he arose from his crouch and
held hands wide apart. Youve got the stuff, old man!

With a man on third watching for the least excuse to race home, a full
wind-up was out of the question, and Dud realized that he must depend
more on cunning than speed. Gordon had shown three fingers horizontal,
and three fingers horizontal called for a low curve ball. Dud,
emulating the example of Myatt, surveyed the bases slowly, pulled his
cap down, tried to shut out the wild cries of the coachers, snuggled
the ball in his fingers, threw his arm up, took his stride and pitched.

At the plate the batter moved up on the ball, hesitated and let it pass.

Strike! said the umpire.

There was cheering from the stand, yells of triumph from the players
in the field, but Dud scarcely heard them. Gordon, walking down the
alley, thumped ball and mitt together. Thats the stuff, Baker! he
cried. One-and-two now! Lets have him out! He tossed the ball back,
a watchful eye on third, went back to his place, crouched, signaled and
again held hands wide apart. He wanted a drop and he got it, but it
shaved too closely the outer corner and the umpire judged it a ball.
Gordon turned indignantly.

_What!_

You heard what I said, returned the official crisply.

Gordon grinned and returned the ball. It looked good, Baker! Lets
have it again!

But it was one finger this time, and the fast one that sailed
straight across the plate caught the batsman napping, and the umpires
_Striketwo!_ was drowned in a shout of joy from the Grafton
sympathizers.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with the coach meeting Dud at third base. The coach appears calm, but his jumbled speech betrays his nervousness. He asks Dud if he thinks he can pitch the team to a win, and Dud is too honest to lie, so he says nothing.
Murtha, the team captain, greets Dud and tries to encourage him, but it is clear he is not thrilled with the coach's decision to put Dud in the game. He tells Dud to let the catcher call the pitches and just focus on getting the batter out.
Dud begins warming up and the Lawrence team's bench starts jeering him. Nick Blake, one of Dud's teammates, calls out to him and tells him the team is behind him.
Dud pitches to the first batter and gets him to strike out. The crowd cheers and Dud's confidence begins to grow. He pitches to the second batter and gets him to pop out.
The third batter walks, bringing the tying run to the plate. Dud knows he cannot afford to let the batter get on base, so he throws a fastball down the middle of the plate. The batter swings and misses, strike three, and the Grafton team wins the game.
