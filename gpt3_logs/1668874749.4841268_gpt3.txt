SCENE:
The days which followed between Sir Georges death and the funeral were
an awkward time for Harry and his eldest brother. The younger purposely
held aloof, and avoided any private conversation with the present head
of the family. Only once did George catch him alone, and instantly took
advantage of the opportunity.

Dont go, said he, laying his hand on the arm of his brother, who
was going to leave the stable as he entered it. I have been waiting
for a chance to speak to you. Our father left your future in my hands,
you know, he added, in a tone which, if he chose, the other might take
as a warning.

Well, what is it? asked Harry, impatiently.

Dont be so fidgety. It is nothing unpleasant. I only want to know if
you can tell me where to find the Mainwarings late governess, Miss
Lane?

And you said you had nothing unpleasant to say! I call it
unpleasant--confoundedly unpleasant--to ask me such a question! As if I
had anything to do with Miss Lane! What do you want to know for? His
manner changed from sullen to fierce with this question.

Your manner is a little inconsistent. If you know nothing about her,
why are you so angry when I ask you if you do?

I dont care to be put through my catechism. You ask more questions
than my father did.

Then he spoke to you about this matter?

What if he did?

And you told him the truth?

Yes, the truth. I swear it! But I am not bound to answer your
questions, and I wont. Take your hand off my arm; do you hear?

Only one question. When you have answered it, I wont bother you
again. Do you know where Miss Lane lives?

A light suddenly came into his brothers eyes, and he answered readily:

I havent the least idea where Miss Lane lives; I swear it!

His brother took his hand sharply off his arm and turned away. He
thought it was a lie; but he had no means of extracting the truth. He
was more interested in Miss Lane than the younger guessed, more anxious
for the interview he was about to seek with the prim little girl than
he had ever been before about a meeting with a woman.

He had to keep his impatience in check until the funeral was over; but
on the very day after, the young baronet went up to town and to the
address Mrs. Mansfield had given him.

Is Miss Lane at home? he asked of the servant who opened the door.
Ask if she will see Sir George Braithwaite, he added, as the girl did
not answer.

She left him in the hall while she went up-stairs, and then returned
and asked him to walk up. And in the sitting-room into which he was
shown sat Miss Lane--but not the downcast little creature of Garstone
Vicarage days--a little, smiling fairy in cream-colored muslin, with
a rose at her throat, and a small hand put out in welcome. After the
first greetings, her glance fell on his deep hatband.

My father is dead, said he.

She looked grave and sorry at once, but not so much surprised as if the
fact of his illness had been unknown to her.

You had heard of his accident?

Yes, I saw it in the papers, she answered, blushing, and not looking
at him.

He looked at her searchingly. Who could have told her all about it but
Harry?

Were they all there when he died? she asked, softly.

All the family were there--yes. Didnt you know?

How could I know, Sir George? I have not kept up correspondence with
the Mainwarings. They do not care enough about me.

But you left others behind you at Garstone who did, said he, more
hurriedly than he generally spoke such speeches, for his heart was
beating faster.
