What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
O, as for Esther, I dont think she need yield to his power if she
prefers not to. She can avoid him. Lissa spoke sharply.

Not when her mother compels her to see him. My child, do you really
believe in spiritism yourself?

Why, Nate, what a question for you to ask! I am sure you are the one
who gave the most credence to it when I first knew you. I didnt take
any stock in it then.

And now?

And now I think theres something in it which cannot be accounted for
in any other way, andI think it is a blessed thought that our friends
are near us after death.

I dont know whether it is or not. It cant be pleasant for them to be
witnessing all the pain and suffering which we are perhaps bearing. If
we are promised happiness in the other world it would seem a poor
fulfilment of it to me. I could not be happy if I could look back and
see you suffering for food and not be able to provide it.

I was not thinking so much of their happiness, I confess, Nathan,
Lissa murmured. But if I should die, and be happy, wouldnt you like to
feel that I was near you? Wouldnt you like to hear from me?

But how could I be sure of it? I think I should prefer you did not have
to worry over me any more. I was really startled by a remark made by
Major Walden the other day. In the course of conversation I chanced to
allude to Professor Russell in some way, and spoke of his being a
spirit-medium. The Major turned on me with more anger and vehemence than
I have ever before seen in him and said, Bartram, in Gods name have
nothing to do with one of those mediums! Shun him as you would a
rattlesnake that crawls in the grass at your feet, for I tell you his
bite is as deadly, and you never know when he may strike. On no account
give him access to your home and family. As you value your present peace
of mind or your domestic happiness, never let him cross your threshold!
I was a trifle knocked out, but I told him the medium had been and was a
friend of the family and frequent visitor at my house, and that he
appeared to be a respectable and intelligent man. Yes, he replied,
the Devil may wear the garb of a saint, but hes not to be trusted for
all that. I pray you be warned, and shun the fellow in time, as you
would old Clovenhoof himself! I know what Im talking about. I suppose
Walden is prejudiced for some reason, but I cant help wishing Russell
did not come here.

Im sure I cant see what possible harm he can do _here_, Lissa
replied.

But about Alice. She was not looking well to-night, and I am sorry to
have her oppose Mark.

O, of course she feels bad, because Mark has forbidden her to have
Russell at the house when he is not there, and Alice is very set in her
way. It may make trouble between them. I know Mark was angry, for Alice
told me so, and she said he should find she had mind enough to attend to
her own affairs. I expect shed let him come in spite of Mark.

We will hope not, said Nathan gravely. Mark may have wisdom in his
objection to Russell. I wish he did not come _here_.

How absurd you are. _You_ were the one who introduced him to me, who
believed in him and tried to overcome the horror which in infancy I had
imbibed of spiritism. And now, because of Major Waldens prejudice, and
Marks fanaticism, you are ready to turn round and forbid a spiritist
your hospitality.

Well, perhaps I am wrong. I confess I have an unaccountable fear and
distrust of him. I presume Waldens warning has had something to do with
it. I shouldnt blame the man for his belief.

But if the belief takes away all fear of death, why should we not
embrace it? If I should die before you, I want you to teach little Lucy
that her mamma is near and watching over her. Dont you think it might
keep her from wrong-doing if she knew it?

If she knew it? Ah, theres the thing! If we really knew.

But, havent we proof? What human, unassisted, could turn water into
wine as Professor Russell did a few weeks ago?

But havent you heard Marks expos of that? That is simple. Mark can
do the same.

Mark Cramer?

Yes; Marks university training has served him a good turn in this as
in everything else. You know he is a good chemist, and he can prepare
the glasses so that when water is poured into them a pleasant wine is
produced. He claims the Professor does the same. You will not deny that
Mark speaks the truth. We have known him much longer than Professor
Russell,or at least much better,and you know he is the soul of honor.
