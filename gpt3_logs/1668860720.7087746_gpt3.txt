SCENE:
X.

A Consultation.


What do you think of it, Fotheringay? asked Captain Raggett.

I think, sir, that Captain Mayo was right in saying the place is
dangerous for the frigate. We certainly cannot afford to run any risks
at present.

Captain Raggett had great respect for the opinion of the young
lieutenant and had invited him to the cabin for a consultation on the
situation.

This Mayo seems a shrewd fellow, Fotheringay, and I fancy he already
suspects what I want him for.

Yes, sir, he is shrewd, and I have no doubt whatever that he has
guessed your purpose. But I can assure you that he is a man highly
respected by his neighbors for his integrity and courage and you may
have great difficulty in bending him to your will.

You know the consequences of refusal on his part? Much as I dislike
to do it, I shall have to transfer him to another ship where he will
be obliged to take his chances in the forecastle and whatever rating
on the ships books his commander decides on. You are aware that
this is frequently done with American prisoners and when they show a
spirit of disobedience to their fate they are triced up and flogged.
The Grampus has a rapscallion crew of jailbirds and pressed men, so
Barclay is having daily use for the lash.

Yes, sir, we are lucky in having a picked crew on the Spencer.

Thats so. Mostly all the best men are engaged in the fleets off the
French coast; but I had some influence with the admiral and used it to
get a good crew for my ship. Some of them had served under me before.
They are all right until they get foul of a cask of rum.

Im afraid, sir, if Captain Mayo gets into Barclays hands there will
be hard times for a man of his sturdy Americanism.

Aye, Mayo is of the stiff-necked breed that inhabits this region. And
yet, he is of the purest English blood. I sometimes think these people
must have just cause for their resentment against the mother country,
but it wouldnt do for me to say so openly. I admire the mans pluck,
and it would please me to do him a favor under happier circumstances;
but, my dear Fotheringay, all such kindly thoughts have no place in our
present plans. I have got my orders to proceed vigorously against these
people and Im going to do it.

And we all know that Captain Raggett has never shirked his duty no
matter how distasteful to his personal feelings that duty might be.
But it must be particularly obnoxious in the present case, when he has
to fight men of his own race. In no part of this continent, Captain
Raggett, are the inhabitants of such pure English stock as they are on
Cape Cod.

So I hear, Fotheringay. I am not very well posted in their history,
myself; but, of course, I know that Provincetown was the first harbor
made by the Mayflower and that the population of Cape Cod is largely
descended from the first settlers.

The full story of the early settlers has yet to be written, sir. There
has been little time for such work during the nearly two centuries
that have elapsed since the Mayflowers voyage. Europe has been in a
state of almost constant warfare, and the American colonies of Britain
were engaged in the effort to establish a settled government and to
protect themselves from the savage aborigines. The mother country
was neglectful of her exiled children, her attention being entirely
directed to the protection of her own shores from the assaults of her
foes in Europe. Consequently, much ignorance of conditions in America
prevailed, and it was not until the colonists revolted and won their
independence that Britain realized how much she had lost.

Why, Fotheringay, you talk like a statesman! We never studied such
subjects when I was your age. We were sent to sea when we reached
fourteen and our learning was pretty limited. After that we had to do
the best we could. I regret to say that I neglected my opportunities
and you see the result--I have to depend on youngsters like you for
information on matters with which every officer should be familiar!

If you will permit me to say so, Captain Raggett, I dont think this
lack of historical knowledge on your part has caused England to feel
less pride in the career of the gallant seaman who has kept her flag
flying through many a hard-fought fight.

Thank you, Fotheringay; thank you, my lad. Old Dick Raggett has done
his best for his king and country according to the measure of his
ability, even though some of the young bloods at the Admiralty dont
seem to think hes fit for this blockading service!
