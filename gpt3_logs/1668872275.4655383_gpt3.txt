SCENE:
I was in the middle of an ancient history lesson with my pupil when the
Grand Duke came in. He beckoned to us to sit down and told me not to
stop.

I had been speaking to Duke Joachim of Alexander's successors, from the
fighting of the Epigones in the streets of Babylon to the victory of
Cyropedeon, which established the dynasties of the Lagides and
Seleucides after the downfall of Lysimachus. I had been trying to bring
before the eyes of my young German prince the grand and tragic figures
of Eumenes, chief of the Argyraspides, Polysperschon, Antipates,
Antigone Gonates, and Demetrius Poliorcetes. He listened attentively,
taking notes with a docility which I should have preferred less
abject....

The Grand Duke had sat down, and was also listening. Hypnotized by his
grave, intellectual face, it was really to Frederick-Augustus, not the
dull-witted Joachim, that my words were addressed. He was my audience as
I closed with an attempt to show how the crumbling empires of the
Epigones were to facilitate the victory of centralizing Rome.

As at this point I began to show signs of embarrassment,
Frederick-Augustus broke in, with a smile:

"Don't let my presence embarrass you if you want to establish a parallel
between Rome and Prussia."

It was obviously difficult for me to emphasize, in front of him, the
dependence of the princes of the German Confederation on the King of
Prussia. I did so, however, and he approved.

"God grant that this dependence," he said, "like the dependence of the
powers allied to Rome, may mean the greatness of Germany and the peace
of the world."

I ended by giving my pupil a list of the books bearing on my lesson, and
mentioned that indispensable work, Droysen's "History of Hellenism."

"But excuse me, monsieur," said the Grand Duke, "is there no French work
which can be used instead of Droysen?"

Even at the Sorbonne I had never felt so ashamed to say that there was
not.

Eleven o'clock struck.

"Joachim," said the Grand Duke, "you can go. Please stay, Monsieur
Vignerte."

We were alone.

"Monsieur," he said in his fine but grave, indeed rather melancholy
voice, "you have hitherto had reason to think me sparing of compliments
which you must have considered your due. I have always had the bad habit
of waiting a long time before expressing opinions. The right moment has
now arrived, monsieur. Yesterday, unknown to you, your pupil was
examined by a Professor of Kiel University with little predilection for
French methods. This professor has had to confess himself astonished at
the results you have obtained."

He added, in a tone in which I detected a certain trace of bitterness:

"I know that the harvester deserves all the more praise when he has
obtained his harvest from poor soil. Allow me to address my thanks to
you today, and express the wish that the hospitality of Lautenburg may
be sufficiently attractive to keep you here until you have completed a
task so well begun."

"Your Highness's kindness overwhelms me, sir," I replied, deeply moved.

"No," he broke in emphatically, "it is I who am your debtor. I have just
heard, Monsieur Vignerte, that you devote part of the little leisure
that the education of my son leaves you to a task which is perhaps even
more dear to me. This must, of course, be entirely between ourselves. I
know the difficulties you must have met with before winning the
confidence which I believe the Grand Duchess now extends to you. At
first I did not know you well enough to speak more openly of my desire
that you should be at her disposal, and try to interest her and save her
from the fits of depression and that kind of spiritual disorder which
are so fatal to her physical health. You understood, and have succeeded
better than I could have hoped. You will thus realize that I am indeed
in your debt."

There was so much sorrowful dignity in his voice that I was utterly
overcome.

"Sir," I murmured, "I promise you ..."

He held out his hand.

"I don't need promises, monsieur. I know you now, and am certain that
you will do everything you can to help the Grand Duchess. There is no
better way of justifying my confidence in you. The task will not be
always easy, I fear. A woman, especially when she has been stricken by
the death of a man she loves, does not preserve that balance of mind of
which we men are so proud. Do your best, monsieur." There was silence
for a moment; then he continued: "I should add another form of thanks if
it were not that any further mark of esteem is superfluous after the one
I have given you in speaking as I have done. You must, however, allow me
to offer you some recompense for the additional demands I am making upon
you. I have just given orders that your salary is to be raised to
fifteen thousand marks."
