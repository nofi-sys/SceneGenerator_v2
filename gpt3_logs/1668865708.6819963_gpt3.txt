SCENE:
Bassett spoke up:

Im the person that told them, Aleck. It had to be done. They had to
be acquainted with the whole situation, and they got it from me. But
they heard no lies, no suppositions--you know you can trust me for
that.

Stokes glance shifted to him. Through its savage defiance Bassett
could detect the torment of his soul, despairingly betrayed to the one
person he knew would be just.

Oh, Im not blaming you, he answered: You couldnt do anything
else. And they can hear it all from me. He looked at the two men. I
dont want to keep anything back. You dont have to use any of your
third-degree methods with me. Im willing to tell. I was in love with
her, madly, like a fool, hounded her, dogged her footsteps. Youve
heard that. And my wife was jealous--so jealous they all could see.
Youve heard that too.

The confession of his passion, remorseless in its bitter revelation,
was horrible, like the tearing aside of wrappings from a raw wound.

Yes, weve heard it, muttered Williams.

She hated me. I dont know whether youve heard that too, but Im
telling you and perhaps youll believe what I say if its against
myself. She hated me, and I wouldnt let her alone. My wife was
jealous. Do you see--is it clear? Oh, were in damned bad, my wife and
I, but were not in so bad as youre trying to make out. He jumped to
his feet, the shine of sweat on his forehead.

I dont see, Mr. Stokes, said Rawson quietly, where you get that. We
havent made out anything yet.

Oh, I can see. We were the only people outside the house--thats
enough to build a theory on. And motives--who had a motive? Thats the
way you go to work. Find a motive, fit some one to it. My wife had a
motive, thats sufficient. Dont ask what kind of woman she is, dont
look any further, you have to get some one and shes the easiest.
Christ! he cried, throwing out his arms with a dramatic gesture, it
would make the gods laugh!

Mr. Stokes, if youd take this calmly----

Calmly! Seeing what you think and where youre trying to land us! But
just let me ask you something. He thrust his head forward, the chin
advanced, the eyebrows in arched semicircles rising almost to his hair.
Do you happen to remember there were five hundred people on the island
that afternoon? Any kind of person could have been here on any kind of
errand.

Rawson answered with a slight show of impatience:

Just leave our business to us, Mr. Stokes. Youre here to answer
questions.

Oh, thats plain--questions all pointing one way. But there were other
people on the island besides that crowd--besides us--who might have had
a motive. Isnt anger a motive?

He projected the sentence with a malevolent force, the words enunciated
with an actors incisive diction.

Anger! ejaculated Williams. Where does that come in?

Here, on Gull Island. Oh, weve had more than jealousy. Rage and spite
will go as far. Take your eyes off my wife and me for a moment--look
somewhere else.

Rawsons face showed no surprise, blankly inscrutable, but Williams
wheeled in his chair and turned an expression of startled inquiry on
Bassett. Bassett, in his turn, was staring in astonishment at Stokes.

What are you talking about? he said. Rage and spite--whom do you
mean?

I mean Joe Tracy, was the answer.

Joe Tracy! exclaimed Williams, looking vaguely about in a baffled
searching of memory. Whos he?

Good God, Aleck! Bassett made a step forward: Get a hold on
yourself--think of what youre saying. He wasnt here, hed left the
island before that.

Stokes paid no attention but went on, glaring into Rawsons
expressionless face:

A damned devil of a boy with a record. Ask him, he pointed to
Bassett, ask any of them what kind he was and how he acted here. It
isnt I alone that saw it. Yesterday morning at the rehearsal hed have
struck her if Bassett hadnt interfered. What was the matter--I dont
know. I dont pretend to know everything, but I know rage and hate when
I see them.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish Stokes as a suspect in the murder investigation. The author achieves this by having Stokes confess his passion for the victim and his jealousy of her husband, as well as his anger towards Joe Tracy. This information makes Stokes a more likely suspect in the eyes of the investigators, and it also creates suspense by introducing a new potential suspect in the form of Joe Tracy.
