SCENE:
Schuyler smiled.

As to why I came here, it is easily answered. I was brought here a
prisoner, by a party of Indians and Tories, who camped with me in the
woods at the foot of the hill. Last night a strange apparition entered
our camp, killed or frightened away all the Indians, and released me. I
am trying now to find my way back to Derryfield.

Diana listened to his words with apparent wonder.

A strange apparition! What! is he here again?

I know not to whom you refer, lady, but a creature in the likeness of
a man, but with cloven feet and horns, created such a panic among my
captors as I never saw paralleled.

And still you dare stay here, said the girl, in a tone of wonder.
Oh, sir, if you value your life, let me entreat you to fly. The road
to Derryfield is straight and easy.

And yet _you_ stay here, said the hussar, meaningly. Why should I
fear what you do not?

Oh, sir, that is different. I am--I can not tell you what. But I
entreat you to fly.

Madam, said Schuyler, gravely, I should be glad to do so, for my
duty calls me away. But I have no horse, and the woods are full of
enemies. If I go on foot, the chances are that I never get there.

What then? You can not stay here--you say you saw _him_--what is to be
done? You must go back whence you came.

I can not do it, said Schuyler. The scouts of Burgoynes army are
between me and home. I _must_ get to Derryfield, if I have to steal a
horse.

Diana wrung her hands in agony.

Man, man, I tell you he will kill you if you stay here. You _must_ go
away.

I have a choice of deaths, then, said the hussar, coolly. I am safe
from the Indians, on this mountain, and as for the demon, if he kills
me, he will serve his enemies. On my mission to Derryfield depends the
whole future of a campaign.

As he spoke, the sound of another horn, deep, hoarse and bellowing,
echoed from the top of the hill, and the girl turned deadly pale,
ejaculating:

It is too late! He is here! You are lost!

In spite of his general courage and coolness, an involuntary thrill
of terror gathered over the heart of Adrian Schuyler, as he listened
to the mysterious sounds of the phantom horn. It echoed from hill to
hill in deep reverberations, and when it died away, left him with an
indescribable sense of awe.

At the same moment, as if the mysterious demon had waited to sound
his horn till the aspects of nature were in harmony with diabolical
influences, a sudden shadow swept over the sun, and Adrian, looking
up, beheld a deep thundercloud, hitherto hidden behind the mountains,
swallow up the sun, and rush across the sky with wonderful swiftness,
while a powerful gust of wind shook and bowed the trees on the
mountain-side in a groaning chorus.

He turned to Diana, and behold, she was gone! He just caught a glimpse
of her white deer-skin tunic vanishing in the upper woods on the
mountain-side, whence the sound of the horn had come, and he realized
that it had been a summons.

Man or demon--girl or spirit, muttered Schuyler, as he entered the
woods in pursuit, Ill follow you, and find the mystery of this
mountain, if it costs me my life. Ill _know_ the secret, at least.

He ran through the forest in swift pursuit of the vanishing girl, but
quickly realized that she was far swifter than he, for he soon lost
sight of her entirely, and came to a standstill.

Not for long, however.

The storm that was already brewing became more threatening every
moment, the clouds thicker and thicker, and a few drops began to patter
on the leaves overhead. Remembering the direction of the mountain
clearing, the hussar directed his course thereto, and pushed steadily
through the woods toward it.

He had not far to go to reach it, and ten minutes brought him there,
but the storm had already set in, with rattle and crash of thunder, and
intense gloom, only broken by the vivid flashes of the lightning.
