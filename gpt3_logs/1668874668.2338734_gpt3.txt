SCENE:
My dear Wilfred, what do you know about the man of principle? asked
his eldest brother, with a look which recalled to the sententious one
various occasions on which his morality had given way rather suddenly.
All women are not duchesses; and I would rather see a governess home
on a moonlit evening than a duchess, for the simple reason that I
should get better paid for my trouble.

Not by Miss Lane! cried Harry, starting up, his face aflame.

George did not answer.

Not by Miss Lane! said Harry again, in a louder voice. Answer,
you--conceited liar!

It is of no use to continue the discussion if you only lose your
temper and throw your manners to the winds----

Harrys manners! chuckled Wilfred; but nobody took any notice of him.

Say what you mean then, or by----

I only mean that I should have neglected my opportunities, and put a
cruel slight upon a very pretty girl, if I had not got a kiss when I
wished her good-night.

She would never have spoken to you again if you had done such a thing.
She would have boxed your ears----

She would have done nothing of the kind. Your experience being
confined to barmaids, who very naturally resent your rough overtures
in the free-and-easy manner you describe, you cannot tell how a woman
of more refinement accepts the homage due to her charms when it is
properly offered.

I think this is blackguard talk, said Wilfred; but the time had long
gone past for him to get a hearing.

You think she would have let you kiss her willingly? said Harry, not
so loudly as before, but with his whole frame quivering with restless
excitement.

I dont wish to be boastful, but I think it most likely.

Its a----

Stephen shook his cousins arm.

Let him prove it, Harry; let him prove it.

But Harry shrunk from that. He was as thoughtless and unprincipled as
the rest of them; but he was not _blas_. He was only twenty; and some
instincts of chivalry and respect for the beautiful girl whose name was
being bandied about so freely made him hesitate.

He knows better than to agree to that! sneered George.

Why dont you try to be beforehand with him? suggested Stephen.

I will, by Jove! said Harry, stung and excited past all scruples.
Well see if my rough overtures may not be more to her taste than your
what-do-you-call-it homage. I bet Fire King to a five-pound note Ill
have a kiss from her to-morrow.

Willingly, mind?

Willingly.

Done, then! But how am I to be sure you have won fairly if you come
and claim it?

You will have my word.

There was a general laugh. There are some families, as lawless as the
Braithwaites, in which truth is part of their code, and a lie held to
be beneath a gentleman; but the Braithwaites, while fiercely proud of
their birth, considered that it placed them above obligations, and that
the title gentleman, descended to them from their fathers, was a sort
of inherited, inalienable fortune which required no effort of theirs to
support or to increase.

However, Harry having refused to let the bet hold except on this
condition, it was resolved to trust him, George having fully made up
his mind to supplement his brothers account of the interview by the
evidence of his own eyes.

The next morning, at breakfast time, when the wine was gone out of his
head and his temper was cooler, Harry was a little ashamed of his bet,
for to increase his compunction came the very strongest doubts as to
his power to win it. However, when George asked with a sneer whether
he did not wish the bet were off, his brother answered fiercely that
he never made bets which he did not intend to keep. So George only
shrugged his shoulders, told him he was a fool, and walked off to
the stable-yard, already looking upon his brothers favorite horse,
Fire King, as his own by right, although he did not expect to enter
into possession without a struggle. In spite of his ostentatiously
cynical speeches the night before, his own respect for the demure
girl-governess stood higher than he wished to have it believed, and he
thought it extremely unlikely that his younger brother, who was still
at the stage of being alternately boisterous and shy with women, would
even risk a meeting with Miss Lane.
