SCENE:
You precious little philanthrope! said her husband fondly. It is
difficult to answer you, but suppose there are plenty of associates for
Mrs. Horace Wylie whose characters are above suspicion and need no
vindication. And yet, he continued gravely, the womans face is
vindication for her. Do as you think best. Shall we invite her to attend
the lecture with us to-morrow night?

Yes, if you will. She so seldom goes anywhere, and I am sure she needs
recreation. I could wish it was something besides Dr. Lymans lectures,
however. I am always glad to get home from one of them, and I dream of
ghosts and goblins when I sleep afterwards.

There was a compassionate look on Mr. Wylies face as he turned toward
his wife.

I am surprised, Nell, that you cannot appreciate what I enjoy so much.
Surely, Dr. Lyman is a very interesting speaker.

A good talker, yes, but I do not like his subject, and the little lady
drew herself farther upon the sofa and pursed up her lips defiantly.

And yet the subject is one that may materially affect us?

I do not believe it can _materially_ affect us; if it does spiritually,
why, it may. We shall find out after we leave this world, probably, all
about it. What is the use of believing that the spirits of our friends
can communicate with us. I dont want them to. Its horrid, the whole of
it.

I do not see anything particularly horrid about it. If I should die and
live again in the spiritland and should come back and reveal myself to
your material sight and talk with you as I do now, would you consider it
particularly horrid? That is, he continued with his pleasant drawl,
supposing I come in immaculate broadcloth, shining boots, etc., and
present you with a check for a few thousands to squander in bon-bons.

Oh, do stop talking so dreadfully! I will not think about it.

Then you will not want me to come back? he queried provokingly.
Especially if you are wedded to your second, and well provided for?

YesnoI do not know. I think I should be dreadfully afraid of you if
you did.

Arent you a little afraid of me now? Come, confess. Arent you?

Mrs. Wylie made a grimace.

No, I hope not, but I am afraid of Dr. Lyman.

And why do you fear him? said her husband, laughing as he bent over
and twirled one of her bright curls over his finger. What do you fear
in him?

I am afraid he will mesmerize me and make me think as he does. There
you have my reason for disliking him, and to go to the Lyceum, said
Elinor, flushing slightly.

Again her husband laughed.

Ah, that is it. Do you think there would be any harm in that?

Why, I think it would be dreadful to be hypnotized; to have any one
control your will and make you think and do things you would not do
otherwise.

I have an idea, cried Mr. Wylie; let me try it on you. Come, look me
right in the eyes, relax all your muscles and think of nothing but me.
Mr. Wylie fixed his mischievous dark eyes upon his wife.

She closed her own eyes tightly, and turned her face away.

Never! It would make me forever your slave. I have not much will of my
own now, and you would take that away from me. No, thank you!

As if a woman ever lived who did not have her own sweet will and way.
But, Nellie, you may call upon Mrs. Lucien to-night, and ask her to
accompany us. I shall be curious to know her opinion of the Doctor and
his hobby.

Mne! How kind you are! Mans curiosity again! Well! Ill go just to
gratify you, but she may not be willing to go to such a place even in
your company.

Mr. Wylie smiled indulgently, but made no reply.

Horace, I can almost believe Tibby exercises some such influence over
Robbie. It is really remarkable, the ease with which she can subdue him,
and put him to sleep at any time she desires. Mrs. Harbeck used to fuss
for hours.
