Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
"Well, by-and-by things got better with Harry and me; our claim began
to yield, we got dust and nuggets.  We said nothing to anybody.  We
built a better sort of shanty, and laid out a morsel of garden, we
fished and hunted, and soon learned to live better than we'd done
before, and as we were making a bit of money we were as happy as
sandboys.

"No, we didn't keep away from the hotel--they soon got one up--it
wouldn't have done not to be free and easy.  But we knew exactly what
to do when we did go there.  We could spin our bits o' yarns, and
smoke our pipes, without losing our heads.  Sometimes shindies got up
though, and revolvers were used freely enough, but as a rule it was
pretty quiet."

"Only once, when that Little fellow told you to 'bail up.'"

"What was that, Harry?" asked Archie.

"Nothing much," said Bob shyly.

"He caught him short round the waist, Johnnie, and smashed everything
on the counter with him, then flung him straight and clear through
the doorway.  When he had finished he quietly asked what was to pay,
and Bob was a favourite after that.  I reckon no one ever thought of
challenging him again."

"Where did you keep your gold?"

"We hid it in the earth in the tent.  There was a black fellow came
to look after us every day.  We kept him well in his place, for we
never could trust him; and it was a good thing we did, as I'm going
to tell you.

"We had been, maybe, a year and a half in the gully, and had got
together a gay bit o' swag, when our claim gave out all at once as 't
were--some shift o' the ground or lode.  Had we had machinery we
might have made a round fortune, but there was no use crying about
it.  We quietly determined to make tracks.  We had sent some away to
Brisbane already--that we knew was safe, but we had a good bit more
to take about us.  However, we wouldn't have to walk all the way
back, for though the place was half-deserted, there were horses to be
had, and farther along we'd manage to get drags.

"Two of the worst hats about the place were a man called Vance, and a
kind of broken-down surgeon of the name of Williams.  They lived by
their wits, and the wonder is they hadn't been hanged long ago.

"It was about three nights before we started, and we were coming home
up the gully.  The moon was shining as bright as ever I'd seen it.
The dew was falling too, and we weren't sorry when we got inside.
Our tame dingo came to meet us.  He had been a pup that we found in
the bush and brought up by hand, and a more faithful fellow never
lived.  We lit our fat-lamp and sat down to talk, and a good hour, or
maybe more, went by.  Then we lay down, for there was lots to be done
in the morning.

"There was a little hole in the hut at one end where Wango, as we
called the wild dog, could crawl through; and just as we were dozing
off I heard a slight noise, and opened my eyes enough to see poor
Wango creeping out.  We felt sure he wouldn't go far, and would rush
in and alarm us if there were the slightest danger.  So in a minute
more I was sleeping as soundly as only a miner can sleep, Archie.
How long I may have slept, or how late or early it was, I couldn't
say, but I awoke all at once with a start.  There was a man in the
hut.  Next minute a shot was fired.  I fell back, and don't remember
any more.  Harry there will tell you the rest."

"It was the shot that wakened me, Archie, but I felt stupid.  I
groped round for my revolver, and couldn't find it.  Then, Johnnie, I
just let them have it Tom Sayers's fashion--like I did you in the
wood, if you remember."

"There were two of them?"

"Aye, Vance and the doctor.  I could see their faces by the light of
their firing.  They didn't aim well the first time, Johnnie, so I
settled them.  I threw the doctor over my head.  His nut must have
come against something hard, because it stilled him.  I got the door
opened and had my other man out.  Ha! ha!  It strikes me, Johnnie,
that I must have wanted some exercise, for I never punished a bloke
before as I punished that Vance.  He had no more strength in him than
a bandicoot by the time I was quite done with him, and looked as limp
all over and just as lively as 'alf a pound of London tripe.

"I just went to the bluff-top after that, and coo-eed for help, and
three or four right good friends were with us in as many minutes,
Johnnie.

"We thought Bob was dead, but he soon spoke up and told us he wasn't,
and didn't mean to die.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Bob and Harry are two miners who have been working a claim in a remote area. They have been quite successful, amassing a small fortune in gold dust and nuggets. However, their claim suddenly dries up and they decide to pack up and head back to civilization.
They pack their gold into saddlebags and set off on horseback. A few nights into their journey, they make camp in a small hut. They are soon joined by their faithful dog, Wango.
Bob and Harry are just falling asleep when they are suddenly awoken by the sound of a gunshot. They see a man in the hut and Harry grabs his revolver and starts firing. The man is hit and falls to the ground. Harry then chases the other man, who is also armed, out of the hut.
Harry catches up to the man, who he recognizes as Vance, and starts to beat him. Vance is soon unconscious and Harry returns to the hut to check on Bob.
Bob has been shot in the arm and is bleeding heavily. Harry helps him to bandage the wound and then goes to get help from their neighbors.
A few men come to the hut and Bob is soon taken to the nearest town for medical treatment. He makes a full recovery and the two men are able to return to their claim and continue mining.
