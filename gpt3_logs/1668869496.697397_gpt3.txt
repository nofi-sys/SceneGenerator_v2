SCENE:
First, let me introduce myself. I am now an old man, healthy of body
and mind--else I could not tell this story--but in late middle life was
somewhat feeble-minded. I was an installment collector for a furniture
house.

My earnings were small--just sufficient to afford me a hall room in
a boarding house, where, with my few books, I maintained my interest
in life. I began it as a sailor in deep-water ships, but, because of
the small promise of advancement, quit the sea after ten years, and
worked on shore. I was ambitious, studious, and fairly well educated.
I worked at one thing and another, finally becoming a reader for a
magazine; and, later, editor-in-chief. But the strain upon my mind of
reading, classifying, and rejecting or accepting for publication the
various and multitudinous manuscripts sent to me, wore down my mental
powers until there came an utter collapse, and I spent the next few
years in sanitariums, with all memory of my past blotted out, except
a few salient points, such as the name of my first ship, my first job
on shore, my first incursion into literary work, and the final furious
quarrel with my employer, when I was discharged as incompetent. Then
came my slow recovery to the point where I could obtain and hold my
position as collector. So much, in prelude, for myself and history.

Yet there is one more point of my early life that I remembered, but
only because my memory of it was refreshed occasionally as I fought my
way along in my shore life after leaving the sea--Jack Sullivan, a
watchmate on that first ship, who later became a boarding-house runner
and afterward a successful boarding and shipping master.

Jack's path in life did not coincide with mine, yet we met often during
my struggle for advancement, and each time it was a drink together, and
a reminiscent talk about that voyage; and it continued during the years
when I was an incompetent neurasthenic, and he a prosperous man with
influence at Tammany Hall.

It was after such a meeting with Jack, in which he had paid the bill
and clapped me on the back, bidding me to brace up and look ahead, that
I wandered into a small playhouse, the bills of which advertised a
mesmeric exhibition.

I had never seen such a public performance before, and was extremely
interested, as the operator, a tall, bearded man, in evening clothes,
called up members of the audience and, after a few passes over their
heads and down before them, put them into hypnotic or mesmeric sleep;
and then made them perform absurd and ridiculous feats.

I left the theatre, fully impressed, struck with awe at the power of
one man over others, and boarded a street car on my way home.

Still wondering, and afflicted with an uneasy struggle of my mind with
the idea that I had known of such things before, I was forced to listen
to a desultory conversation between two men who sat near me.

They were well-dressed and well-spoken--educated men--and as the
talk went on I easily deduced that they were physicians, slightly
acquainted--one, a visiting physician of a hospital; the other, a
general practitioner.

"A remarkable case," the former was saying, as I began to listen. "He
has been there longer than any other patient, and there has been
neither improvement nor decline. A complete case of aphasia in some
regards, amnesia in others; for we once succeeded in partly hypnotizing
him and getting incoherent comments--in the choicest of English,
however."

"Is he sane, as regards the present--of passing events?" asked the
general practitioner.

"Sane as you or I, except in the relapses. He has illusions and
hallucinations, but recovers himself without treatment other than
seclusion. It is a case of second personality, no doubt; but there is
no prognosis."

"And you cannot classify it?"

"No, except as double personality. He cannot remember his name before
the time the police brought him to us. He began all over again, and is
now an intelligent man, who reads the papers, and talks sanely."

"Keep up that hypnotic treatment."

"What's the use? We are busy over more modern and vital cases. He is
merely a medical and physical curiosity."

"Keep it up. By hypnotic treatment you can obtain his past and restore
his memory. You know that. Isn't it worth while--to restore a man's
soul to him?"

"Well, perhaps I will; but I am very busy, and he is a hard subject to
hypnotize."
