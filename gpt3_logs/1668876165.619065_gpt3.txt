SCENE:
A passenger from the west, said Fay, using an old countersign.

Clanson growled and closed the door. The last chain was guided from its
channel. The door opened wide. Fay stepped in briskly. He did not look
back of him.

From the west, he said as Clanson locked the door. Ive a scratch or
two I want changed.

Lets see, said the ex-fence, staring at Fay and then at the drippings
from the candle. Its been six, no five years, since you were in here.
Much water has flowed through the Thames since then.

And some blood, said Fay, laying his coat on the top of a dusty
show-case within which was a collection of Japanese and Javanese daggers
with wicked-looking points and yellow ivory handles. Some blood, he
added, turning and reaching in his pocket.

Clanson nodded his gray head. He stared at the front of the shop, then
at Fays hand, which came out with the ten-pound notes Sir Richard had
given to him.

Two and six off the pound, he said craftily.

Then, said Fay, peeling off one half the notes, Ill keep a few!
Funny, too, these happen to be good.

Clanson blinked and counted the sheath. Five, he said, dryly. Thats
makes six pun and five bobsoff. Howll you have it, Edward? Lets see,
wasnt it Edward? You had so many.

Fay watched Clanson and the candle vanish into the gloom of the shop.
Minutes passed wherein he could have obtained a collection of daggers
and jade paper-knives. Clanson was opening his strong-box. The old
rogue, who once said, If there were no receivers there would be no
thieves, evidently thought the Bank of England notes were stolen
property. Fay had no other way in all London to change them. Besides, it
would be possible for the Yard to trail him by the numbers on the notes.

Clanson came back, deposited the candle on the showcase near Fays tweed
coat, and started counting out newly minted sovereigns with fingers that
were loth to see them go.

He finished the count with two one-pound Bank of Ireland notes and a
stack of bright shillings.

Theres forty-three, fifteen, he said. All nice new money. Times was
when you brought me more than that, Edward.

Fay pocketed the coins and bills without counting them. He thrust his
right hand under his coat, wheeled and stepped briskly to the door.

So long! he drawled as Clanson peered out, then turned the key. Oh,
he added as a subtle afterthought, what have you heard of Saidee
Isaacs?

The ex-fence coughed before he answered: Little, lad! A gentleman was
in from the west the other daya fortnight ago, who asked the same
question. Stout gentleman who used to come with you, Edward.
DutchDutch

Dutch Gus! snarled Fay, with his eyes flashing. That rat?

He asked about little Saidee Isaacs. I told him the same as I tell you.
I know nothing. A lady like herwith her motor car and her slavy or two,
dont happen this way often.

Motor car? asked Fay blankly.

The same, lad. Twice I saw it. Once in Cockspur Street, once in
Piccadilly, at Berkeley Street.

Fay fastened upon the old man a glance which flamed white fire. Open
the door! he said, swinging his coat. Let me out! Me rotting in that
hell-on-earth and she in a

Clanson stared after the form of Fay as he darted over the street and
swung westward. Then the ex-fence closed and chained the door.

There is a cab-stand where Regent Street leaves Piccadilly. To this
stand Fay hurried, sprang into a two-wheeler, and said very distinctly
to an ancient driver:

Park Lane!

Ow? asked the driver.

To Park Lane, very quickly.

Certainly, sir, mumbled the driver, climbing up the back and tilting
the shafts to a dangerous angle. Gee-up! he added, cracking the whip.
