SCENE:
Because, didnt he head right for there? And then when we got there
he seemed sort of sorry hed come. He thought I knew too much for
the good of his health. Golly, Ted, when you rode by that grove of
trees I sure held my breath! Froud had his gun stuck hard into my
ribs, and if you had taken it into your head to ride in Id be
strummin a harp right now.

Oh, well, if I had come in, Froud might have beat it off. Cant
tell. Roy, you should have seen that flivver! The top was ripped
completely off. Two tires were flat. The motor was a wreck. It
looked as though it had been struck by lightning.

Wonder what they did all that for? I suppose you didnt find the
dresses Mrs. Ball sent over?

Not a trace. Looked like a spite job to me. Bug Eye said the same.
If he ever catches the gang who held him up, hell spite em!

Did he go back to the 8 X 8?

No; hes asleep in the bunk-house. He wants to have another look
for the thieves, I guess. If his boss thinks its the same gang that
stole his cattle, hell let Bug Eye search all he wants to--and
maybe help him. Ive got a hunch that something is bound to break
soon. The people around these parts are pretty sick and tired of
having those roughnecks play fast and loose with their property.

You said a mouthful! Come on! Lets hit the deck. Weve got plenty
to do.

Think we ought to have another go at the dance tonight?

Not me! Anyway, the evening dresses of Nell and Ethel are lost, and
so they wont be so keen for it. Well just let it slide. Things are
going to be pretty lively here from now on. There wont be much time
for dancing.

Springing from his bed, Roy walked to the bathroom and doused his
head and face with cold water. Teddy did the same, and after
slicking up a bit the two boys made for the yard. Mr. Manley was
standing talking to Nick Looker when Roy and Teddy approached.

Roy, his father called, cmere a second, will you? Want to ask
you some more about that scar-faced friend of yours. Whereabouts in
Harvers Gully did he take you?

Well, theres a grove of quakermasts down on the near side of the
river. If you keep on going, youd come to a small rise, from which
you could see for a good distance on either side. I rode over there
only last fall.

Yore dad said you had an idee the rustlers hang out around there,
Nick stated. That so, Roy?

I dont know whether its so or not, Nick; but thats what I think.
As I told dad, Froud seemed kind of sorry hed brought me to the
gully. Then he ducked as soon as he could without waiting to fight
it out with me, though I winged him in the arm after hed nicked me
here, and Roy pointed to his ear. Hes got to have that arm of his
treated some place, or hell get poisoned. The nearest doctor is
over at Hawley. Say, I think Ill--

Telephone to him to hold a man with a wounded arm? Teddy
interrupted. I thought of that, too. Go ahead, Roy. Myself, I dont
figure much on getting Froud that way. But it wont do any harm to
try.

Mr. Manley said they would wait there while Roy telephoned. When the
boy returned his face bore a disappointed look.

Doc said hed been there early this morning and gone, Roy
declared. We might have had a chance if I had called up sooner.
Well--

The doc couldnt have held him, Mr. Manley broke in. Suppose it
happened to be the wrong man? Doc ud be in a fine fix then. No,
boys, weve got to work this thing out for ourselves. No use foolin
around. The thing to do is to ride that varmint down an snub his
horns so he cant do no more damage. Seems to me hes got a streak
of real meanness in him. Didnt do him no good a-tall to steal that
flivver. He just wanted to act up. Well, his time will come. An
when it does, hes got an awful lot to account for!

Bug Eye made his appearance at six oclock. He had slept off his
wild anger at finding his flivver wantonly wrecked, but still the
indignity of being made to walk all those miles to the X Bar X
smouldered within him. A cowboys legs are not for walking, they are
to keep him steady on a horse.

Upon being told of Roys adventure with Froud, Bug Eye asked Mr.
Manley for a horse to ride after the rustler, but he was persuaded
to calm down and sit tight for a bit.
