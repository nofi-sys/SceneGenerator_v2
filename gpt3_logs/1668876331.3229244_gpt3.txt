SCENE:
The second event of the voyage, in meeting with the deep-sea Greek, had
a different bearing on the quest. Fay realized, as he dropped his head
in his hands, that a pull had come which was strong as desire, and sweet
with freedom. Stavanger, where the sharper was going with his cockney
foil, was a port out of which many ships sailed and steamed. From
Stavanger it would be possible to shake the Yard and the runners of New
Victoria Street. Liberty in every action was possible if he would hasten
to the northern port before the Yard was aware of his dereliction. And
liberty was a tempting morsel to hold before a prisoner on parole.

Fay lifted his eyes and stared at the sheathing of his narrow cabin. The
ship had reached the quay. The passengers were crowded forward where
they expected the gangway to be thrust aboard. Their voices,
cosmopolitan mingled, broke through the silence of the mid-ship
stateroom.

A grating sounded along the boats planks. A shudder passed from fore to
aft. The siren blared three short signals. A call came across the water.
Light, from a mist-hidden sun, illumined the port-hole over Fays bunk.
He glanced at this evidence of day.

Bending suddenly, he reached and lifted the little black bag. The tools
clinked slightly. He inserted a key and glanced at them. They were such
as any doctor of surgery might have carried. There was not a particle of
incriminating evidence in the bag. Fay rose, lifted a towel from a rack,
glanced at its corners to assure himself that there was no marking to
show from whence it came, then swiftly bound and wrapped the instruments
so that they gave forth no sound as he dropped the bag to the
staterooms deck.

He searched through his pockets. The money in his right-hand pocket, the
cigarette case, the automatic revolver on his hip, all were inspected.
Replacing these, he drew out the two envelopes MacKeenon had passed to
him at London Bridge Station.

The first contained one hundred pounds in Bank of England notes. These
were folded lengthwise. They were crinkling new and sweet to the touch.
He pocketed them and tore the edge of the second envelope. Its contents
caused him to furrow his brow.

The note it contained was from Sir Richard. It read:

S. I. informs me, via phone, that D. G. tailed you from her house,
going south. She saw him pass from upper window. Govern yourself
accordingly. Get wise, F., and dont overlook the trifles.

Your Masked Friend.

Fay read the note twice before he laid it in the wash-bowl and touched a
match to its edge. He breathed tensely as he waited for the smoke to
clear from the stateroom. It was all too evident that Sir Richard and
the girl were hand in glove in the cipher matter.

There was that in the note which spoke for itself. Fay felt that it had
been written more for the effect it would have on his loyalty than for
the information it contained. Besides, after all, Dutch Gus had given up
tailing him and had waited until Saidee left the house in her black
motor.

Fay lifted his cap, brushed back his hair, turned on the water and
washed the ashes of the note down through the drain, then seized the
black bag and hurried through the stateroom door. His trail was a clean
one. There was no evidence of his intentions, one way or the other, upon
the North Sea boat.

He worked forward between protesting lines of waiting passengers. He
reached the ladder which led up to the wheel-house and chart-room.
There, grouped against the bay of the smoking-room, he saw the
cardsharpersans glasses and sans his wooden stare. Beyond the Greek,
as a man apart, stood the racy-looking cockney in a great tan coat,
trimmed with coster buttons. Their luggage was also separated. This
final touch was for the benefit of the gulls and pigeons they had
trimmed on the passage over.

Fay swung and stared over the low housetops of the city. Smoke drifted
across the quay and wreathed the deck-staunchions. Heavy guttural voices
echoed from the pile-strewn shore. A curious crowd of Lowlanders stood
on the edge of the dock and stared toward the ship. Among them were dogs
and well-matured children.

All ashore! called the skipper from a ledge before the wheel-house.
Line this way and pass the inspectors. All bags and luggage will be
opened.

Fay pressed back the lapel of his tweed coat and exposed the little
silver greyhound as he stepped upon the gangplank. He felt a pressure on
his back as he worked slowly up the crowded incline. He reached the
funnel of the outleta roped-in bay where stood two Dutch custom
inspectors, their broad faces gleaming with good humor and badinage.
Behind them leaned a man with an old pipe. This pipe turned and dropped
its ashes as Fay pressed forward the insignia by holding out the lapel
of his coat with a steady thumb.
