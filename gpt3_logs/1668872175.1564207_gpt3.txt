Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
An invitation card, handed to me by Ludwig when I returned to my rooms,
intimated that my presence was requested at the dinner to take place at
eight o'clock in the Great Gallery, in honour of His Majesty the King of
Wrtemberg and His Excellency General von Eichhorn. Third table; place
23.

I spent the afternoon in my room, playing with some manuscript or other,
turning over pages, but not reading. At seven o'clock I went out into
the park. Two hours earlier I had heard the last strains of the hunting
horns, distant at first, die out in the ravine of the Melna. It was
there that the hunt, led by the King and the Grand Duchess, had
concluded.

The palace was a blaze of light, and through its lofty windows I could
see the great tables groaning beneath their load of flowers and glass.

Most of the high officials and all the Lautenburg officers had been
invited, and three hundred covers were laid at twelve tables.

I went in between a major of the Dragoons and the wife of a Court
Councillor, and neither of them said a single word to me during the
meal. The band of the 182nd played in the Council Chamber in the
intervals between the courses.

I could not see the Grand Duchess, the King, or the Dukes, as the top
table was completely hidden from me by a forest of flowers.

In the hubbub of toasts and champagne I slipped out, and went through
the Council Chamber to the Great Hall, hoping to get a good view of the
entrance of the royalties. A charming voice drew me from the well of my
reflections:

"Well, Monsieur Vignerte, why so solitary?"

I was alone in the great room with Frulein von Graffenfried.

"What about yourself, Frulein?"

"I? Oh, that's a different matter. The Grand Duchess has asked me to
have a look round before the others come in. The waiters are so stupid.
She is most anxious that the flowers should be well arranged."

I looked around at the tasteful floral display about us. Purple iris
alternated with yellow roses, larger and finer than anything I have ever
seen, before or since.

"These flowers are from her own home," Melusine explained; "iris from
the Volga and roses from Daghestan. She has a waggon-load sent every
month, as she thinks the flowers here very poor. They are beautiful,
aren't they?" she added, with her face buried in a large bunch.

"Not more so than she!" I murmured, not knowing what I said.

Melusine gave me a smiling glance. She was dressed in a gown of ivory
satin under a tunic of tulle embroidered with iridescent pearls. No
jewels, save for a necklace of pink pearls round her smooth throat.

Her whole personality, elegant, languid and perfumed, spoke in that
smile.

"Yes, she is," was all she said.

Then with sudden irony:

"So it was her flowers that suggested herself? I shall tell her."

"I beg of you, Frulein ..."

"No, no! I want you to know her. You must come and see us. We get bored,
you know, seeing no one but little Hagen. He isn't always amusing."

"He is in love with her, I suppose," I said, drawing close up to her.

Melusine laughed.

"He's quite tiresome enough for that."

"And she?"

"Monsieur Vignerte," said Melusine, smiling again. "You go from one
extreme to the other, the depths of modesty to the heights of
indiscretion. Don't you realize that, to say the least, your questions
are not very flattering to me?"

She leaned forward, almost touching me. Her black hair brushed my cheek.

"I think you found me much better-looking this morning before seeing
her, didn't you?" she whispered.

She took my arm with an imperious gesture.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The scene opens with the protagonist, Monsieur Vignerte, receiving an invitation to a dinner party in honor of the King of Wrtemberg and General von Eichhorn. Vignerte spends the afternoon in his room, not reading, and then goes for a walk in the park.
At the dinner party, Vignerte is seated between a major of the Dragoons and the wife of a Court Councillor, neither of whom speak to him. He cannot see the Grand Duchess, the King, or the Dukes from his seat, so he slips out and goes to the Great Hall.
There he meets Melusine von Graffenfried, who is dressing the room with flowers. They talk, and Vignerte confesses that he found her more attractive before he saw the Grand Duchess. Melusine laughs and says she will tell the Grand Duchess.
