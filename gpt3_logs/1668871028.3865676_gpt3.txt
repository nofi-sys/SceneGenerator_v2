SCENE:
XX

_Come all ye sons of Erin an listen to my lay,
An Ill tell the story av the wise man av Galway,
A credit to his country--a credit to his name,
Three provinces a-ringin wid the echoes av his fame._

AN OLD COME-ALL-YE.


THERE were but few at the six oclock service, and these were so
scattered about the church as to create the impression of vacancy.
The priest, glittering in gold-embroidered vestments intoned the mass
at the high altar; the acolytes drowsily made the responses; the
worshippers followed the sacrifice with devout attention; a restless
child now and then broke the silence that pervaded.

A light stole through a long, stained window, throwing shafts of
crimson and purple radiance across the side altar, where stood a carven
image of the Holy Virgin. A girl knelt at the altar rail, her head
bowed, her hands clasped. Even the black-robed sisters, who taught in
the parochial school, now and then raised their eyes to look at her,
for she was so white, her attitude was so supplicating.

Larry Murphy who was very regular at church since Mary died, often
glanced up from his book to look at the pleading figure; but he did not
recognize her, he was too far off, or the light was too dim. It was
Rosie OHara.

With all her pure young heart Rosie was pleading for her love. Right or
wrong she had been taught to carry her griefs to her who had been born
into the world to crush the serpents head; and with an intensity for
which her mind could find no words, she prayed mutely.

The gleaming, richly-wrought vessels had been taken from the tabernacle
and stood upon the pure white altar cloth; the good father bent his
knee, and every head sank in adoration. Rosie, awed to the very soul at
the proximity of the unveiled host, found words--the words of the angel:

Hail Mary, full of grace, she breathed, blessed art thou among
women; and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

At intervals the bell continued to ring softly, the people beat their
breasts; all bent before the uplifted host, save the child, who looked
on, open-eyed, wondering.

Holy Mary, mother of God, pleaded the girl. Pray for us sinners, now
and at the hour of our death!

When the services were ended, Rosie lingered until the priest had left
the altar and the people had gone. Upon her way out she paused. In a
far corner, where the light scarcely fell, hung a pale, white Christ
upon a cross; she knelt and pressed her lips to the wounded feet, her
eyes bright with tears, and then she passed out through the great
swinging doors.

Larry had been one of the first to leave the church; Jimmie Larkin, who
was standing upon Kerrigans corner, saw him, instantly crossed the
street and advanced to meet him.

Larkin! young Murphys voice showed his surprise; and he held out his
hand in a hearty, full-blooded fashion. But Jimmie stuffed his hands
into his pockets, and stared at him, with a sneer.

Aint youse forgot somethin? asked he.

Larry looked his astonishment: Whats hurtin ye? he demanded.

Ye know well enough! Ive bin put next to the cross game yer workin,
Murphy; Im dead on, I tell ye, and Im rotten sorry! I trusted ye, I
did; I trusted youse like I would me brother.

Say, whats the matter with youse, Larkin? Dont stand there like a
stuffed shirt! Put me on to the trouble. What are youse jumpin me for?

Ah! Dont try that; it wont work. I aint sore because I got the
dinky-dink, but ony because youse had a hand in it! You was me pal,
wasnt youse? Didnt I usta sleep with youse? And didnt we eat
together? I borried yer coin when I was strapped, and lent youse mine
when I had any. You knowed all about how it was with me and her,
ye knowed it and done me dirt when me back was turned. Thats the
part what hurts, an Ive broke trainin to come here and lick youse,
Murphy--to lick youse till ye beg!

Larry drew back, frowning into the others flushed face.

I dont know what ye mean, said he, sharply. Yousere a friend o
mine, Larkin, and Ill stand for all kinds o talk from ye, but, say,
if ye go trowin any punches my way, Ill try to give ye a run for yer
trouble.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene is set in a church, where a small group of people are attending mass. One of the worshippers is a young girl named Rosie OHara, who is praying fervently at the altar rail. The other people in the church, including the priest, are paying little attention to her.
Larry Murphy, a regular churchgoer, is sitting in a pew near the back of the church. He notices Rosie and is struck by her beauty and her intensity of prayer. He does not recognize her, however.
As the mass comes to an end, Rosie lingers in the church, praying at the altar of a side altar. When everyone else has left, she goes up to the main altar and kneels before the crucifix, kissing the feet of Christ. She then leaves the church.
Outside, she is met by Jimmie Larkin, who is angry with her for something. He accuses her of being involved in a "cross game" (a con game or swindle), and Rosie denies knowing anything about it. Larkin doesn't believe her and threatens to fight her.
Larry Murphy comes out of the church just in time to see the two of them arguing. He calls out to Larkin, asking him what the problem is. Larkin tells Larry that he knows about the cross game and accuses Larry of being involved in it. Larry denies any knowledge of the game, but Larkin doesn't believe him.
Larkin threatens to fight Larry, but Larry tells him to calm down. He says he doesn't know what Larkin is talking about, and he doesn't want to fight his friend. Larkin doesn't listen, and he swings at Larry, hitting him in the face. Larry falls to the ground, and Larkin starts to kick him.
