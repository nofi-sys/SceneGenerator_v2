SCENE:
I wonder if I should have made that arrangement with him, thought
Margot as she prepared the coffee. In the long run I shall make
more, of course, but meanwhile we shall be hard up. I must be more
careful, that is all. It is an extravagance this taking of trams; from
henceforth I will walk to the theatre, and I will not buy a new hat.
Margot sighed; to buy the new hat would have been flying in the face
of Providence, but not to buy it was to fly even more relentlessly in
the face of pleasure; and Providence might not have minded as much as
Margot.

She tried to sing over the coffee, and she kissed her mothers very
large and rather unappetizing cheek with the heartiness of inveterate
affection; and then, with sheer terror in her heart struggling against
the dauntless courage of youth, Margot set off to the theatre.

It was an icy winter morning, and it is doubtful what would have
happened to her courage if she had not fortified it by an imprudence.
On her way she passed a flower-seller and bought a bunch of violets.
It was an imprudence, as she confessed to herself, but like many other
imprudences it really looked very well, and it gave her a sense of
defiance. If she was to have her head cut off, she would at least
appear at her best for the execution.

There was a sense of quickened suspense in the very atmosphere of the
Odon. The great empty theatre resounded to the angry explosions of
Monsieur Picot, the Stage Manager; the retreating charwomen with dirty
buckets almost hurried to get out of his way. The gathered artists in
the wings or on the stage seemed dipped in whispering gloom. They were
all waiting, it appeared, for Liane, and Liane was late.

Monsieur Picot looked at Margot morosely--she had really done well the
night before, several people had congratulated him about it. It did not
occur to him to repeat the congratulations; he merely remarked that
he supposed she thought he liked wasting his time, for the pleasure
of seeing how late feather-headed nincompoops cared to be! She was
mistaken if she thought so, because he held everybody to witness that
he did not! Everybody had been witnessing it for half an hour and knew
in addition that Margot was not wanted till the fourth act, which
was not timed to take place for another hour but there was a general
assent, and everyone cast looks of scandalized indignation upon Margot.

Then Liane arrived. It at once became obvious that the mornings work,
if it took place at all, would hardly be pleasant.

Liane had a peculiar strained and nervous look in her face, like that
of a horse laying back its ears preparatory to kicking the trap to
pieces. The manager rubbed his hands together and his back cringed with
precautionary amiability. He did not dare reproach Liane for being
late, so he scolded the whole of the rest of the company, who had been
early.

Now, perhaps, since you are at last ready, you set of wooden-heads!
he observed with bitter scorn, you will no longer trespass upon the
patience of Madame!

Liane raised her head and drew back her lips as if she were smiling.

First I must ask permission for a few words with Monsieur le
Rgisseur, she said, with terrible humility. Monsieur Picot shook in
his shoes; he begged his _chre_ Madame to do him the great kindness of
waiting until after the rehearsal.

Until we have those few words there can be no rehearsal, Monsieur,
she replied, still in the deadly undertone of controlled rage.

The Manager gave himself up for lost.

Madame! he said, and bowed the way into his office. The rest of
the company looked at each other and at Margot. They had never liked
Margot, her manner of life disgusted them. A _fille de thtre_ should
behave like a _fille de thtre_ and not like a _fille du monde_;
surely the profession was hard enough without that clumsy addition!

Within the Managers small office, Liane addressed herself to the
mirror and put an ostrich feather straight; she was never more terrible
than when she was arranging her appearance.

_Bon!_ she said. You will have the kindness, Monsieur Picot, to
instantly dismiss the little one who sang last night! her song is not
necessary to the play that is now on, and her taking any part in the
new piece is quite out of the question. I dont know her name; her
voice is execrable, she puts me out.

Monsieur Picot shook his head.

But, Madame, he said persuasively, I am simply desolated if she has
displeased you, this little Selba; to tell the truth, I do not find
that she sings so badly. We cannot all have the charm of a De Brances.
But you are fatigued this morning. Sit down for a few moments, try
this armchair, a cigarette _Non_? Ah! I find them such a rest for the
nerves! Your triumph last night, now that was a sensation! In all
probability you suffer this morning from a reaction. Ah! you geniuses!
All alike, all alike! You conquer the world, but that is not enough for
you, if you fail to find yourself amused next morning!
