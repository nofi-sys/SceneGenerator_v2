Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
"I am a Tumene princess. I know, of course, that your western histories
say practically nothing about us. But if you went to Samarkand or
Kara-Koroum, or indeed no further than Tiflis, you would find in our
ancient Mongolian chronicles things that would amaze you as to the
antiquity of our origin, and you would realize that your Broglies and
Cumberlands are mere parvenus compared with us.

"One Tumene prince was beheaded for his hostility to Yaroslav the Great,
and I will go back no further, least I weary you with jaw-breaking
names. Another, much later, gave Ivan the Terrible so much trouble that
that sovereign preferred to treat with him and sent him magnificent
presents, notably an enormous clock with the signs of the zodiac in
sapphires. This was not enough, however, to prevent that Tumene's son
from assisting the Khan of the Crimea with forty thousand horsemen when
he started out to besiege Moscow, in 1571, if I remember rightly.

"You must not think that we were no better than savages because at first
we fought against the Czars. Boris Godounov was glad enough of our help
against the Tartars, Circassians and Cheremisses. I admit we always
preferred fighting against European enemies. It was Alexis Tumene,
son-in-law of Peter the Great, who led the great charge at Pultawa. As a
reward the Czar ordained that his reforming edicts should not run in
Tumene territories. We have at home a portrait in the style of your
Mignard representing Alexis in a feathered cap, a golden lambskin,
embroidered like a chasuble, and wearing his moustaches long, a fashion
which the Czar had forbidden every one else.

"The first Tumene to shave was my great-grand-father, Vladimir. He it
was who was nearly shot by the orders of Barclay de Tolly. I don't
remember the reason. He was in command of the Astrakhan Cossack Corps
who bivouacked in the Champs-Elyses and apparently played the devil
there. My great-grandfather did a good deal of looting, but converted
his booty into cash which he soon lost at the Palais-Royal. You see he
banked on red, and black came up fourteen times running.

"Vladimir's father was at first on excellent terms with Catherine II.
When she had had enough of him she made him marry a lady from Anhalt.
This was the first time my family had contracted an alliance in this
country. I hope I shall close the list. I don't say that to hurt your
feelings, Melusine, but really that particular German was stupid and
miserly. For instance, of the seven children she gave her husband not
one was in her own image. They were all little Cossacks.

"My grandmother came from Erivan. I am told I'm like her, but she was
better-looking than I. She was madly in love with my grandfather, and
abjured her faith in order to marry him. But before this she adored
shooting, which is a long way the finest faith on earth.

"Papa, who will come into my story again, is the second, member of the
family to marry a German, and once more a Hohenzollem. But you must hear
how it happened. Like his grandfather Vladimir, he was an inveterate
gambler. He took an oath to win back everything his grandfather had lost
in France. Indeed, he would have utterly ruined himself there, if you
ever could ruin yourself with lands as big as six of your departments,
Cossacks too numerous to count and flocks and herds which doubled every
year.

"He always spent ten months of the year in Paris--he was a member of the
Jockey Club--Aix, Nice and every other place to which men of his type
resort. It was at Aix that he met my mother. The year was 1882. One
evening he was at the Villa des Fleurs with King George of Greece and
the Grand Duke Vassily. They had been drinking a good deal and should
not have been alone. Then Papa began to pour out scandal about women,
swearing that they were all alike and that he, a Tumene prince and
obliged to marry to perpetuate his name, had decided to marry any one
Fate threw in his way.

"'All right,' said the Grand Duke, 'marry the first woman who comes in
here.'

"'Certainly, provided, of course, that she's not married already,' added
my father, who was religious.

"'I bet you won't.'

"'How much?'

"'A hundred thousand roubles.'

"'Done.'

"I believe King George of Greece had never had such an amusing time
before. Poor man, I was genuinely grieved when he was assassinated six
months ago. Just imagine, you two, what a scene it must have been, with
those three men waiting for the door to open on her who was to be a
Tumene princess, for they knew my father's obstinacy, and that he would
marry Queen Pomar or Madame Dieulafoy rather than lose his bet.

"The first-comer was my mother, the Duchess Eleanor of Hesse-Darmstadt,
then aged sixteen, and behind her was her English governess. I still
shiver at the thought that, if the Englishwoman had preceded her, Papa
would certainly have married her and I should have been much less
pretty.
