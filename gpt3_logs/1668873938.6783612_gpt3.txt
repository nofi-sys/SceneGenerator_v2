Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
The disgruntled actor took a deep breath, opened his mouth, but then
closed it again. He let out most of the blast he was preparing and
said, quietly but disgustedly, "Why waste my breath? Dusty Britton
doesn't smoke. Dusty Britton drinks soda pop and milk. The only women
in Dusty Britton's life are his aged mother and his younger sister.
Dusty Britton's biggest gamble is when he offers to bet a Saturnstone
on this or that. Hell's Eternal Fire, Gramer, do you realize that I
can't even date a dame for a dance because 'Kids don't care for the
mush stuff!' and my private life is not my own? I can't even swear,
god-dammit!"

Gramer eyed Dusty cynically. "You seem to get along."

"Sure. I get along. When I shuck this monkey suit and dress like a
human being. But you know what happens? When I turn up at some joint,
do I get introduced as _The_ Dusty Britton? Like hell I do. I'm treated
like any of the rest of the dopey tourists. Herded like cattle to the
rear seats, while a tomato like Gloria Bayle lushes in with her fourth
husband and gets the works on the house."

"You make my heart bleed, Dusty."

"Your heart never bled anything but vouchers," snapped Dusty. He
fumbled in his hip pocket and pulled out a flask.

Gramer did not say a word.

"Well, aren't you going to give me an argument?" demanded Dusty.

"No. You can't be seen."

"But someone's likely to smell bourbon on my breath."

"No one that counts. And by the time we get back--"

Dusty stopped raising the flask in midair. "Get back--?" he roared.
"Get back. Look, Gramer--"

"Sit down, Dusty. Take it easy."

"Gramer, what goes on here? You're not suggesting that we take off in
this fire-breathing hot water boiler, are you?"

"You've read all the advertisements."

"Yeah, but nobody with sense would take ad-writer's copy for anything
but guff."

Outside, a bomb burst with an ear-splitting racket. A stentorian voice
thundered, "X Minus Five Minutes!"

"Ye Gods, you're really going through with this madman's publicity
scheme?"

Gramer smiled. "Sure. It's just to Venus; but you can bet your life
that every kid that sees this take-off on video or here on the field
will be dreaming of the fabulous adventures you'll be having. Those
kids _know_ this is for real, Dusty."

"Include me elsewhere," mumbled Dusty. He started for the spacelock.

"You can't let those kids down!" roared Gramer.

Dusty paused at the sill of the spacelock. "Gramer," he said cynically,
"I'm not letting anybody down. I'm just keeping the hide of Dusty
Britton in one unscarred piece."

"But the public--"

"That's what you've got press agents for, Gramer. So you can get your
high-priced publicity men to run a few miles of paper explaining how I
happen to have left this shooting star four minutes before take-off!"

"Dusty, you're a no-good louse."

"But a whole one. And let me tell you this, Gramer, you're less worried
about the state of youthful morals than you are about losing the thread
of a good, high-selling series. So I'm going to sail out of here as
though I was scared to death of rockets--which I sure as hell am--and
you're going to tell some bright explainist to get busy earning the
dough you pay him. And when the smoke is all cleared away, I'll be safe
and you'll be safe, and Dusty Britton will continue to go rolling along
and the box office will continue to come rolling in. Spend a few short
months in space? Not while the geegees are running at Hialeah!"

"But Dusty--"

"Space? Bah! Nothing, floating gently from vacuum to void and back
again. Not for Dusty Britton!"
