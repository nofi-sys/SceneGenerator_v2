Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Dont ask him, replied Jimmy. Hed tell you anything. Hes incapable
of the truth. Say, whats the matter with getting back, fellows?

Oh, theres plenty of time, said Nick. Joking aside, Jimmy, just
what is the big idea?

Go ahead and tell, urged Dud. I dont mind. Besides, they wont
talk.

Oh, you! said Jimmy in disgust. What is there to tell? Well, all
right, fellows. Only this is just between us, understand? Its a little
scheme of my own. You see, Dud here iswell, hes just as you see
him now. He thinks big thoughts and hes a nice boy, but hes a graven
image when he gets outside his room. Well, he likes fun as much as the
rest of us but he doesnt get it because he always thinks he isnt
wanted around. Hehes shy, you know. At least, I suppose thats it. I
never was that way and dont know much about it.

Nick and Hugh laughed.

So I said one day: Dud, I said, you do like I tell you and Ill
have you mixing in no time at all. Ill make a regular feller of you,
and it wont cost you a cent. All youve got to do is what I tell you.
So Dud said: Oh, pshaw! or words to that effect, but agreed to try
the scheme. First thing I did was to make a list of fellows he ought
to know. Then we started in and got acquainted. It was hard sledding
because just as soon as I got him into a bunch of fellows hed get
tongue-tied. Well, I saw that that wouldnt do and so I began to get
off the good things Dud said

All of which you made up? chuckled Nick.

No, not all, honest. Some I did, of course. Dud didnt deliver the
goods fast enough. Andwell, thats all there is to it. Perfectly
legitimate, you see, although Dud has had his doubts now and then and
threatened mutiny once or twice. Weve got on fairly well. I havent
exactly popularized him yet, but I havent done so badly either. Lately
hes been sort of kicking over the traces and refusing to pull, but
were progressing slowly. Now you know all about it. If either of you
chaps blab Ill punch your head.

So thats it, mused Nick. Some scheme, eh, Ighness?

Rather!

Im glad you know, said Dud, embarrassed, because its always seemed
so silly for Jimmy to go around getting off a lot of funny jokes and
crediting them to me, and thenthen for me to just stand around
and act like a dummy. I suppose we went into it as a sort of lark,
orwell, I dont know. I suppose it sounds funny to you chaps. But I
wanted you to know.

I knew already, said Hugh. That is, I guessed a long time ago.

Honest? exclaimed Jimmy. Say, thats queer, because when I asked Dud
which of the fellows hed like to

Shut up, Jimmy! implored Dud.

Why? Theres no harm in it, you chump. I asked Dud who hed like to
know most and he said

_Please_ dry up, Jimmy!

He said Hugh Ordway. Thats why we butted in on you one night a long
while ago.

Really? Well, you know, thats quite a compliment, Baker. Im afraid,
though, you didnt find mewhats the word, Nick?

Responsive?

Well, yes. Or appreciative, I guess; thats better. If Id known

You didnt expect Baker to tell you, did you? asked Nick. If you
really wanted to know a fine, respectable member of the community,
though, Baker, why didnt you select me? I cant understand you wanting
to know this cold-blooded Britisher.

I think we called on you next, answered Dud, laughing.

Did you? Well, thanks for small favors! But look here, Jimmy, its
been fun for you, I guess, but you havent done Baker much good, you
idiot! A fellows got to work out his ownhis own salvation at school.
No one else can do it for him. Now you let Baker hoe his own row,
and

Thats all you know about it, replied Jimmy tranquilly. Dud is on
speaking terms with about every fellow worth knowing now and before I
took him in hand


CONCISE SUMMARY:
