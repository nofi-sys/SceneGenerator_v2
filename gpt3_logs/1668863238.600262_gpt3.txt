SCENE:
Jean buried his face in the long dried grass, and drank in the
haunting, fresh scent of the dead leaves; the air was full of a faint,
warm haze that crept across the distant fields and hung above the
trees. The leaves that were still upon them were very dry with the heat
and rattled a little as the soft breeze shook them together. The birds
spoke in sharp, disconnected twitters; all the sounds and all the life
of the earth seemed interrupted now, and yet urgent. The swallows flung
themselves in long, unsettled curves about the sky; everything was
changing, moving, departing. Jean alone must stay here always to the
bitter sound of his own wasted life! He watched himself grow tamely,
narrowly old, through the coming years; there would be nothing in him
to challenge life. Maurice and his fellow-officers and their fun would
go out once more into the merry world, Jean would remain. In time he
would cease attending the Lyce, he would come home and farm Ucelles.
In the evenings he would play a little if he was not too tired, but
never his own music any more! Why should he shame the divine flickering
gift within him, which he could never develop, nor yet throw away? He
wanted to be a musician--he wanted only that--and he buried his face in
the friendly dry leaves that scratched his cheeks, and wept.

I shall never be able to do anything, sobbed Jean. I shall never be
able to go anywhere, and I shall never meet anyone to love.

Miss Prenderghast waited half an hour for dinner. It was an unfortunate
half hour; in it all the sacrifices she had made for Jean increased
with the inroad he was making upon punctuality.

For the last ten years Miss Prenderghast had been practising the stoic
virtues, and though these are probably the hardest of all the virtues
to practise, they rarely, if ever, make the possessor lovable. In this
one half hour Miss Prenderghast saw their worthlessness, but she could
not admit that she was to blame; surely the guardians of youth only
owed to their special charges the one great duty of correction, to be
met by youth in its turn with implicit obedience? And Miss Prenderghast
knew that she had corrected Jean and that he had usually obeyed her.
Between them these two admirable virtues had destroyed any human
relationship. He is lacking in consideration, said Miss Prenderghast
to herself, and she wiped her glasses. She had given Jean a gold watch
for his birthday present, and he had not kissed her. She had told him
at the time that she hoped it would make him more punctual.

Elizabeth brought in the soup at nine.

Master Jean is very late, said Miss Prenderghast; put something cold
on the sideboard, Elizabeth, and go to bed. I will sit up for him.

There was such a tone of finality in Miss Prenderghasts voice that
Elizabeth almost obeyed her. She put some soup on the kitchen fire and
began to do her hair in curl-papers on the stairs.

Jean came in a few minutes afterwards. He apologized perfunctorily for
the lateness of the hour, and his aunt remarked that careless people
always gave trouble. Jean accepted the thrust in silence; he did not
think it fair to receive an apology with further correction; it had the
result also of drying up any possible springs of remorse.

He is becoming hardened, thought his aunt miserably; then she advised
him not to take butter with meat; she said it was an extravagant habit
and un-English. Jean took more butter.

Miss Prenderghast sighed and shook her head.

Well, Jean, she said at last, I daresay you wonder why I have been
sitting up here for you, just as I have been wondering what has made
you so late. Have you no explanation you can offer me?

No, _ma Tante_, said Jean, without lifting his eyes from his plate.
He looked very guilty.

I would have forgiven him anything if he were not so secretive,
thought his aunt; aloud she said, I am afraid you have been idling--or
worse! You are twenty, old enough to be doing some good in the world
if you have any capacity for it. The time has come for something to be
decided about your future.

Miss Prenderghast was only expressing in her own familiar way the
very thoughts that had kept Jean lingering in the field, but it is
extraordinary how very different our own thoughts about ourselves can
sound from the lips of our nearest relatives! Jean had not felt in the
least hostile to himself as he lay in the long grass, speculating as to
his lack of the talents necessary for life, but he felt very hostile to
Miss Prenderghast now; he kicked the table leg.

I daresay you hardly remember your Uncle Romain, she went on, with
a grieved glance at the furniture; you are hardly likely to, as
hitherto his only interest in you has been displayed by his remarkable
confidence in my powers of bringing you up. However, it appears he has
suddenly remembered that he is your natural guardian, and has written
to suggest a profession for you.
