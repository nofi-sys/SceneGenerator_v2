SCENE:
It is of no use, Mr. Cooke, said Annie, resignedly. The stupid old
woman has gone to market, and we shall have to wait till she comes
back, unless we go and hunt her up where she is making her bargains in
stale cabbages.

But it is abominable to make her lodgers stand kicking their heels in
the blazing sun, while she is haggling over a pennorth of onions!
said he, with another lunge at the door.

Annie meanwhile had been prowling about.

Do you think you could open the kitchen window, Mr. Cooke? she asked,
dubiously. We might get in there. It isnt far from the ground.

It was a small window, just low enough for him to reach the fastening
easily with his pocket-knife. In a few minutes he had pushed the
fastening aside, scrambled up on to the sill, opened the window, and
got in amid the crash of timber.

What have you done? asked Annie, anxiously, as he appeared again,
disguised in flour and paste.

Ive fallen into a lot of things, it seems, said he, and I believe
Ive sprained my ankle.

Oh, my roly-poly pudding! cried Annie, not heeding his ailments in
the unhappy discovery.

Im afraid it is done for now, answered Mr. Cooke, as he removed
the body of the uncooked pudding from his sleeve. It will do for a
poultice for me, however, he said, cheerfully; and Mrs. Briggs will
put it down in both our bills, so it wont be wasted. Wait, Ill give
you a chair to help you up.

She got in; and they both began to look about for something to make
dinner of. Annie went to the cupboard, while Mr. Cooke opened a door
and fell down two steps into the back kitchen with a cry of joy. He
had knocked his head against a skinny-looking bird, already plucked,
which was hanging down from the ceiling. But Annie shook her head
contemptuously when she saw it.

It is one of Mrs. Briggs prehistoric chickens, and it would want a
lot of preparation before we could cook it. Besides, I dont know how,
and the fire is out.

So they hunted again, and, not finding anything but bones and Mr.
Cookes cheese, Aubrey went out to buy chops, having said doubtfully
that he thought he could cook a chop, but wasnt sure, while Miss
Langton set to work to make a fire. When she came back, after a rather
long absence, they were both radiant; for Annie, as she let him in,
told him in great delight that she had made a lovely fire, and found
where the plates, and knives, and forks were kept, and he pulled out of
his pockets a number of small parcels and a gridiron, and produced from
under his arm a huge cookery book, which he laid triumphantly down upon
a bag containing cheese-cakes.

The bakers wife lent me this; so now we can have fifteen courses
if we like. This will tell us how to make a _vol-au-vent  la
financire_, or a _fricandeau de veau_ with _sauce piquante_, or----

But it wont tell us how to cook a chop without burning it to a
cinder, or how to boil a potato when I cant find where they are kept,
said Annie, taking up the gridiron and turned it over thoughtfully.

Why, I can show you what to do with that! said he, with superiority.

And at last, after a great deal of unnecessary trouble and excitement,
and after having burned their hands and scorched their faces and gone
through a sort of purgatory on a hot early September afternoon, they
did succeed in cooking the chops; and then Aubrey danced round them in
affectionate pride, while Annie suggested that they should dine in her
sitting-room, which was only on the other side of the passage.

Oh, no, said Aubrey; let us have it in here, and then we can do some
more cooking!

So they pulled the kitchen-table out of range of the fire, and put bits
of firewood and paper under the rickety legs, and laid the cloth and
arranged the knives and forks with elaborate carefulness, and Aubrey
rushed to the tap and filled a jug which they then discovered to have
contained milk; and, the mania of cooking being still strong upon him,
he insisted on putting the battered cheese-cakes into the oven to
revive them, and then made buttered toast for dessert, to work off
his culinary energy. And Annie laughed at him, and enjoyed herself very
much. And then she suggested boiling some water for coffee, which she
knew how to make, she said.

Yes, because it doesnt require any making. Everything that demands
a little science falls to me, said Aubrey, decisively, putting the
kettle on the fire so that it immediately fell over on its side with a
loud hiss.
