SCENE:
I hope I have not offended you, said Frederick, but I dare not
listen to communications from such a source! If not actually ordained,
I am pledged to become a minister of the Church, and am bound to follow
her commands in everything.

Poor Fred! said the girl, compassionately, I can do nothing more
for you, so I had better go. Good-bye! Believe how I sympathise in
your great trouble--that I would have saved you from it, if I could. I
dont suppose that I shall ever see you again, but I shall never forget
you--never!

She held out her hand to him as she spoke, and the warm human touch
seemed to Frederick Walcheren like a last farewell of the world he had
loved so much.

One moment, Rhoda, he said tremblingly; you said, just now, that
you had had sorrow enough to make you despair. What was it? Was it
connected with me?

You know how you left me, she answered, colouring; surely I neednt
remind you of that.

No, no; but I thought, perhaps--I hoped, as you had said nothing of
it, that--that--

That God had mercifully buried the proof of your treatment of me, with
your other sins, I suppose, Fred, replied the girl, scornfully.

Your mother wrote me a letter some time ago now, I remember (but later
events have put it out of my head), and I sent her a cheque for one
hundred pounds, for expenses, but she returned it to me, and said she
did not want it. And not having heard since--

You flattered yourself you would never hear again, retorted Rhoda.
Well, you were right! You never will! Good-bye!

But he would not let her go.

Tell me, he urged, tell me everything! Dont think, because Im
going to be a priest, that I have lost all trace of human feeling. Is
the child alive and well? Is it a boy or a girl?

What is the good of my telling you? asked Rhoda, dashing away the
tears that had risen to her eyes. Youll never see him, nor will he
call you father. But since you ask me, he is a boy, and strong and
healthy, and I love him dearly. Is that sufficient?

My little son, said Frederick, musingly. The only child I shall ever
have, and him I have disgraced, God forgive me! Rhoda, you must let me
settle some money on this boy before my fortune passes out of my hands.
He is mine; you have no right to refuse me.

No, no, I will not have it; he shall not take it! exclaimed Rhoda,
passionately. Mother and I have enough for him, and he shall never
know who his father is. Dont be afraid but that he will be well looked
after. He is all--all-- with a sudden break in her voice--that I have
left.

In a moment the injury he had done this girl, whose existence he had
almost forgotten, flashed across Frederick Walcherens mind.

Oh! let me make you some amends, he cried. Dont leave me with this
remorse tearing at my heart. If you do, the child and you will come
between me and my prayers. The money is my own still, to do as I will
with. Let me put a thousand pounds in the bank--only a thousand pounds,
Rhoda--in your name, that you may have something to fit the boy out
with when he is of an age to enter the world.

But she shook her head.

I will not take your money, she said. I will not be paid for my
love.

Then what can I do for you? he cried, in a voice of despair. How
can I show you how sorry I am for the past--how much I would do to
repair it?

If you wish to make me happier, she answered, turning so as to face
him, _dont become a priest_. Give up this mad idea. You will regret
it bitterly if you do not. Ah, Fred, she continued, drawing closer to
him, I dont ask--I dont wish to be anything to you ever again, but
come back to the world and live in it a little longer before you take
a step you can never recall. I do not expect, nor ask to receive, your
love. I know that has gone from me to the girl you made your wife,
but if I can comfort you by my friendship and my devotion, it will be
yours to your lifes end. Come back and let me try and comfort you for
all you have lost. I will be your servant and your friend, and nothing
more, so long as I can smooth your path in life. Dear, dear Fred, you
know I loved you! Let us go away to some distant land together till
your grief is assuaged and your mind is more fit to decide upon your
future plans.
