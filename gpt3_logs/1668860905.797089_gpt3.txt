SCENE:
For a moment the great scientist paused, then resumed in steady tones.

"What will happen to the Station in the course of the years I do not
know. I cannot bring myself to do what perhaps should be done--destroy
a source of infection which no power known to science can cleanse. The
radiations are too continuous and pervasive. The Station is drenched
with them, and the disintegration of matter which is still taking place
here will continue for generations.

"We have confined that disintegration to the Station's eighty-nine
power units, but it cannot be arrested without destroying the Station.

"I do not know what kind of Station you will find when you return,
Roger. But this much I know. You will have the resolution to do what I
cannot bring myself to do.

"I do not believe the mutants will endanger Earth, at least not
during my lifetime. There are not too many of them, and it would be
unnecessarily cruel to hospitalize them on Earth. It is best, I think,
that we order our affairs here so that the mutants may be spared. This
place is where they belong. We understand them because we are linked to
them by ties of kinship.

"But you are not, Roger. If, when you return, you feel that the Station
should be destroyed--well, lad, there are weapons in the weapon room
you will know how to use.

"Lad, I leave the future of the Station in your hands. Safe hands they
are, kindly hands, but hands courageous enough to do what must be done.
Goodbye, lad, and good luck!"

The screen went blank.

"Gale come back talk to man from sky!" a harsh voice shouted. "Him we
slay!"

Sheldon swung about, all the blood draining from his face. A dozen
shaggy brutes, their wooden axes gleaming in the cold light, were
advancing stealthily upon him. In horror he saw that the one closest to
him had seized Anne and was pinning her arms to her side.

"Roger, save yourself!" the struggling girl screamed. "They'll kill
you!"

Sheldon's spine seemed to turn to ice. Probably he had never thought
faster in his life. Or moved faster. With a sudden, desperate lunge he
grabbed the projector, raised it and swung it fiercely toward the skull
of the nearest brute.

There was a splintering crash, and a blinding flash of light shot from
the collapsing instrument. It was followed by a pinwheeling blur of
light which encircled the screen and then shot up toward the ceiling.
The next instant all the lights in the library went out, suddenly
plunging the big room in total darkness.

In the darkness Sheldon was aware of harsh breathing, grunts and savage
snarls. For an instant he crouched close to the screen, trembling,
collecting his wits. Then he stumbled forward, not breathing at all. He
could feel perspiration running over his body, drenching him under his
clothes.

Suddenly soft flesh brushed his arm and groping hands found his. He
could see the girl's eyes in the darkness, bright with terror.

"Don't let go of me," she whispered hoarsely, "I can find the door. Let
me guide you."

A moment later Sheldon was out in the corridor, running, with Anne at
his side.

"We've got to get to the ship!" Sheldon's voice was taut with urgency.
"It's our only chance."

"I never thought they'd turn on me!" Anne almost sobbed. "But they're
crazed--maddened by what they saw. They think you've come back to rule
them at Gale's bidding."

Up a narrow stairway they raced, and along another corridor, and then
out beneath the stars.

From the shadows the ship loomed, immense, shadowy, a shape that seemed
all gleaming angles and spiraling curves.

A weird feeling of unreality took hold of Sheldon as he swung open the
port, almost pushed Anne in and stumbled in after her.

But once inside his mind seemed to clear. In less than a minute he was
at the controls.
