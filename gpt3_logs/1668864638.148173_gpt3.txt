SCENE:
She made the statement defiantly, yet there lurked in her eyes an
anguish of entreaty that implored Julie to confirm her.

Why, yes, indeed! Julie answered eagerly. Why, yes, shes liable to
come almost any day now.

But she _dont_ come! She dont come! Oh, my baby! My honey! I want to
see you so bad! Once more the old woman began to rock herself to and
fro hopelessly.

But she will come! Shell come soon now, Julie promised.

Old Miss Fogg gazed up into her face, her mouth hanging open and
tremulous with eagerness, as she gathered encouragement from Julies
assurance. Then her eyes wandered away over the room.

But look! she cried. If she was to come, howm I going to see her
in this pigsty? I ought to fix up; but I aint got the heart--I aint
even got the heart to wash my face, she confessed looking at Julie
piteously, the slow impotent tears gathering in her eyes.

Never mind, never mind, Julie comforted her quickly. You dont have
to worry. Ill fix it all up for you. You lie down now, she coaxed.
Lie down and rest a while, an Ill get things straight.

To her surprise the old woman yielded, and let herself be helped back
into bed, where exhausted by all her storms of emotion, she fell asleep
almost immediately.

That was the beginning of Julie Roses friendship with old Miss Fogg.
Thereafter, as the days went by, tenderly, persistently, baffled
sometimes by the old womans outbreaks of rage and suspicion, or worse
still by the terrible inertia of depression which constantly settled
over her, Julie gradually won her way further and further with the
other, and by the sheer indomitable persistency of her compassion
managed to drag her back occasionally almost to the shore of normal
life. At least her room and her person were clean and in order, and
Julie saw to it that she had regular meals--dainty little lunches
cooked by herself. Sometimes she was rewarded by an outburst of
gratitude, that usually ended in tears. Youre good! the old woman
would cry seizing Julies hand convulsively. I dont know what you
want to be so good to a poor old wreck like me for.

But sometimes she pushed her food away, and refused to eat. Whats
the use of eatin? she would weep. Oh my Lord! Whats the use of
_anything_ in this world? Oh, I wisht I was dead! But I aint even got
ambition enough to die!

Sometimes Julie coaxed her with flattery, into tidying herself up.
That black dress certainly is a handsome piece of goods, and that gray
one, too, she said.

Why, of course I got handsome clothes, Miss Fogg retorted with a
proud jerk of her head. Why, who do you take me for? I dont belong
with all the common trash that lives in this house. Ive sewed for all
the best people in town. I aint used to common people; Im used to
quality. But these folks here--theyre as common as pig-tracks. You
dont spose Id run with them, do you? An Ive always been used to
keeping myself nice an elegant. I wasnt one to lay around in wrappers
all day. But now--Oh my Lord!

Look, Julie hastily interposed, forestalling the rising tears. Just
see how nice you look with your hair fixed like Ive done it to-day.

She held a mirror up, and Miss Fogg peered blindly at herself for a
moment in silence. But as she looked a dim satisfaction grew in her
face.

Why that looks real nice, dont it? she said, turning her head to one
side with self-conscious shyness.

Indeed, with her indomitable persistency Julie had won out of this
human ruin some of the mellowed grace of a more fortunate old age. With
the creative power of her devotion she had gone forth into the dark
waters engulfing the old woman, had struggled there, and dragged her
back into life; and having won a precarious hold upon her affection,
she poured forth the overflowing joy of her heart in her service.

Miss Fogg continued to stare at her reflection, her lip trembling
slightly. It seemed as though the vision of her past self was given
faintly back to her out of the mirror. She bent over and looked still
closer. Why, she said slowly, thats _me_--thats the way I used
to be fore I lost my ambition. She raised her eyes to Julie with
a faltering surprise. Why, she cried, Why youve give me back to
myself.

She patted the ruffles at her neck, and smoothed her hair with a
fleeting return of vanity.

I was always a great hand to keep myself fixed up nice, she boasted.
An now youve put new life into me.
