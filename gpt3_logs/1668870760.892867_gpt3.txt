SCENE:
Veils were dropped, gloves were put on, and a subdued sobbing and
whispering began. All pushed forward anxious to see everything at this
critical and interesting moment. Larry was moved but silent; Mary
sobbed, quietly; Mrs. Kellys grief was stormy; but her husband and son
regarded the body stolidly, then gave way to those behind. In a few
moments the casket lid was screwed down and the six young men had borne
it through the door to the waiting hearse. Young Ferguson took the list
of names and stationed himself by the door.

Mr. Lawrence Murphy and Miss Mary Carroll, called he.

Do she go afore me? demanded Mrs. Kelly. Mr. OConnor is a black
stranger till walk ahead av a sister av the corpse?

Kelly sneered. Sure they have it all their own way, Honora, said he.

Mr. James Kelly and wife, called Ferguson.

Thanks be! cried the angry lady. I wur expectin till be left till
the last! and out she went on the arm of her husband, to treat the
watching crowd to an energetic exhibition of sisterly grief.

Mr. Martin Kelly! cried Roddy. He hesitated a moment, then added:
and Miss Bella Nolan.

Bella came forward, smiling, and took the young mans arm. The sisters
OHara threw looks of malice toward Mrs. McGlory; but the good woman
disdained to notice them.

Go on, Roddy! directed OConnor. Is it aslape ye are?

His assistant had followed Bella and her partner with moody eyes,
and now stood gazing at the empty doorway. But he roused himself at
OConnors voice and before his abstraction was noticed by anyone else
he continued:

James Larkin, and Miss Rosie OHara.

Divil the bit will she, broke in the latters father. Rosie walks
wid me, an not wid the son av an Orangeman!

Rosie grew red, and the tears sprang into her eyes; Jimmie hesitated,
uncertain how to act, but at a glance from Rosie, he drew back and
allowed her father to lead her out.

What a shame! said good-natured Mrs. McGonagle.

Will nothin do the cub but Rosie? sneered Bridget.

I dont like his trade, said Mrs. Clancy, but hes a foine young
felly.

Hes his fathers son, said Ellen, bitingly.

The list of names was gone quickly through; those intending to walk in
the cortge as far as the church fell in, and all moved slowly down the
street, OConnor at their head.

Larry Murphys recollections of what followed were but dim; through
a sort of haze he heard the chanting priests, and saw the swinging
censers, and his mind retained but little of what the pastor said in
regard to the old mans life and acts. He had been but a child when
his father lay at the same altar rail, but his remembrance of that was
vivid. The organ was silent then; the church was deserted save for a
few friends, and a single priest performed the hurried service. It
came back to him that he had cried bitterly; not that he had much idea
of what was happening, but the dull light that crept in through the
stained windows seemed to add to the gloom that filled the church, and
a vague sense of loss had clutched at his childish heart. He did not
begrudge the pomp that marked his grandfathers burial services, but
he thought that the old man could have spared a little from his store,
that his dead son might have gone to the grave in a fitting manner, and
not wait until deaths hand was upon him before giving a sign.

But it was all over now; the pall-bearers had drunk their glasses of
red wine, crumbled their pieces of sweet cake, shaken hands with Larry
and departed. The Kellys had remained until Johnnie Kerrigan had
informed them that the entire property had gone to Larry, and then left
in a gust of anger.

The young man and Mary were alone. She sat by the window, crying
softly; he stood with his back to the stove, his hands clasped behind
him, staring at the bright pattern in the carpet.

He was trying to think of something to say that would ease her grief;
but all that came to his mind seemed vapid and without much meaning. He
had been thinking of her a great deal during the last few days and it
hurt him to see her cry. He had never spoken to her before the day of
his grandfathers death; but he had seen her often on the street and at
the church--when he went there--and he had often marvelled at the calm
purity of her face. He had heard much of her in different ways; of her
goodness of heart, of her gentle ways, of her deep love and veneration
for the faith in which she had been reared. He had lived rough, a young
man in his place could hardly help it; and he had seen, and said, and
done things which would have made him hang his head had she known; but,
for all, he liked, as most men do, reverence for holy things in a
woman. It was Mary that broke the silence.
