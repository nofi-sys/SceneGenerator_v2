SCENE:
Let us hope that our good neighbor, Captain Mayo, will come out of his
adventure unscathed, said Squire Knowles.

Hes in a close corner, squire, but if it were left to me to choose
a man from our town capable of fighting the enemy inch by inch in any
game they like to play, I think I couldnt make a better choice than
Hoppy.

Peters words evoked loud applause from the meeting.

Have you heard from Brewster, Mr. Chairman? asked the Rev. Mr. Shaw.

I have, sir. Major Elijah Cobb of that town informs me that the people
are much divided on the question of offering resistance in case of
a demand for tribute. Their artillery company is not in first-class
condition and the gallant major is afraid that the two small pieces
they have will make a poor showing against the well-armed enemy. There
is much capital invested in the salt-making industry there and the
proprietors of the works are naturally anxious to avoid a bombardment.
They are willing to pay a reasonable sum for immunity.

They are in the same fix as ourselves, remarked Captain Heman Smith.

Conditions are practically the same in all the towns from Brewster
to Provincetown. The exception, if we may so term it, is Orleans,
said the chairman. There is a majority in that town in favor of armed
resistance. I have discussed the matter with Squire Kingman and Major
Henry Knowles and they tell me the die is cast--Orleans will fight to
the end.

Orleans is showing great pluck for a young town, said Captain Smith.
Only seventeen years ago it was the South Precinct of Eastham; now it
outranks the mother town as a military centre.

Eastham has lost a lot of its former importance, Captain Smith, but
the people of Orleans are still our own flesh and blood, was the
chairmans comment on this.

Then Timothy Cole made a suggestion: I think, Mr. Chairman, we had
better postpone a vote until we have an opportunity to judge what the
intentions of the schooner are. She will probably work her way eastward
tomorrow and we can all take a hand at watching her movements.

That seems to be the sensible thing to do, Timothy, assented the
chairman.

Timothys suggestion was received with favor by the meeting and the
session was closed.

That night Captain Jared Higgins sat up late. The gallant skipper was
busy, but any person observing the task he was engaged in would find
it hard to reconcile it with his prominence as an advocate of peace.
His family had retired for the night before his labors commenced. The
man of peace took an old firelock from the hooks where it had rested
untouched for many a year and laid it gently on the table. Then he
reached for the ancient cutlass which hung beside the chimney and
placed it alongside the gun. From the drawer of an immense cupboard he
brought forth two large horse pistols and added them to the weapons
on the table. After this, he lighted an extra candle and stood back,
grimly surveying the array of warlike gear.

A knock at the door caused Captain Jared to start. Who could be around
at this time of night? A second knock and the sound of a friendly voice
asking if he were in, brought him to the door which he opened to admit
his adversary of the tavern, Obed Sparrow.

I hope I havent put you out any, Captain Jared? The fact is, I felt
so much ashamed of that evening at Crosbys that I thought it right to
come and tell you so. I have been down at Peters and on my way home I
saw your light. I hope there are no hard feelings left, Captain Jared?

The worthy captain felt his position rather uncomfortable just at
that moment. Obed could not fail to notice the lethal weapons on the
table and would surely wonder why the man of peace, Jared Higgins, had
brought them forth for inspection.

Dont talk about it, Obed; no hard feelings at all, my lad. These are
ticklish times, Obed, and the slowest of us is apt to feel the strain
on his temper. Sit down and smoke a pipe.

Obeds eye settled on the table. He certainly was surprised and showed
it.

By George, Captain Jared, but thats a queer sight to see on the table
of a man who hates fighting as you do! he exclaimed.

Well, Obed, said the captain confusedly, I just thought Id have
a look at the old kit of fighting tools which I used during the
Revolution. Kind o seemed to me that they wanted cleaning.
