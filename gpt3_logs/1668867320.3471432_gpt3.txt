SCENE:
He stumbled and went to one knee and as he staggered to rise I thought
that I had him, when we heard the hurrying feet of men descending the
stairs. Instantly Bethelda hurled the flare to the floor, leaving us in
utter darkness.

Come! she whispered, laying a hand upon my arm. There will be too
many nowwe must escape as they enter or we are both indeed lost.

The warriors were cursing at the doorway now and calling for lights.

Who hides within? shouted one. Stand forth, a prisoner! We are a
hundred blades.

Bethelda and I edged nearer the doorway, hoping to pass out among them
before a light was made. From the center of the room came a deep groan
from where I had left Raban, followed by a scuffling noise upon the
floor and a strange gurgling. I came to the doorway, leading Bethelda by
the hand. I found it choked with men.

Aside! I said. I will fetch a light.

A sword point was shoved against my belly. Back! warned a voice behind
the point. We will have a look at you before you passanother is
bringing a light.

I stepped back and crossed my sword with his. Perhaps I could hew my way
to freedom with Bethelda in the confusion of the darkness. It seemed our
only hope, for to be caught by Rabans minions now, after the hurts I
had inflicted upon him, would mean sure death for me and worse for
Bethelda.

By the feel of our steel we fenced in the dark, but I could not reach
him, nor he me, though I felt that he was a master swordsman. I thought
that I was gaining an advantage when I saw the flicker of a light coming
from the doorway at the head of the stairs. Someone was coming with a
flare. I redoubled my efforts, but to no avail.

And then the light came and as it fell upon the warriors in the doorway
I stepped back, astounded, and dropped my point. The light that revealed
them illumined my own face, and at sight of it my antagonist voiced a
cry of joy.

Red Hawk! he cried and seized me by the shoulder. It was The Vulture,
my brother, and with him were The Rattlesnake and a hundred warriors of
our own beloved clans. Other lights were brought and I saw Okonnor and a
host of strange warriors in Kalkar trappings pushing down the stairway
with my own, nor did they raise sword against one another.

Okonnor pointed toward the center of the chamber, and we looked and
there lay Raban, the giant, dead. The Red Hawk, Julian 20th, he said,
turning to those crowding into the chamber behind him, Great Chief of
the Tribe of Juliansour chief!

And Jemadar of all America! cried another voice and the warriors,
crowding into the room, raised their swords and their hoarse voices in
acclamation. And he who had named me thus pushed past them and faced me
and I saw that he was no other than the true Or-tis with whom I had been
imprisoned in The Capital and with whom I had escaped. He saw Bethelda
and rushed forward and took her in his arms, and for a moment I was
jealous, forgetting that he was her brother.

And how has all this happened, I asked, that Or-tis and Julian come
here together in peace?

Listen, said my brother, before you pass judgment upon us. Long has
run the feud between Julian and Or-tis for the crime of a man dead now
hundreds of years. Few enough are the Americans of pure blood that they
should be separated by hate when they would come together in friendship.
Came the Or-tis to us after escaping the Kalkars and told of your escape
and of the wish of his father that peace be made between us, and he
offered to lead us against the Kalkars by ways that we did not know and
The Wolf took council with me and there was also The Rock, The
Rattlesnake and The Coyote, with every other chief who was at the front,
and in your absence I dissolved the feud that has lain between us and
the chiefs applauded my decision. Then, guided by the Or-tis, we entered
The Capital and drove the Kalkars before us. Great are their numbers,
but they have not The Flag with them and they must fall.

Then, he continued, came word, brought by the little Nipons of the
hills, that you were in the mountains near the tent of Raban the Giant
and we came to find you, and on the way we met Okonnor with many
warriors and glad were they of the peace that had been made, and we
joined with them who were also riding against Raban to rescue the sister
of the Or-tis. And we are here awaiting the word of The Great Chief. If
it is for peace between the Julian and the Or-tis, we are glad; if it is
for war our swords are ready.

It is for peace, ever, I replied and the Or-tis came and knelt at my
feet and took my hand in his.
