SCENE:
IX.

BESIEGED.

Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp,
When Agrican, with all his northern powers,
Besieged Albracca, as romances tell.
PARADISE REGAINED.


An hour after the last scene, Manton returned to his room, and, seeming
greatly hurried, lit his lamp, and throwing himself into a chair,
seized his pen, muttering between his teeth, It must be finished
to-night! a _man_ has no right to be tired! He was drawing his writing
materials towards him, to proceed with his work, when a something of
strange disorder among his papers caught his quick eye.

Ah! who has been disturbing my papers? and as a flash of suspicion
shot through him, he sprang to his feet, exclaiming, my trunks, no
doubt, have shared the inquisition! and stepping quickly to them, he
threw up the lids.

By Heaven, it is so! what accursed carelessness this is of mine,
leaving everything unlocked in this fashion!

His first glance had shown him that the trunks had been disturbed,
and a cautious effort been made to replace the contents as they were
before. Uttering some energetic expletives of wrath, he knelt beside
one to ascertain how far the examination had been carried, when,
reaching the packages of letters and papers at the bottom, he saw
there, too, unmistakable evidence of a pretty thorough examination
having been held of their contents.

If he had been enraged before, this filled him with uncontrollable
fury. He stamped his foot heavily upon the floor, and his whole frame
shook violently, while with gnashing teeth he called down a fearful
imprecation upon the head of this wretched violator, whoever it might
be, of the sad and mournful secrets of his past life, which he had held
sealed in his own bosom, so sternly, so long, and, alas! so vainly.
Those letters revealed all. Some prying reptile had thus slimed the
holy penetralia of his proud life!

The very thought was horrorloathing! A shudder of unutterable disgust
crept through him; an uncontrollable fury blazed through his soul;
his eyes glittered with almost demoniac fire; his face turned deathly
white, and his teeth ground and clattered like the clamp of a wild
boars tusks, and yet he made no tragic start; he stood still, with his
arms clutching each other across his breast, and his eyes looking out
into the blank distance, through which their concentrated light seemed
to pierce to some far object. He at length pronounced slowly

Yes, my curse shall follow you; be you man or woman, it shall overtake
you in terror! I feel the prophecy in me! The wretch who has thus
contaminated those chaste and loved mementoes, shall yet feel my curse!
My consciousness is filled with it! I know not how, or when, or where!
my curse shall reach and blast the author of this sacrilege!bah! and
his face writhed into the devilish mockery of a smile; it is almost
sufficient vengeance, one would think, that the wretch found no money!

Starting suddenly forward, he commenced pacing to and fro with long
strides, with knitted brows, compressed lips, and eyes bent upon the
floor.For more than an hour he thus silently communed with himself,
without the change of a muscle in expression, when drawing a long sigh,
he threw off this frigid look in a degree, merely saying in a low
voice, My curse is good! and returned to the table to resume his seat
and his labors.

As he did so, his eye fell upon a note directed to himself, which, as
it had been placed in no very conspicuous position among the objects on
the table, had, till now, escaped his attention. He reached it, and the
dainty crow-quilled hand of the superscription, the snowy envelope,
and the pure white seal, disclosed at once the woman.He regarded
it for a moment, coldly, and without any expression of interest or
surprise, and with a slight sneer upon his face, broke the seal, when
out slipped a gilt-edged note, which he opened and read aloud with a
jeering tone:

FRIENDMay I not claim to be thy friend in common with the whole
world, who have learned to love thee, through thy beautiful thoughts?
Stricken, sad, and suicidal child of genius, may I not steal into
the tigers lair of thy savage isolation, to bring one single ray of
blessing, to tell thee how, at least, one human soul has throbbed
to the seraphic eloquence of powers, that, alas!I appeal to your
inmost consciousness!are being rapidly destroyed by your obstinate
seclusion in labor, and by the vices of wine and tobacco, which
are its necessary attendants. You have it in you to be saved; your
soul is tall and strong as an archangel; your vices are the withes
of grass that bind you; and love, social love, the calm and genial
reciprocation of domestic sympathies, can alone redeem you.
