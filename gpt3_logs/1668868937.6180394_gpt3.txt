SCENE:
Hi recognised the captain at once. He was the little, short, fierce,
bullet-headed snappy man who had forbidden him to land at La Boca. His
yellow eyes were still bloodshot with rage. He was barking at one of the
teamsters, who had perhaps made some rash or unfortunate reply. After he
had sworn at this man, he gave an order to some of his men, who threw
the teamster to the ground and bent his head down to his knees. Two
Indians then pressed a piece of wood across the back of his neck and
lashed it there with strips of hide. Hi knew at once that they were
going to make the man what is called a broody hen; his father had told
him of this torture. But before the order could be given to complete the
trussing of the victim, the officer looked up, and recognised Hi.

Ah, he said, the Inglays from La Boca; the Inglays with the too much
talk.

Si, Hi said.

Then you did not land at Carpinche as I bade?

Yes, I did.

Yes, the officer said. But what does Mr. Inglays do here, on the
Meruel Road, after being told to stay in Carpinche?

Im going to Anselmo.

To Anselmo? And where is your permit to go to Anselmo?

Surely I do not need a permit. I am English.

So? He does not need a permit: he is Inglays. To whom is the Inglays
going in Anselmo?

Im not going to anybody. I want to see that angel on the tower.

Ah, to see the angel on the tower? A holy Inglays. You will come to
Ribote, where your angel of the tower shall be a little searched into.
You are under arrest.

Im English, Hi said. I have not broken any of your laws. You had
better let me go.

It is for me to judge whether to let you go, the officer said, and
whether you have broken the laws. You are walking without a permit on a
forbidden road. You will come with me to Ribote.

But I can prove that I am doing no harm, Hi said.

If you can prove it, you can prove it at Ribote, the officer answered.
But to Ribote you will certainly come.

He turned his back upon Hi. He left him in charge of two troopers, while
he strolled away to drink his mat. When he had finished his mat, he
gave orders that Hi should mount a spare horse. When the troop had
formed up, with Hi in the midst of them, they set off at a quick pace
along the great road to the south. It was half-past five, as Hi judged,
when they set out. The mountains were stretching their shadows like
fingers along the plain. Glancing back, he saw the angel of the tower of
Anselmo growing smaller and smaller. We are miles from Anselmo now, he
thought. It will be midnight now before I can get there. He had no
fears for himself. They wont really dare to harm me, he thought, but
he did bother acutely about the delay of the message. Heres the whole
day gone, he thought, and I havent started yet and these beasts may
jail me for a week.

He was going, as far as he could judge, south or south with a little
east in it. Presently they were riding in the dark, except for a flaring
lower sky behind them and the young moon westering over the plain. This
is ten miles, he thought, or fifteen miles from Anselmo. I am no
nearer than I was in Santa Barbara.

At about seven or later he saw lights in front of him running up a
slope. They came into a town of some size built on the side of a hill,
which was crowned with pine trees. Here is Ribote, he thought. The
town, though it was mainly a collection of wooden houses, was lit with
electric light. Near the entrance of the town there was a big enclosure
containing a mansion. The troop rode past this, up the hill to an
important stone building, which looked like a large public-house
partially converted into a Greek temple. As it had a flagstaff with two
small guns in front of it, Hi judged it to be the city hall. The troop
halted outside this hall. The officer with about a dozen men dismounted,
drew their revolvers and entered. Perhaps thirty seconds later there
came a cry from within and shots were fired. A few minutes later, three
men, the better sort of citizen, were brought out from the hall. As the
officer brought these men into the open, he caught sight of Hi, whom he
seemed to have forgotten.

Here is this Inglays again, he said. You shall rest from your horse
ride.
