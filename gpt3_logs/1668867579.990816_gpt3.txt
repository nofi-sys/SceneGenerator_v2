SCENE:
XII THE WATER CHASE


Those on the hurricane deck waited eagerly to see what would meet
their vision as soon as the submersible rounded the lower end of the
island. They were now gliding swiftly along, and presently the last of
the palmettoes and mangroves would be passed, when, doubtless, a full
sweep of the sea beyond must reward them.

There they are, Captain! cried Ballyhoo, pointing.

The boat lay in full sight, with its stern toward them. Already those
in the small cedar launch must have taken the alarm, knowing full well
that pursuit would follow discovery. Plainly the little popping sound
of the exhaust connected with the overboard motor came to the ears
of the boys, showing that the man in the stern had instantly set his
engine going, and was leaving the muffler open in the hope of gaining a
little additional speed.

So the chase began, for the submarine was now heading directly after
the launch, and throwing off a white bone from her squat bow.

Whoo! were gaining hand over fist on the bally thing! asserted
the Jones boy, after a couple of minutes had elapsed, and there was a
chance to make comparisons.

Everybody could see that this was so; even the three men in the launch
must have realized that it was only a question of time when the
submarine would overtake them.

That man in the stern is crouching there as if he meant to do
something, Captain! called out Ballyhoo; while Jack was grinding away
at his crank, and getting it all in for future reference; because they
would doubtless often wish to recall these tempestuous happenings when
once more safe at home, and the living, moving thing must far excel
mere word painting.

I saw a little flash then, asserted Oscar, as if he gripped
something in his hand. I wouldnt be surprised now if he had a weapon
of some sort, perhaps a revolver!

Do you believe hed actually _shoot_ at us? asked Jack, doubtless
thinking more about his camera than himself, should hostilities open.

Better be ready to duck down in case he does, warned the captain.
That Badger generally surrounds himself with the same kind of men he
is himself; and hed shoot at the drop of the hat. But well soon fix
that bunch, dont forget it.

The efforts of the three men in the little cedar launch to escape were
almost pitiful, Oscar thought. Still, they could not attempt a thing to
increase their speed, for the motor was doing its best already.

All of them seemed to crouch there, and wait for what was going to
happen. Possibly the man at the stern expected that the submersible
would try to draw up alongside, meaning thus to capture the motor-boat;
and it may have been his intention, by a quick flirt to one side, to
avoid the contact. Thus by playing at a game of hide-and-seek, and by
clever dodging, they might be able to defy the efforts of the others to
capture them.

Straight at the launch pushed the larger boat. The distance had been
cut down to one-third by now. Those on the deck of the submarine could
see the faces of the three men clearly, and note the looks of anxiety
that had settled there as they watched the rapid overhauling of their
craft.

Hey! better keep away, Captain Shooks! shouted the one in the stern,
waving the object he held in his hand, and which the boys could now
see was indeed an automatic pistol, a dangerous looking weapon in the
bargain.

Get out of the road, you lubbers! roared the skipper, as though in
anger; dont you see were in a hurry? What dye mean blocking our way
like that?

It must have burst upon the minds of the three men in the small boat
what fate was in store for them, and that the submarine captain fully
intended to run them down. The two in the middle of the boat acted as
though ready to jump overboard at the last moment, rather than remain
to take the chances of being hit by the bow of the rushing submersible.

That fellow at the motor was made of different stuff, however. He
immediately raised his arm as though bent on carrying out his loud
threat.

Drop down, lads! cried Captain Shooks, who thus showed that he could
be discreet as well as reckless.

All of them hastened to obey, that is, all but Jack, who, despite the
danger, continued grinding away as though bent on accepting all sorts
of risks rather than spoil so good a picture by stops.
