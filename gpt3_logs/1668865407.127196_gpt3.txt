SCENE:
The girl turned and looked him full in the face. Was it possible that
he could be so selfish and absorbed in his own sorrows, as entirely to
have forgotten hers?

You dont mean to tell me that you cared for me as much as all that?
demanded Frederick, with a touch of the old vanity.

No! she answered, no! I did not care for you as much as all that,
and if I had done so, the time is past for telling you of it! Let
me finish what I was going to say to you! Be warned by me! If you
become a priest, you will regret it. You are not fitted by nature or
constitution, for such an artificial life, neither is your present
feeling a permanent one. I feel it! Something tells me so! Your mind
has been upset, and you are not capable of judging for yourself! Dont
take the final step without further consideration. And tell me one
thing! Do you know a man, not very tall but rather stout--with blue
eyes and fair hair, parted down the middle--a man with a pleasant smile
and manner, and who is especially natty about his hands and nails?

Yes, yes! cried the young man; what of him? I recognise your
description perfectly.

He is an enemy of yours, Fred! replied Rhoda. I was told to tell you
that he--

Stop! cried Frederick, suddenly. _Who_ told you?

Mother did, last night, or some of her controls. I told you, ages ago,
you may remember, that she has the gift of second sight.

A soothsayer--a woman with a familiar spirit--condemned alike of God
and our holy Church! exclaimed her companion excitedly, and you bring
me warnings and admonitions from such a source! Away--silence! I will
hear no more of it. I sin each moment that I listen. My poor friend,
do you know the danger you run by giving heed to anything you may hear
from such a source? You are playing with the devil--listening to his
advice, delivering your soul into his hands. You must promise me never
to have any dealings with such people again, or you will imperil your
immortal soul.

But Rhoda, though deeply attached to the man before her, was too
sensible a woman not to have opinions of her own, and the courage to
stick up for them, into the bargain.

Not have dealings with my own mother! she retorted; what will you
tell me next, I wonder! If you dont choose to heed what I say to you,
its no fault of mine, Fred, but Ive done my duty in telling you what
was told to me. And as for its being wrong, I dont believe it. If my
mothers controls were evil spirits, why did they warn me against you
before ever I came to London, and say that nothing but trouble would
come of our intimacy? Why didnt they tell me that life was short in
this world, and I had better make the most of it whilst it lasted,
instead? No! that was _your_ teaching, not theirs; but youd like to
make out your principles the better of the two! You may not take my
advice. I cant help that, but dont set up your own against it, for
youll only anger me, and I came to see you from a pure wish to do you
good.

And with that, and a suspicious sound in her voice as if she could not
trust herself to speak any more, Rhoda gathered up a little shawl she
had carried over her arm, and her umbrella, and prepared to quit the
room.

Rhoda, dont be vexed with what I said, replied Frederick. You did
it in good faith, I am sure, but I must obey the teachings of our most
holy Church on the subject. She strictly forbids all tampering with
such knowledge--with any communications from spirits of the dead. We
are taught to regard them with horror, as temptations from the Evil
One, and sent in order to lure us to our own damnation.

Yes, said Rhoda, incredulously. But I thought that saints in the
Roman Catholic Church were often made so, because they had seen or
talked with spirits of the dead, and that the Pope called a convocation
to decide if such reports were true, and, if they were, the saintship
was confirmed.

That may be correct, Rhoda, but it is very different!

How?

Frederick began to fidget.

Well, you see, the reports, as you say, are confirmed by a court of
inquiry, and established by the approval of the Church, so that there
remains no doubt of their honesty and--

You need say no more, Fred! My mother is as much to me as your Church
is to you--perhaps a little more--and I have the same faith in her
honesty, and impossibility of dealing with the devil, so that we may
cry quits.
