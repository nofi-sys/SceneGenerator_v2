SCENE:
It was consolation of a kind; but he was as sick and shaking from cold
and misery as most fevers could have made him. He noticed after a time
that he was going uphill again. After some hours of this he came into a
forest of giant trees. There was no undergrowth and little light in this
forest. He rode in a gloom full of sighing like voices and full of
dropping like footsteps. The rain seeped in films and streaks through
this wood: mists of it paused in places, like ghosts looking at him from
behind trees. Sudden gusts sent rushes of water to the ground with the
noise of the steps of beasts. It was in this wood that the rain began to
slacken.

At first, he thought that this was only a seeming, due to the shelter of
the trees; but soon the mists of the rain cleared from the boles, which
at once became like gods for bulk and silence. Soon the birds and
insects reappeared; ants came to forage among what the rain had brought
to earth; ticks fell from the trees; the big red and yellow fungi at the
tree roots unrolled themselves into enormous spiders which waved their
front legs at Hi in a terrifying rhythm, as though they were trying to
hypnotise him. They did it slowly, with their eyes fixed upon him. They
seemed to be repeating:

Fee, Fi, Fo, Fum,
I smell the blood of an Englishman.

Hi could see no tracks anywhere on that wet earth, but he realised that
his horse was leading him somewhere.

Good old boy, he said, you know more about these parts than I do. If
you can bring me to any comfort Ill be grateful.

A long time passed before comfort appeared. It came with the brightening
of the light in the gaps among the tree-tops: the very sight of this was
warmth to him. The sun, he said, Ill do it yet, if I can only find
someone to direct me. The horse went straight ahead till at about two
in the afternoon, as Hi guessed, he paused and whinnied, and horses
whinnied in reply.

There, at a little distance in front of him, on a level patch, where the
trees, being small, had been easily cleared, was a hut or shack with
smoke rising from the chimney. It was a white mans, not an Indians
hut, because it was sided and ended with unbarked planks and roofed with
shingles. It was old and falling to pieces. It must have been deserted
for years, Hi thought, yet smoke was rising from it. Beside it was a
long, ruinous pent-house or shed, with a torn canvas crib or manger
running along its wall. I suppose it is an outlying camp, Hi thought,
or some old winter house for the timber cutters; anyhow, thank Heaven,
there are people there. He could see two pale faces peering round the
half-opened door at him. When he lifted his eyes from the house, he saw,
at a little distance, two tethered horses pausing from their grass to
stare at him. As he advanced from his halting place, the faces at the
door moved forward, so that he could make out a man and a woman. The man
advanced to a pace beyond the door. He was a short, fresh-coloured man,
with fair hair, and a small sandy moustache. What Hi noticed more
particularly was that the man looked guilty, as though he had been
caught in the act of something. Hes scared at something, Hi thought.
When the man saw that Hi was only a boy, a relief came over his face, a
relief so great that it made him laugh unpleasantly.

The woman had drawn back out of sight inside the shed, where (from the
sound) she seemed to be doing something with bedclothes, making a bed or
packing something in blankets. Hi thought: Theres something fishy
here. Ive caught them in the act at something. And it must be pretty
bad or he wouldnt be in such a funk.

Is this the way to Anselmo? Hi asked. The man looked blank. Hi
repeated the question, more than once; after a while the woman came to
the door.

Anselmo? she asked.

Si, si, Anselmo.

Por aqui, Anselmo.

She was a willowy woman, all slink and gleam, with a speck in one eye
and something swollen in lip and nose.

This is, then, the way to Anselmo, Hi said. La via a Anselmo? The
calle or route a lAnselmo?

Si, si, the woman said, nodding.

The first wish of the couple, to get the stranger away from the hut,
without letting him peep inside, now changed to another wish: a strange
look passed between them, which made Hi uneasy. The man had enormous
fore-arm muscles: his right fore-arm had been bruised or scraped quite
recently. In his trousers he had a gun pocket which plainly had been
used for a gun, though no gun was there at the moment.

Por aqui, Anselmo, the man said, taking His bridle and turning the
horse away from the shack.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The literary style of this scene is one of suspense and unease. The tone is tense and the point of view is from Hi's perspective. The reader is left wondering what is going on with the man and woman and what they are hiding.
