SCENE:
Every day Sylvia claimed a part of his day, but the remaining hours
were worth months to him in that recent time when he was nothing better
than an intellectual dram drinker. Bulstrode saw it, and said to him:

If you live long enough, youll write that book.

If he lived long enough! But why should he not live?

That night, sitting alone in the library, working eagerly and
effectively at that great preliminary plan, he remembered Bulstrodes
remark, and went and looked at himself in a small mirror in a corner
to examine the signs of age upon him. Yes, the lines were there. But
then the ever-sweet consciousness came to him that Sylvia did not
think him old; that Sylvia would marry him to-morrow and go to live
in the overseers house if he asked her. It came with a sweetness of
consolation to him. He was at the very point where the old age of youth
had not yet merged into the youth of old age; forty was a good deal
older in 1820 than in 19--.

There was one person, though, who thought forty was very old--for a
man, although fifty was comparatively young for a woman--and that was
Mrs. Shapleigh. That excellent woman was in mortal terror of her future
son-in-law, but she revenged herself by great freedom in her remarks
about him behind his back, as far as she dared, to Sylvia.

Sylvia was indubitably a perfect fool about Skelton, as her mother
reminded her a dozen times a day. When Sylvia would cunningly place
herself at a window which looked across the fields to Deerchase, Mrs.
Shapleigh would remark fretfully:

Sylvia, I declare you behave like a lunatic about Richard Skelton. Im
sure I was as much in love with your father as any well brought up girl
might be, but I assure you it never cost me a wink of sleep.

Very probably, mamma.

And I was so afraid some one would know it, that I never breathed a
word of our engagement to a soul. Its true, some people suspected
it after we went to a party at Newington and danced ten quadrilles
together, one after the other, but I denied we were engaged up to two
weeks before the wedding.

Did you say ten quadrilles, mamma?

Yes, ten.

Im sure Mr. Skelton and I will never dance ten quadrilles in one
evening with each other.

And your father was a much younger and handsomer man than Richard
Skelton, who has crows-feet in the corners of his eyes.

I like crows-feet. They impart an air of thoughtful distinction to a
man.

And Mr. Skelton has a bald place as big as a dollar on the top of his
head. Does that add an air of thoughtful distinction, too?

Of course it does. There is something captivating in Mr. Skeltons
baldness; it is unique, like himself. It makes me more and more
delighted at the idea that I am going to be married to him.

Sylvia! shrieked Mrs. Shapleigh, do you dare to be so bold and
forward as to say that you _want_ to marry Mr. Skelton?

Yes, indeed, mamma--dreadfully.

Mrs. Shapleigh raised her hands and let them fall in her lap in despair.

For a girl to acknowledge such a thing! Now, if you wanted to be
mistress of Deerchase, thered be no harm in it; but to want to marry
a man because you are in love with him! Dear, dear, dear! what is the
world coming to?

Sylvia laughed with shameless merriment at this, and just then the door
opened and old Tom came in.

Mr. Shapleigh, began Mrs. Shapleigh in a complaining voice, Sylvias
not at all like me.

Not a bit, cheerfully assented old Tom.

She isnt ashamed to say that she is in love with Richard Skelton, and
wants to marry him. Nobody ever heard me say, Mr. Shapleigh, that I was
in love with you, or wanted to marry you.

No, indeed, madam. It was not worth while. You hung upon me like ivy
on a brick wall.

La, Mr. Shapleigh, how you talk!
