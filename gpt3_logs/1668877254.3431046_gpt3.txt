SCENE:
Rosamund looked at him, half amused, half questioning.

But why theosophic tendencies? she demanded. I am, she added,
peculiarly ignorant of that trend of thought.

John laughed.

Nor am I vastly learned, for that matter. If I were to attempt to
define I think I should say that, where your scientist pure and simple
may deny the existence of God at all, your man, like Corin, with the
curious intermixture of a dreamer, acknowledges the existence of this
Supreme Power, even endows that Power with a certain mysticism, but
at the same time reduces--or attempts to reduce--all the actions and
manifestations of the Power to terms comprehensible by the finite
understanding.

Yes? she queried. It was evident she desired to hear more.

Oh, smiled John, its too complicated an affair to compress into
a sentence or two. But take, for instance, pain--the apparently
undeserved and ghastly suffering with which one is sometimes brought
in contact. Instead of saying, as we do, that there are endless
mysteries of pain and suffering which our finite minds cannot possibly
understand, they wish to find some quite definite and tangible
solution, therefore they adopt the Buddhistic theory of reincarnation
and karma. We work out, they say, our karma in each succeeding
incarnation for the sins of the last. There is, in their eyes, no such
thing as an innocent victim--with one exception. All suffering, even
that of the veriest babe, is the suffering it has deserved for former
sins.

Oh! A moment she was silent. How about the exception?

The exception, in their eyes, is any great teacher, who, having
fulfilled all his own karma, voluntarily returns to teach and aid those
in a lower state of evolution. You understand that, according to their
theory, a man is bound to return to this earth, whether he will or no,
till his debt of karma has been paid. It is only when that debt is
paid, that the return becomes voluntary; and, when sought, is purely
for the good of mankind.

She looked across the heather.

It would seem, said she reflective, that even that theory makes
something of a call upon faith.

It does, returned John. And yet you must see that it reduces
the mystery of pain to terms capable of being grasped by the human
intelligence. Its the same with every other mystery. Theres the
makeshift in the whole business. On the one hand they allow the
existence of a God presumably infinite; but, on the other hand, they
wish to reduce Him, and His dealings with creation, to terms capable
of understanding by their finite intelligence. But I forgot, strictly
speaking they would not, I suppose, consider their intelligence finite,
since, according to them, there is in every man the potential divinity.

What do they mean? she asked. Are they talking about the soul?

In a sense, yes, returned John. But the soul, apparently, has no
exact individuality of its own; at least, not a lasting individuality.
It is a spark, an atom, of the Great Whole, which when it has developed
to its utmost, and finished all its work, including possible return
in the body to the earth as a teacher, will eventually receive its
reward by becoming merged and absorbed in the Divine Whole from
whence it proceeded. Apparently, also, if a soul refuses to develop,
it can eventually be extinguished, or what is equivalent to being
extinguished.

It doesnt seem exactly a pleasant creed, said she meditative.
Absorption or extinction, as the two final alternatives, are not what
one might term precisely satisfactory to contemplate. It is certainly
nicer to believe that one retains ones individuality.

That, John assured her, is merely our unconquerable egotism.

Then, she retorted smiling, let us hope that it is an egotism your
friend will shortly acquire.

There was a little silence. _Monsieur le Chvre_ had been, for the
moment, forgotten. Certainly his own quiet self-effacement was
conducive to their forgetfulness of him. They were almost at the gate
before she spoke again.

I suppose, she remarked tentatively, your friend is not perverting
you to his theories.

I trust not, said John solemnly. And then he added, I am a Catholic.

Oh! The ejaculation held the tiniest note of pleasure. Then, after a
seconds pause. You know that we have a chapel at the Castle.
