SCENE:
XV

HENRIETTA IN DISGRACE


Darry and Burd seemed to have little time to spend ashore these days.
They said that they had a lot to do to fix up the _Marigold_ for the
proposed trip seaward. But Amy accused them of being afraid of Belle
Ringold and Sally Moon.

"Belle is determined that she shall get an invitation to sail aboard
your yacht, Darry," teased his sister. "Don't forget that."

"Not if we see her first," responded Burd, promptly. "And don't
you ring her in on us, for if you do we'll not let you aboard the
_Marigold_ either. How about it, Darry?"

"Good enough," agreed Amy's brother.

"Oh, I promise not to ring Belle Ringold in on you," giggled Amy.

"It is perfectly disgraceful how you boys teach these girls slang,"
Mrs. Drew remarked with a sigh.

"Why, Mother!" cried Darry, his eyes twinkling, "they teach it to us.
You accuse Burd an me wrongfully. We couldn't tell these girls a single
thing."

This was at breakfast at the Norwood bungalow. After breakfast the
young folks separated. But Jessie and Amy had no complaint to make
about the boys. They had their own interests. This day they had agreed
to explore the island with Nell Stanley as far as the hotel grounds.

They took Henrietta and Sally Stanley along, and carried a picnic
lunch. The older girls were rather curious to see the extent of
"Henrietta's domain," as Amy called it. The pastures included in
the Hackle Island Golf Club grounds covered all the middle of the
island, and consisted of hills and dells, all "up-and-down-dilly," Amy
observed, and from a distance, at least, seemed very attractive.

Of course, they could not go fast with the two smaller girls along,
although Henrietta seemed tireless.

"But Sally ain't a tough one, like me," declared the little girl who
thought she was going to own an island. She approved of Sally Stanley
very much, because the minister's little girl was dainty, and kept her
dresses clean, and was soft-spoken. "I got to run and holler once in a
while or I thinks I'm choking," confessed Henrietta. "But your mamma,
Miss Jessie, says I'll get over that after a while. She says I'll go to
school and learn a lot and that _maybe_ I'll be as nice as Sally some
day."

"I hope you will," said Jessie warmly.

"That's hardly to be expected," Henrietta rejoined in her old-fashioned
way. "Sally was born that way. But I always was a tough one."

"There is a good deal in that," sighed Jessie to the other Roselawn
girls. "The poor little thing! She never did have a chance. But Momsy
is already talking about sending her away to school to have her toned
down and----"

"Suppose the Blairs won't hear to it?" suggested Amy.

"Leave it to Momsy to work things out her way," said Jessie, more gaily.

They soon left the sand dunes behind them and marched up over what the
natives of the island called "the downs" to a scrubby pasture at the
edge of the golf links. Crossing the links watchfully they only had
to dodge a couple of times when the players called "Fore!" and so got
safely past the various greens and reached the patch of wood between
the club premises and the hotel grounds.

There was a spring here which they had been told about, and it was near
enough noon for lunch to occupy an important place in their minds. They
spent an hour here; but after that, much as she had eaten, Henrietta
began to run around again. She could not keep still.

Her voice was suddenly stilled and she halted in the path and stood
like a pointer flushing a covey of birds. The older girls were
surprised. Amy drawled:

"What's the matter, Hen? You don't feel sick, do you?"

"I hear something," declared Henrietta, her freckled face clouding. "I
hear somebody talk that I don't like."

"Who is that?" asked Nell.

"She makes me feel sick, all right," grumbled the little girl.
"Oh, yes! It's her. And if she says again that she owns my island,
I'll--I'll----"
