What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
It aint my gown, the other wept. It aint _just_ my gown! Its--O
God Almighty! _Its everything!_

I know! I know! Julie cried poignantly. Youre sick. I understand.

Im crazy. Im all in a kind of a daze. The old woman wept
convulsively. O God, whats the matter with me? I cant seem to find
myself.

She looked up at Julie, her mouth tremulous and her old eyes filmed
with despairing tears.

I cant find myself, I--I blieve Im crazy, she repeated
desperately. I cant fix up no more. I aint got no heart left for
nothing. She turned her head dumbly from side to side. I know
everythings dirty: its all in a mess. But I cant fix up no more.

Youre tired.

Tired! Im so tired I wisht I was dead, the other cried.

I know; I understand, Julies tender hand still caressed her. But
Ive come to help you. Im your friend. Ill fix everything up for
you, an then you wont feel so bad. Look at the flowers I brought
you.

She held the gay, alluring little nosegay out. The old woman took her
clinched hands down from her face, and stared dimly at it. Her cheeks
were smudged with tears, and she swallowed convulsively, like a child
when its storm of grief is past.

See, Julie went on, her compassionate voice soothing her. See,
honey, I got them in market for you this morning. Look how nice an
fresh they are.

The flowers with their blue blossoms peeping through the netted
greenery, like faces looking through latticed windows, seemed a
lodestone to draw the old creatures attention away from her despair.
She put out one trembling finger and touched them uncertainly, and
although she did not speak, she let her gaze linger upon them.

Where shall I set them? Julie questioned, now for the first time
daring to raise her eyes and look about the unhappy room. The whole
place was in disorder. Dust lay everywhere; clothes were upon the
floor and tumbled on chairs; the window was dim and smudged with dirt;
a sick canary bird drooped in its cage, and a geranium plant was
withered and dead in the window. The life had gone out of every small
attempt at homemaking. The curtains, which had once been clean and
festive, were soiled and torn now, and the white covers upon the bureau
were crumpled. The spirit in the old woman which should have informed
her dwelling place with life and cheer was as withered at its roots
as the geranium in the window. There was just one thing which caught
Julies eye amid all the squalor. That was the photograph of a young
girl on the mantel shelf. Unlike the rest, it was dusted and cared for.
The frame was bright and the glass clean. It appeared to stand as the
last pinnacle of hope, over which the despair that had engulfed the
rest of the room had not as yet surged.

Where shall I put the flowers? Julie questioned again, and the
old woman raised her eyes and pointed to the picture. There, she
commanded.

Julie stepped across and placed the nosegay before the picture. It was
that of a young girl, dressed in a fashion of some fifteen years ago.

What a pretty little girl, she said. Who is she?

Old Miss Fogg stared at the picture through dim eyes. My little baby
child--all I got in the world, she muttered at length and broke into
fresh tears. Shes all the kin I got in the world, but shes married
an gone, and I aint seen her for ten years, she wept. Oh, my baby,
my honey! Why dont you come see your old Tannie no more? O Sweetness,
I want to see you so bad!

You havent seen her for ten years! Julie exclaimed. Instantly she
saw the thin old shoulders stiffen, and felt an unseen veil drawn. Miss
Fogg looked up in quick defiance, a crafty challenge in her eyes.

Who said she aint been to see me for ten years? she demanded.

Why you said-- Julie faltered.

I aint said _nothing_! the other stormed. Folks tells lies. I dont
know whats got into people. They aint got no idea about the truth
no more. What business they got telling tales about my little honey,
saying she aint coming to see me no more? They dont know, she spoke
mysteriously, but Im expecting her most any day now. Shell come to
me soon, my babyll come soon to her old Tannie. Her tone changed, she
looked up at Julie, and spoke with a pathetic dignity, Im looking for
a visit from my little niece, she said. I wouldnt be surprised if
she was to come to-day.
