SCENE:
It was nearly midnight, and the battleship _Argyll_, stripped to bare
steel, was drifting with banked fires but a full head of steam, waiting
for daybreak to discover the enemy. New things were expected in this
coming action. Wireless news had told of the presence of submarines, as
yet unproved in war, and before the going down of the sun a high-power
telescope on board had brought to view two small moving spots in the
distant sky--airships; but whether they were friends or enemies had not
been determined. No hammocks were piped that night--men slept at their
stations or remained awake and talked; and aft on the superstructure
a group of officers off duty discussed the possibilities of future
warfare, and the coming place of the battleship under the menace
of the bomb-dropping dirigible balloon and the invisible submarine
with its deadly torpedo. All had taken part, some with laughter and
joking, others with the earnest conviction of serious thought, and the
discussion finally had narrowed down to a wordy combat between the
highest and the lowest of the commissioned officers, Mr. Clarkson,
the executive officer, and young Mr. Felton, temporarily the torpedo
lieutenant. Mr. Felton had become dogmatic in his assertions, which is
excusable at sea only in the young.

"But, Mr. Felton," said the executive officer, slowly and earnestly,
"have a little common sense. Can't you see that conditions must change,
that the battleship, like the steamship, has almost reached the limit
of size and development, while the airship and the submarine are in
their infancy?"

"But there must be a center, a nucleus of the fleet. How can you
preserve the line of battle without such a backbone? Where will you put
the admiral?"

"Up in the air, where he can see things?"

"And be seen, too, and shot at."

"Felton, an ordinary gas bag can travel faster than the speediest
water craft ever constructed. We cannot hit a destroyer at full speed.
How can we hit an airship above us? Gun sights are useless at such
elevations, even though guns could be pointed."

"All a matter of mathematics. Design new ones."

"And suppose a few bombs come down on deck, or down the funnels;
what'll happen to the boilers?"

"Armor the deck, and do away with funnels. We will soon have internal
combustion engines, anyhow."

"And for submarine attack? Armor the bottom, too? Felton, a battleship
will cease to be a battleship. With that weight of armor she could only
carry the guns of a cruiser without a cruiser's speed."

"But she would still hold the line of battle."

"Until she was further reduced. Then she would not be even a cruiser.
Finally she would sacrifice some of her armor--side armor, we'll say,
because unnecessary--then, with enemies only above and below, she would
lose it all, seal up and dive, or take wings and fly."

"Oh, Mr. Clarkson," said Felton, wearily, "you are a visionary and
theorist. The battleship is here, a perfected fighting machine."

"But she cannot grow much better, while the flying machine and the
submarine have just begun. Imagine the three types starting together.
Which would be chosen?"

"It would depend upon the judgment, experience, and gray matter of the
choosers. I"--young Mr. Felton threw out his chest--"would choose the
battleship."

"Because you never hit one. There goes eight bells. Turn in, Felton,
and sleep it off."

Amid the laughter--for Mr. Felton, as torpedo officer, had not yet
scored a hit in his department--of the listening officers, the group
dispersed, to stand watch, or sleep, until four hours later, when the
striking of eight bells would again bring a change on the watches. It
was Felton's turn in, and he went to his berth; but, hot and excited
over the discussion, he remained awake, tossing and rolling, and
mentally arguing with the impractical "first luff," until one bell had
struck, then two, and finally three. Then he dozed off, and was sound
asleep when the familiar stroke of the bell again rang in his ears.
"Clang-clang, clang-clang."

"Only four bells," he murmured, sinking back for another two hours of
sleep. But he had hardly lost consciousness when the gun-room orderly
tapped at his door.

"Going into action, sir," he said. "You were called, and I thought you
had wakened. All hands are at stations, sir."
