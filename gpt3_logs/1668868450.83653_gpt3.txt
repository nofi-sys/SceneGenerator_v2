SCENE:
Rob took a step towards him so that the light streamed down upon his
features.

"Humph!" grunted Murdoch, cocking his eyes at the gipsy, "it is queer
company ye're taken up with, my man.  Do ye ken who that is with his
innocent face and braw blue eyes?  That's the lad of Muckle John."

"Whist!" warned Gloom, "the very rocks have ears."

At that moment a little girl came running over the courtyard.

"What did ye say of Muckle John?" she asked.

"Gang to your bed, Ethlenn," screamed the old man.  "Janet, away with
the bairn."

A woman ran out into the twilight.  There was a noise of sudden
crying and a door banged.

"Can we bide the night here?" asked the gipsy, but with poor enough
heart in it.

"Bide the night," echoed Murdoch sharply, "bide the night in company
with yon?  Can ye--by the dogs of Lorn I think ye're crazed.  What
have I ever done to ye that ye should mak' me sic a daft-like
proposal?"

"It is no use, Rob," said Gloom sadly.

With a kind of horror at his own notoriety Rob turned away and passed
down the slope.  He heard the voice of Murdoch raised in shrill anger
and falling into nothingness on the wind.  Behind him trooped the
gipsies, uncomplaining but dispirited, streaming towards Strathyre.

And so passing through the sleeping village they reached the narrow
defile at the head of Loch Lubnaig, and ascending the hillside passed
a dreary night.

It was just before the dawn of the next day that Rob came to a
decision, which appeared to him the only wise and honest thing to do.
He wrote a brief note to Gloom thanking him for his great kindness,
and stating that he would be far towards the south by the morning.

Then stepping between the gipsies' sleeping forms he came down upon
the loch and set off at a trot for Kilmahog.


Many days afterwards--days full to the brim of danger and heavy
travelling, Rob reached Edinburgh and wandered about the High Street.
He had managed to purchase another set of clothes, and for the
present he deemed himself safe, and on the morrow he would keep his
tryst with Muckle John at Leith.

It was about midday that he saw a great coach lumbering over the rude
cobbles jolting and groaning, and about it a party of dragoons.  A
sudden fear gripped him that perchance this was a prisoner, who
knew--perhaps Muckle John himself.

He pushed his way to the front of the crowd.  Nearer clattered the
dragoons, a braver sight than when they had entered that same street
in the year '45.  The horses straining at the coach were level with
him now, and he bent forward, his eyes glued to the window.  It was
but a flash, but he never forgot it.

For lolling forward, leering grotesquely either in derision or some
kindred emotion, sat Simon, Lord Lovat, bound for London and Tower
Hill.

His small shrewd eyes travelling over the crowd settled for an
instant upon Rob, and contracted suddenly as though he half
recollected him, but was not sure.  Then he was gone, and that was
the last of the Fraser.

The scene sobered what little foolhardiness there was left in Rob.
It made him walk less abroad.  The arm of the law was long, but the
arm of the Government was longer.

More than once he had a curious intuition on that afternoon that he
was being followed.  It might be only an accident, but he had run
into two slouching frowsy rascals on two separate occasions, and each
time they had stared very hard and looked back at him over their
shoulders.

At last overcome by fear of capture he had taken to his heels and run
up one close and down another, being quite unfamiliar with the City,
but only anxious to shake off any shadowing.  After he had doubled
and dodged for a full half-hour he took cover upon an ancient
stairway beside the White Horse Inn, and there he waited to see what
would happen and whether there were really any upon his trail.  It
was about five minutes later that the noise of a man panting up the
lane set him keeking down to see who came so hastily.  To his dismay
it was one of the loafers of the afternoon, and hard on his heels the
other.  They passed at a run and their footsteps died away.
