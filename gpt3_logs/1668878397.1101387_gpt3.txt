SCENE:
All right, boys! Roy exclaimed. In she goes--ho! Teddy, take the
front! Grab this paddle! Ill stay in the stern! Bug Eye, you and
Pop keep those rifles loaded--we may need em!

The canoe was in the water now, and swung about madly. The current
was stronger than they had imagined.

With luck, well catch up to them soon! Teddy panted. If we can
get close enough before they know were comin--

Roy did not reply, needing all his energy to keep the boat straight.
The larger craft received the full force of the stream, and also it
was much less heavily weighted than it had been.

Want me to-- Bug Eye began. But when he saw, by the moonlight, the
lines of intense effort in Roys face he stopped. This was no time
for talk.

Can you--hear em? Teddy gasped, digging his paddle in deeper.

Nope! Pop answered laconically. He, alone, seemed to accept the
situation calmly, staring straight ahead as he sat rigidly in the
bottom of the canoe. Perhaps he feared the chase would be futile, or
perhaps he realized that their best chance of success lay in going
about the affair in a businesslike manner. His rifle, loaded, lay
across his knees.

As the canoe shot downstream, Teddy, in the front, strained his ears
for some indication of the boat they were following. But it seemed
to have been swallowed up by the river. Surely they were going much
faster than the other craft and should have caught them by this
time. Unless--and Teddy frowned at the thought--unless they knew
they were being pursued and made for the shore, pulling their
lighter boat up out of sight.

Now the river seemed to take their canoe in a powerful grip and
shake it. Roy paddled desperately, and succeeded in steadying it.

Close! he gasped. Thought we were over then!

If I had my Fishmobile-- Bug Eye muttered, then closed his mouth
tightly. The shore seemed far away at this moment.

Better head in, Pop suggested quietly. Afraid they got away,
boys. I dont like the sound of this river.

Hate to give up, Roy responded, but even he was beginning to see
the wisdom of Pops advice. Somehow, the roar of the stream seemed
to have increased in volume. Whether it was because the banks were
closer together here, thus adding to the force of the current, the
boys could not tell. At all events, both Teddy and Roy decided that
they had best attempt to land.

Take the left side for a minute, Roy called. The sweat was running
off the paddlers in small rivulets and their breaths were coming in
short gasps. Well have to--get together. With me, now!
Ho--ho--ho--ho-- Slowly the craft turned her nose to the bank. The
shoreline was barely distinguishable, and the boys had no means of
estimating their speed. But they knew that they were going fast
enough to sink, surely, if they hit anything.

Make it? Bug Eye asked anxiously. He was holding on to the sides
of the boat with both hands, his rifle, forgotten now, lying in the
bottom. Indeed, all thought of their quarry had vanished from the
minds of both Teddy and Roy. All they knew was that they were out in
the middle of a river which was trying its best to whirl them onward
to destruction.

Even Pop Burns was startled out of his complacency. He turned and
looked sharply at Roy.

Mebby--mebby not, he said enigmatically, and began to peel off his
vest. Yore gettin near, though. A little more, boys. Id help if
I could, but if I tried to shift wed go over sure.

Stick--to it, Teddy panted. Roy, you take the left--were gaining
now--shes swingin closer--

Teddy had a wild idea that if they came near enough, he could tumble
overboard and swim with the canoe to land. But he dismissed the
thought as soon as it came to him, for the craft was much too heavy
for any such plan as that to work. Besides, there were huge, sharp
rocks along here, and if his head struck one he would be lost.

Got--to stick--to the ship, the boy murmured, as he strained at
the paddle.

Suddenly Roy gave a yell. The boat lurched, and swung about in a
circle.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The boys are in a canoe, chasing after another boat. The river is strong and they are having trouble keeping up. They decide to turn back, but the river is even stronger and they are having trouble steering. Suddenly, the canoe tips over and they are thrown into the water.
