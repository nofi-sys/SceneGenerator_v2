SCENE:
A bit fallen angel; I dont think: what? she said.

A man with a mahogany-coloured face, rather like a frog, Hi thought,
since his eyes turned up and his face was all going to throat, began to
sing a doleful ballad, with a chorus in which all joined. As all felt
better after this, one of the other men sang a song which went with
great spirit, though it made the ladies blush. As he was pleased with
its reception, he sang all the blushing parts of it a second time. Then
the frog man produced a bag from under the seat: it contained three
small bottles with brightly coloured labels showing ladies of a free
disposition. The labels were printed with the words: Smiles of the
Muses. There was much applause in the brake when they appeared.

Ha. Smiles of the Muses. Three bottles.

Ha, the good Hernando, who knows what is good.

Always the good Smiles of the Muses, to drive away care and settle what
went before.

The brake pulled up by the wayside, so that no Smile might be spilled.
The good Hernando dispensed something like a quarter of a bottle to each
of the company. It was a syrup or cordial, about as thick as olive oil.
It smelt, when opened, of all the flowers of heaven. At a first taste it
reminded one of strawberries and of honey: then it warmed the throat:
then, as it trickled along, it made a feeling glow all the way down.

When the brake drove on again, the mandoline struck up a Smile of the
Muse: the reed-pipe piped to it and the company sang. The song had not
much body to it, being indeed a catch about the eyes of a lady being as
lovely as stars. It went on, during some miles of the way, till in the
dusk of the evening the brake halted in San Marco, which was a town of
six farms and a chapel.

Here, as weary as Hi was, he noticed that something had happened:
someone had come in with news which brought all the town out of doors.
When the news reached the wedding party, it changed their tone. The
younger men hurried off to the group about the messenger, who stood on
the chapel steps answering questions. The frog-faced man, the good
Hernando, helped Hi down from the brake. Uncle Philip and the girl urged
him to enter a lime-washed farm-house, with a smell of wine-press about
it near which the brake had stopped. Hi was so dizzy with fatigue that
he hardly knew what he was doing, yet he shrank from bringing his filthy
state into a clean home.

You come to the harness-room, Uncle Philip said, through the girl,
for a bath, and to get out the thorns and jiggers.

They brought him a half-cask and hot water: after his bathe they gave
him a clean cotton sleeping suit and a bed with Christian sheets. They
brought broth to him, when he was in bed, but he was asleep before it
came: he slept for fifteen hours.

In the afternoon of the next day, when he woke, he found his clothes
washed and mended. Uncle Philip and the girl brought him a coat, a
sombrero and a pair of new shoes, which they pressed him to accept with
a grace and sweetness of welcome which moved him almost to tears.
Guests come from God, they said.

Hosts, too, he thought.

If I ever can, he said, I will bring these things back: be sure. I
can never, never thank you enough.

When he had dressed, he came to the girl.

What has happened? he asked. Ive been lost for a week. What has
happened in the country?

There is war, she said.

In Santa Barbara city?

We do not hear of the city, save once in the week, when the ore-train
returns with the empty trucks. No; but one from the west came here
yesterday to call us to war. There are thousands, he said, marching to
Santa Barbara.

What for?

For our religion, so he said.

Is that Don Manuel? Hi asked. Is it Don Manuels army that is
marching?

I do not know. It will be some army.

Where it is? Hi asked. Do you happen to know where it is?

It was near here, within a short ride, yesterday, she said, going to
Anselmo, the place you asked about.
