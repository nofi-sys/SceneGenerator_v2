SCENE:
It was ten oclock. The floor of the ballroom shone with wax;
the rows of chairs upon three sides were filled with chattering
couples; Levi and his musicians stood ready. All were waiting for
Master-of-Ceremonies Murphy, to give the word.

The floor looks great, remarked that gentleman. He was surrounded
by the floor committee at the far end of the room, and was running
his eye over everything like a general before going into battle. There
would be no hitch if he could help it. He hummed a tune and went
through a few steps of a glide waltz by way of a test.

Like old cheese, commented he, jist as slippy as ice. He looked
about him, again. Wheres McGonagle? he inquired. Oh, there youse
are, seeing that gentleman. All ready?

Sure, responded Goose, its up to youse to say when.

Larry took some half dozen steps out upon the floor; then he paused,
rapped sharply with his heel, and drew himself up with a dignity
that Professor Whalen could not have excelled. All eyes were upon
him; he extended both arms, palms held downward, waving them up and
down. Silence fell. The palms came together with a sharp report; Levi
described a wild flourish with his bow; the cornet blared brassily;
McGonagle and Annie Clancy stepped out upon the floor to lead the
march. The ball was on.

At midnight the affair was in full blast; quadrille, schottische and
waltz succeeded each other with hardly a pause, the dancers whirled,
stamped and pirouetted with exhaustless energy; the musicians blew and
scraped, the perspiration dropping from their faces. A sergeant of
police, on his round of inspection, had just dropped in; he stood in
the doorway leading to the staircase looking wet and chilled, for it
had begun to rain, and talked to the men on duty in the hall.

Anything doing? asked he, shaking the drops of water from the brim of
his hat, his eyes taking in the heaving mass on the floor, swaying in
rhythm with the music.

Ony a couple o drunks, answered the pock-marked officer; an we
just fired em out, not botherin to pull up for the wagon.

I seen Daily and some o that crowd, in the barroom, said another.
From the way things look hes cappin for Kelly, and Kellys dealin
out the dough for further orders.

For drinks, eh? The sergeant frowned. Say Laughlin, go in there and
tell Kelly I want to see him, right away. The damn fool oughtnt make
work for me!

Kelly had a roll of notes in his hand and was flourishing them
animatedly over his head; a crowd of half drunken youths surged about
him, approvingly; he was their idol, having usurped the post held an
hour before by Shaffer, the collector for the brewery.

This is the stuff that makes the world move! declared the
saloonkeeper. Were all after it, me buckos, ivery wan av us an
small blame till him that puts the fattest wad in the bank, eh?

Yer dead right, Kel, agreed a supporter.

Barkeeper, remarked Kelly after a glance about, me friends here are
doin nawthin. He stripped a note from the bundle and threw it upon
the sloppy bar. Work that out, requested he, an tell me when its
done. Theres more to folly, for Im out for a good toime the noight.

Theres a good ting! exclaimed Nobby Foley. Hes a blood, dye
hear--a blood! He treats youse right, see?

Gintlemen, affirmed the object of these remarks, I havent a mane
bone in me body, an the man that do be after callin James Kelly
a friend, is welcome till share his last dollar. Iv any av yez gits
pinched does yez friends have till ax me twice till go yez bail? Be
hivens! excitedly, there aint a magistrate in the city, Raypublican
or Dimmycrat, thated kape yez in the jug a minyute after I wint
forninst him and told him till lave ye go.

The enthusiasm that greeted this statement shook the walls. Daily,
Foley, and a select circle of kindred spirits added no little volume to
it. They rapturously patted the speaker on the back and beat the bar
with their glasses, for each had a five dollar note tucked snugly away
in his pocket and felt in duty bound to stir up the promised amount of
enthusiasm. The outburst elated the selectman; his voice was husky with
drink, but he climbed upon a chair and plunged into a speech.

The fellys that are again me, declared he, say that I am not
a Dimmycrat, an would have yez vote to bate me. But whin the day
comes Ill show thim what the people of the ward tink, because the
dillygatesll be there thatll name me in spoite av thim!

He forgot his protestation of a few minutes before that he was out for
a good time, and proceeded to make a bid for his hearers support at
the primaries; Daily and his henchmen were punctuating his remarks by
salvos of applause, when Laughlin summoned the orator into the entry.
