SCENE:
What is it? she exclaimed wildly, as she tossed back her hair. What
do these cruel people want to do to me now?

The doctor, who saw at a glance the meaning of what was going on below,
and the necessity of keeping his patient cool, turned to her, with a
very quiet expression

Do not be alarmed, madam. It is merely some disorderly gathering of
rowdies, in the street below. There is no danger to youonly do not get
excited, or you will bleed again. I am here to protect you.

Then I am safe! was the fervid response, which, however, was followed
by a roar so sullen and portentous, from the infuriated mob underneath,
as to leave some doubt of its truth even upon the mind of the doctor.

Down with the amalgamation den!

Down with the saw-dust palace!

Tear it down!

Lets lynch the wretches!

The response to speeches of this sort, from single voices, would be a
simultaneous burst of approbation from the great crowd, and a trampling
and rush to get nearer the building. It seemed a formidable sight,
indeed, to the doctor, as he looked down upon this living mass of men,
surging like huge waves tossed against some cliff, while the torches,
that many of them bore, glared fitfully upon the upturned, angry faces.

A powerful voice, which rose above all the tumult, exclaimed with a
hoarse oath, as the speaker turned for an instant towards the crowd,
from the top of the front steps

Let us burst open the door and lynch every white person found with a
negro. Here goes for the door! and he threw himself furiously against
it, while a perfect thunder-crash of roars attested the approbation of
the dangerous mob. The door resisted for a moment, when there was a
sudden yell from the outside of the mob, nearly a square distant

Here! heres whatll do it! pass em on! and the alarmed doctor saw
immediately the portentous gleam of fire-axes, which were being passed
over the heads of the crowd towards the door, and in another instant
the crash of the cutting would commence. The doctor, as we have seen,
was a very prompt man. He thrust his head out of the window, and in a
loud, commanding voice, shouted

Stop!

The man at the door, who had just received the axe, and was in the act
of wielding it, paused for an instant, to look up, while the whole sea
of faces was raised toward the window, amidst a moments silence, of
which the doctor instantly availed himself

Gentlemen, do you war upon women? I have a female patient here, in
this room, at the point of death! If you proceed, you will kill her!

Who is she? shouted some one, while another voice, in a derisive
tone, yelled out amidst screams of laughter

Is she Rose? Rose? de coal-brack Rose? I wish I may be shot if I dont
lub Rose!

Amidst the thunders which followed, some one shouted from a distant
part of the mob, to the man with the axe

Go on, Jim! Its all pretence with their sick women!

Down with the doorthey dont escape us that way! Look out for your
bones, old covey, when we catch you!

The axe was again swung back, but the doughty doctor still persisted

Stop! he shouted again, in a tone so startling for energy of command,
that the axe was again lowered.

Are you Americans? Have you mothers and sisters?

Yes, but they aint black gals! gibed one of the mob, and set the
rest into a roar once again.

I appeal to you as menas brothers and fathers, do not murder my poor
patient!

Who is that noisy fellow? bellowed a brutal voice below.

I am a physician! I have nothing to do with this house or its
principles; I only beg to be permitted to save my patient!

What is your name, I say? bellowed the hoarse man again. Out with
it! Well know yousome of us!
