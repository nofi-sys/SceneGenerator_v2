Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
All this was well known to the gathering in the town house. In the
midst of their own troubles, the people of Eastham deeply sympathized
with their less fortunate compatriots of Provincetown.

As the discussion continued, various schemes for getting into
communication with the prisoners were proposed and rejected. Some
were for boldly going to the Spencer and having the matter out with
Raggett. The wiser heads opposed this. What was the use of running the
risk of being added to the list of prisoners? There was nothing to
prevent Raggett from holding the envoys and demanding ransom for their
release.

I think thats a sensible view to take of it, Mr. Chairman, said
Peter Walker. For my part, Im very sure that Hoppy Mayos brain is
hard at work trying to devise means to outwit the British. You surely
dont imagine that Hoppys nimble wit has failed him all of a sudden?
Any man who succeeded in disposing of a spavined mare as a sound horse,
and that to a minister of the Gospel, sleeps with one eye open when
hes in the hands of the enemy!

The Rev. Philander Shaw, minister of the Congregational church, had, a
few minutes previously, joined the meeting, and as he was the victim
of Hoppys horse-trade, there was loud laughter at Peters remark. The
genial minister joined in the merriment and when it subsided, remarked
goodhumoredly:

Im afraid, Mr. Chairman, Master Walker thinks as little of my
judgment of horseflesh as he does of my preaching.

This was a gentle thrust at Peters irregular attendance at church.
Indeed, it was general knowledge that Master Walker had written some
verses sarcastically insinuating that the ministers of the period were
in no way the equals of the great men whose cure of souls had been the
glory of ancient Eastham.

There was renewed laughter, this time at the expense of the redoubtable
Peter.

Master Walker will have his joke, reverend sir, said Squire Harding
Knowles with mock severity, but we sadly want someone to enliven us at
present.

No offence, Squire Knowles, replied the minister heartily; no
offence at all. With all his joking, it seems to me that Master Walker
has given us a hint of great value in our present dilemma. Until we
devise some means of communicating with our imprisoned neighbors, I
think we may assume that they are not idle on their own behalf. Perhaps
we had better wait yet awhile for tidings.

I agree with Mr. Shaw, said Captain Heman Smith. It seems natural to
think that if Captain Raggett wants a ransom he must send word ashore
to the prisoners friends.

Aye, thats the logical way of looking at it, assented the chairman.
They certainly cannot be ransomed with whatever property Captain
Raggett has already taken from them. The whaleboat and cargo are in his
possession, but it seems he does not consider them as other than the
spoils of war. We should hear from him soon unless he intends to hold
our neighbors for some other purpose.

His intention may be to add them to his own crew, said Selectman
Freeman. This practice is common with the British when they capture an
American vessel, and it goes hard with the American seaman who refuses
to obey; I have heard of flogging and other cruel punishments being
inflicted on such unfortunates.

Hoppy Mayo and Win Knowles will never turn traitors to their own
flag, asserted Peter Walker.

This was greeted with approval. That either of the prisoners should
fight against his country, no matter what the penalty of refusal might
be, was not to be thought of by any Eastham man.

Dont see what he wants them for, then, cried Obed Sparrow. He has
idle men enough on his hands already. Why, theres nothing for his crew
to do now as there are no boats running since the whaleboat was taken.

Well, Neighbor Sparrow, thats very true; but if Captain Raggett
is holding our friends for any ulterior purpose, we should very much
like to know what that purpose is. How we are going to find out is the
puzzle. As the chairman said this he looked around the hall as if
seeking enlightenment.

But there was none forthcoming. Every avenue through which information
could be obtained seemed closed, and the hopelessness of further effort
was apparent to all. The discussion lagged and the people were on the
point of dispersing when the strains of a fife were heard. The musician
was still at a considerable distance from the town house, but Master
Peter Walker had heard the tune before, so he said:


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene is a meeting of the townspeople of Eastham, who are discussing ways to rescue their compatriots who have been captured by the British and imprisoned in Provincetown. Various schemes are proposed and rejected, and the discussion is becoming increasingly hopeless when the strains of a fife are heard.
Master Peter Walker recognizes the tune as one that he has heard before, and he says that it is Hoppy Mayo, one of the prisoners, coming to rescue them. The townspeople are initially skeptical, but they are soon convinced when Mayo and his companion, Win Knowles, come into view.
Mayo and Knowles tell the townspeople that they escaped by digging a tunnel under the prison wall and then following a stream to the sea. They warn the townspeople that Captain Raggett is planning to attack Eastham, and they offer to help defend the town.
The townspeople are overjoyed at the escape of the prisoners and the news that they will be able to defend their town. They make preparations for the attack, and when Captain Raggett and his men arrive, they are met with a hail of bullets and are forced to retreat.
