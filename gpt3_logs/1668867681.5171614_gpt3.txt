SCENE:
Huh! what does that matter to us? Ballyhoo chuckled, when we can
drop out of all the rush, and lie at the bottom as snug as you please,
waiting for the waves to quiet down, and the winds to cease? I tell you
these tubs may not be very comfortable in a whole lot of ways; but when
it comes to dodging trouble in the shape of storms theyve got a hunch
on everything going, believe me.

Lest the enemy might think to keep a lookout so as to report their
course, skipper was taking a false tack. Later on this could be easily
remedied, and the lost time made up.

An hour afterwards the little Key was almost out of sight, even with
the glass, for with the rising of the clouds, and the freshening
breeze, there had come a slight mist in the air that rendered seeing
difficult.

Good-bye to Coco Key, then, Ballyhoo had said, waving his hand toward
the distant northwest where the island lay. And I warrant you those
chaps are the busy lot right now, sending a diver down, and holding
their breath until he comes up again to report nothing doing. But say,
its getting beyond a joke out here. Youve got to hold tight unless
you want to be tossed overboard. I move we go below, boys, and settle
down; any old time now the skipper will be giving orders to close the
hatch, because were meaning to dip under.

It happened that they received notice to leave the hurricane deck
before Ballyhoos advice could be acted on. And the last glimpse they
had of the ocean things were certainly looking pretty stormy.

Then followed the customary sounds that told they were taking on
water ballast, and sinking fast. After that the rocking, sickening
motion gradually ceased until they were moving on an even keel, with
everything steady around them.

As usual the boys, not being able to move around much, sought their
bunks, to lie there and doze, or else converse on the many subjects
that were of interest to them. Oscar wandered off at one time, there
being something he wished to see in connection with the working of the
submarine at such a time as this.

Jack, upon finding that nothing could be discovered through an
observation bulls-eye, when he opened the stout shutter, save a
surging mass of green water rushing past, realized that picture
taking would not pay him just then. Besides, he began to fear that he
would make too great inroads on his stock of reserve films unless he
exercised considerable caution, so he determined to bide his time, as
there were undoubtedly wonderful things yet in store for him.

Hours crept by.

The tired divers no doubt welcomed this opportunity to recuperate after
their recent strenuous employment. Captain Shooks, too, must have spent
much of this time in his bunk, for the boys saw nothing of him; though
he may have been up in the conning tower several times for aught they
knew, advising the man at the wheel, or taking an observation by means
of the periscope as to the condition of the weather above.

When the three chums were beginning to feel dreadfully tired of being
shut in such cramped quarters, and with poor air to breathe at that,
Ballyhoo made the pleasing discovery that the electric pumps were busy
again.

Were going to the surface, boys! he told the others gleefully. Oh!
how Im longing for a lungful of that salty air. I never knew how
glorious pure air could be until I first spent three hours cooped up in
an undersea boat. Why, right now I can taste oil and gas to beat the
band. This sort of travel may be novel enough, but it isnt all its
cracked up to be, by a jugfull.

Presently they knew they were drawing near the surface on account of
the renewal of that pitching motion. Captain Shooks, however, must have
figured that it would be perfectly safe for them to emerge, for the
pumps continued to work, and in the end through the bulls-eyes they
could catch occasional glimpses of daylight, though, as a rule, surging
water blinded their view.

When this had continued for perhaps an hour they felt a sudden relief,
showing that the hatch above the conning tower must have been opened to
allow fresh air to circulate through the boat. The ventilators, too,
were in use again, and conditions seemed vastly improved.

Being allowed to climb aloft later on, the boys saw nothing around them
in any direction but a tumbling sea, with foam-crested billows. It was
surely an inspiring sight, especially when seen from the deck of a low
craft like a submarine, that lay on the heaving waters like a duck.

Jack, unable to resist the temptation to immortalize that picture,
managed to get his camera on deck, and, with the help of both his
comrades, work off part of a film that would give them great delight
in some of the days to come, when they were once more safely back in
quiet, sedate little old Melancton.
