SCENE:
Tophams face flushed. You cannot tell an officer of the United States
Navy to go to hell without consequences. Fortunately the young fellow
was not impulsive. Easy, Mr. Quentin, he cautioned. Warn him once
more.

For the last time, heave to, you damned pirate, shouted Quentin.
Heave to! or Ill fire into you.

Back came the answer. Fire if you dare!

Quentin lowered the megaphone. His eyes glittered and his breast
swelled with unholy joy. Its up to us, he suggested.

Send a shot between his masts, ordered Topham. It may bring him to
his senses.

Crack. The spiteful snap of the aft six-pounder thrilled through
the night, and Topham saw the men on the yacht duck as the projectile
whistled about their heads.

The next instant Ouro Pretos voice, crazy with rage rose. Fire!
Fire! he yelled.

But the yachtsmen did not fire. Ready as most of them were to take the
risks of battle with the Brazilian government, they were not ready to
fire upon a United States ship. Small though it might be, it carried
the power and dignity of the nation.

They did not fire, but still the yacht swept on. Ill put the next
shot through your pilot house, megaphoned Quentin. Be warned! Train
on the pilot house, he ordered, in tones loud enough to reach the
yacht.

Ay! Ay! Sir! The gunners bent to their piece, but before they could
fire the door of the pilot house of the Seabird flew open and a man,
ducking low, ran out. Instantly the yacht, uncontrolled, swung off into
the trough of the waves.

You damned cowards! Ouro Pretos voice was unintelligible with rage.
He snatched up a rifle and flung it to his shoulder, but some one
knocked up his arm and the bullet whistled harmlessly over Tophams
head.

As the sound lost itself in the immensity of the ocean, Quentins voice
sounded. Heave to! he ordered, calmly.

The clang of the engine bells answered and the yacht lost way.
Instantly the Watson followed suit, sheering inward as she did so.
Closer they came and closer until the Watson poked her sharp nose under
the yachts overhanging counter, and Topham caught the trailing Jacob
ladder and swarmed over the rail and dropped upon her deck.

Ouro Preto faced him. What does this--this piracy mean? he demanded.

Topham took no notice of the words. He could afford to ignore them.
Besides Ouro Preto was her brother. Politely he saluted.

I am instructed by the President of the United States to bring him the
young lady whom you kidnapped tonight. Kindly produce her!

I wont do it.

Topham shrugged his shoulders. Then I shall be compelled to take you
into port as a pirate, he said, distinctly.

Ouro Preto shook with the fury that possessed him. The hopes of years
were crumbling before his eyes.

You have no right, he clamored. No right. This is a German vessel--

Your pardon. She was once a Brazilian ship, but she has forfeited her
rights by engaging in rebellion against Brazil. She is now an outlaw if
not a pirate. Give up the girl and do not force me to take the vessel
of a former friend into port as a prize.

Ouro Preto glared for a moment. But before he could utter the defiance
that was on the end of his tongue, a feminine voice broke in.

Good-evening, Mr. Topham! it said, sweetly. Youve come in good
time. Lillian Byrd stood smilingly by, with Rutile beside her. As all
eyes were turned on her. She went on. Mr. Rutile let me out of the
stateroom where the count had locked me. You didnt know Mr. Rutile was
on board, did you, Count?

Helplessly Ouro Preto stared from one to the other. Rutile! he
gasped. You here?

Rutile nodded. Sure thing, he remarked, genially. Been on board for
three weeks. Wireless operator, you know. Sorry, but the games up, old
man. It is, really!
