Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
The big man shrugged:

Camp in the village on the mainland--they certainly cant come on the
island. Weve special instructions about it--no one but the company
to be allowed there till the performance. Did she speak to you about
that?

No, she hardly ever alludes to the subject. But they _would_ keep a
watch on her, wouldnt they?

He nodded, frowning a little at a complication new in his experience:

I should think so--a woman in her position. Men under sentence of
death have been unable to keep away from the girl they were in love
with. And then she may know where he is, be in communication with him.

Oh, I dont think that, Anne breathed in alarm. Shed never take
such a risk.

Well, were her friends and were as much in the dark as anybody. I
only know one thing--if they try to hound her down on that island--the
first chance shes had to recuperate and rest--Ill--

A slight grating noise came from the hall. Anne held up a quick
cautioning hand.

Take care, she murmured. Heres Joe.

Joe came in, his Panama hat low on his brow. He gave no sign of
greeting till he saw Bassett, then he emitted an abrupt Hello and
snatched off the hat:

Little Annes got a caller. Howdy, Bassett! Hows things?

There was a jovial note in his voice, a wide grin of greeting on his
face. It was evident the sight of Bassett pleased him, and he stood
teetering back and forth on his toes and heels, looking ingratiatingly
at the visitor. He was like Anne, the same delicate features, the same
long eyebrows and the same trick of raising them till they curved high
on his forehead. But his face had an elfish, almost malign quality
lacking in hers, and the brown eyes, brilliant and hard, were set too
close to his nose. He was two years younger than she--twenty-two--but
looked older, immeasurably older, in the baser worldly knowledge which
had already set its stamp upon him.

He launched forth with a suggestion of pouncing eagerness on the
_Twelfth Night_ performance. He had heard this and that, and Anne had
told him the other. His interest surprised Anne, he hadnt shown much
to her; only a few laconic questions. And she was wondering what was
in his mind, as she so often wondered when Joe held the floor, when a
question enlightened her:

Have you got anybody to play Sebastian yet?

No. I wanted that boy who played with her on the southern tour last
year, but hes in England. He gave a first-rate performance and he
_did_ look like her.

That was a lucky chance. Youll search the whole profession before you
get any one that looks like Sybils twin brother.

He ought to bear some resemblance to her, and Bassett quoted, One
face, one voice, one habit, and two persons. I wonder if Shakespeare
had twins in his eye when he wrote the play.

Not he! They did the same in his day as they do now--dressed em up
alike and let it go at that. Why, Mrs. Gawtrey, the English actress,
when she was over here, had a boy to play Sebastian who looked as much
like her--well, not as much as I look like Sybil.

Bassett had seen his object as Anne had and was considering. He had
been looking forward to the week at Gull Island with Anne, it loomed in
his imagination as a festival. There would be a pleasant, companionable
group of people, friendly, working well together. But Joe among them----

The boy, looking down at his feet, said slowly:

Whats the matter with letting me do it?

Nothings the matter. Ive no doubt you could, but you and she have
about as much resemblance as chalk and cheese.

Joe wheeled and gathering his coat neatly about his waist walked across
the room with a mincing imitation of Sybils gait. It was so well
done that Bassett could not contain his laughter. Encouraged, the boy
assumed a combative attitude, his face aflame with startled anger,
and striking out, at imaginary opponents, shouted: Why theres for
thee, and there and there and there. Are all the people mad? Then as
suddenly melted to a lovers tone and looking ardently at Anne said:
If it be thus to dream then let me sleep.

Joe, Anne's brother, comes into the room and tells them that Sybil has a visitor. He is interested in the play and asks if they have found someone to play Sebastian yet.
