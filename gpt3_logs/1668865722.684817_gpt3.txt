SCENE:
No, how should I?

I listen all I can but theyre as tight as clams when were around. I
think theyve got a hungry sort of look as if they were on some trail.
Havent you noticed it?

Anne hadnt noticed anything.

Well, I have. I sit there slumped together and acting helpless, but
Im not like the Foolish Virgins--my lamps are lit.

Do you think they have any one in mind?

They have two, dearie, as we all have. They had reached the door
and she opened it warily. And one moment Im thinking its one and
the next moment Im thinking its the other and the third moment Im
thinking its neither of them.

They passed through the doorway and went down the hall, stopping at the
foot of the stairs. Mrs. Cornell offered a last consoling word:

You can be thankful for one thing, Anne, Joes not being here.

Joe?

Oh, Im not saying he had anything to do with it. But these cases--you
read about them in the papers. Every little thing traced up. And she
and Joe having been at loggerheads theyd be pouncing on that--not
telling you anything, sending up your blood pressure with their
questions. Youre spared that and its worth keeping your mind on.
Nothing so bad but what it might be worse.

She went on down the hall. Anne, on the stairs, waited till she heard
the sound of the opening door and Miss Pinkneys welcoming voice,
then she stole upward very softly. She did not go to her room as Mrs.
Cornell had advised, but tiptoed to the end of the hall where the
staircase led to the top story.

She ascended with delicate carefulness letting her weight come
gradually on each step. Despite her precautions the boards creaked. The
sounds seemed portentously loud in the deep quiet and she stopped for
the silence to absorb them, and then, with chary foot, went on. At the
top she stood, subduing her deep-drawn breaths, looking, listening.

The middle of the floor was occupied by a spacious central hall
furnished as a parlor and lit by a skylight. Giving on it were
numerous small bedrooms, the doors open. They were like rows of neat
little cells, all the same, bed, dresser, rocking-chair, with a white
curtained window in the outer wall. The windows were open, the sashes
raised half-way, and the fresh sweet air passing through fanned
the muslin curtains back and forth in curved transparencies. Anne
remembered Miss Pinkney saying something about opening the top-floor
windows to air the servants quarters before the house was closed for
the season.

The stirrings of the curtains, billowing out and drooping, were the
only movements in the place. She moved to the middle of the room and
sent her voice out in a whisper:

Joe, Joe--are you here? Its Anne.

Her ears were strained for an answering whisper, her eyes swept about
for a shape creeping into view, but the silence was unbroken, the
emptiness undisturbed. She entered the rooms, peered about, opened
cupboards, looked for signs of occupation. Again nothing--vacancy, dust
in a film on the bureau tops, beds untouched in meticulous smoothness.

One door was closed, near the stair-head. Opening this she looked into
a store-room, a large, dark interior lit by two small windows. They
were dust grimed, and the light came in dimly, showing upturned trunks
and boxes, pieces of furniture, lines of clothes hanging on the walls.

Here, she thought, and with her heart leaping in her throat, crossed
the threshold:

Joe, its Anne. Ive come to help you.

Nothing stirred in the encumbered space, no stealthy body detached
itself from the shadows.

Oh, answer me if youre there! Her voice rose the shade of a tone.
It came back from the raftered roof in smothered supplication; the
silence it had severed closed again, deep and secretive.

She feared to stay longer and slipped, wraith-like, down the stairs. In
her room she sat down and considered. He must have been there. Where
else could he be unless in one of the unoccupied apartments in the
lower floors. But he hardly would have dared that with people coming
and going. He had been afraid, doubted her as he had always done,
or possibly found a hiding-place too shut away for her whisper to
penetrate. To-night she would have to get food to him, take it up when
the men were in the library and the others safe in their rooms.
