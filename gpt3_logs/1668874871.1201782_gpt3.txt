SCENE:
Mr. Falconer has proposed for me, and George insists on my accepting
him.

Mr. Falconer was a rich gentleman of about forty, who had paid Lilian
marked attention for some time. Lilian affected to look down upon him
because his father had made his money in cotton; but the sneer was
absurd, as her admirer was a man scarcely less stalwart and handsome
than her own brothers, and as much their superior in intellect,
character, and feeling as it was possible for a man to be.

Stephen leaned on his crutches, trembling from head to foot at the
news. He had known very well, poor fellow, in spite of mad dreams after
an occasional moment of her fascinating kindness, that she could never
be his; but her marriage had been a horrible dread for the distant
future, and, now that it proved a not distant reality, his heart sunk
within him. She was touched by the utter prostration of this poor
cripple, who would, as she very well knew, have given his life at any
moment for her. She led him to a chair, and tried to cheer him with a
sort of regal tenderness. At last he said, his lips trembling:

But George cant force you to marry him, Lily.

Yes, he can, practically. The money that ought to have been mine, of
course, I shall never get from this spendthrift crew. George says it is
impossible that he can give me what my father intended me to have, that
the estate is so burdened that there may be a break-up before very
long, and I am half inclined to believe him. So I am portionless, and
ought to think myself lucky to get a husband at all, it seems.

But, Lilian, that is nonsense! You are the most beautiful girl in the
country; you will make a sensation in London, and marry a duke, if you
like. You are surely never going to let George do what he likes with
you, with your high spirit?

The girl did not answer, but impulsively hid her face in her hands. A
light came into Stephens troubled eyes, and he shuddered as he looked
at her.

Lily, he whispered, has George heard anything?

I think so, she answered, without looking up. He just hinted, in a
way that made me think he must have been prying into my affairs, that
it would be better for me to do as he wished. But, after all, she
cried, in a different tone, raising her proud head from the table as
suddenly as she had cast it down, I have done nothing wrong--nothing
to be ashamed of. It is not my fault if I am so hunted and teased and
mistrusted by my own family that I cannot see what friends I please,
but must correspond with them secretly. For I wont give up my friends
at any ones bidding!

But you saw him not long ago, and by your friends invitation, said
Stephen, in a low voice.

What do you mean?

Do you think I didnt know at the first moment of seeing you with
Colonel Richardson, that it was his letters I had been receiving for
you? Oh, Lilian--and he is married!

And what if he is? asked the girl, quietly. I like him well enough
to marry him if he were free; but I am not going to give up his
friendship just because Aunt Constantia and mamma and Annie insulted
him and me when I was in town by saying our acquaintance was improper.
I shall have what friends I please--now and always; and, if I am to
marry Mr. Falconer soon after Christmas, I will see Colonel Richardson
again before then.

Soon after Christmas! echoed Stephen, in a low voice.

So George says. And the sooner the better, for then I shall be free,
said the girl, impatiently. And now you must post a letter for me at
Beckham to-morrow--just one more--the last, she added, coaxingly.

To Colonel Richardson, under cover, as usual, I suppose?

Yes. And, as it is perhaps the very last service you will ever be able
to do me, I am sure you wont tease about it, will you?

It is a very bad service I am doing you, Lily. If George were really
to find it out, I think he would kill me, and perhaps you.

Oh, the sense of honor is not so keen as you imagine in our family!
sneered Lilian. He would bully us both, and perhaps strike one of us;
but he wouldnt risk hanging on your account or mine.

But what do you want to say to Colonel Richardson?

I want to tell him to come and say good-bye to me before he goes away,
for he has been ordered abroad. George wont invite him here again, I
know; but I must see him, and I will.
