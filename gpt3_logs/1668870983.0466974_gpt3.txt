SCENE:
XVIII

_The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve._

SHAKESPEARE.


BUT Moran was not to be found. After the horse had been put up,
Jerry started for the club. Larry and McGonagle began a round of the
divisions; but finding the polling places closed, followed Jerrys
footsteps. The hour was midnight; the moon was pushing its red rim
above the housetops; and the great heart of the city throbbed but
slowly. The streets were silent, deserted, save for a single pedestrian
who now and then loomed up, ghost-like, from the shadows and as
suddenly vanished from view.

So youse tink weve got the bulge, eh? asked Goose, as they hurried
along.

Sure! We copped votes in places where I tought wed get the
dinky-dink. If the other end o the wards as much to the good, were
all right.

An engine pulled out of the freight yard as they were about to pass
and stood coughing and panting upon the path, blocking their passage.
A shower of cinders dropped through the grate bars, turned a dull red
and then expired; a man ran along the top of the cars swinging his lamp
in frantic signals; the moist, grimy face of the fireman peered through
the cab window, his inflamed eyes blinking at the fluttering red spark;
then the lever was reversed with a jerk, and back they go until a
sudden crash and a shrill Why-OO! tells the engineer that another car
has been added to his string.

Come on, said Goose, here comes the loco again. What are youse
lookin at?

Murphy was gazing over his shoulder into the shadow and did not take
advantage of the shifting engines retreat. Two men were swiftly
crossing the street toward them.

Here comes a couple o gents what wants to sling us a breeze, said
Larry. Its either the price of a bed theyre chasin up, or they want
to give us a piece o lead pipe.

The fat one looks like old Kelly, observed McGonagle. Say, _he_
cant be on the fight, kin he?

They waited for the men to come up; and once more the signal lamp
swayed up and down, once more the engine wheezed out upon the path,
groaning and hissing as though in protest. A man rushed down the track,
paused under the flaring head-light to look at some papers, and then
began swearing at someone in the darkness. He had lost one hand and the
stump was armed with an iron hook; this he waved frantically.

Drop them last cars! Go down the next siding and pick up the flats!
You know better than this, Conroy!

The engine seemed to have caught his humour for it snorted angrily; the
crew began twisting madly at the brakes, the lamps were set swinging
down the track; a shadowy form darted out of the gloom, threw open
a switch and was immediately swallowed up again. The panting of the
locomotive grew fainter; from far down the yard its head-light burned
like a dim, red spark. The man with the hook entered a watch box and
angrily slammed the door. Silence!

We heard that yez had come this way, remarked Kelly, as he came up.
McQuirk an mesilf were passin Phil Burks place as he wur shuttin
up an he towld us yez had started for the club.

We want to have a little talk, said the boss, as they walked along.
A little confabulation, you know.

Larry nudged his friend, and received a like signal in return.

All right, said he, cheerfully, sing your song, Mac. Whats on yer
mind?

We want till ax yez-- Kelly began, hurriedly; but McQuirk stopped him.

Let me tend to this, requested he, coolly. He turned to Larry and in
a fatherly fashion laid his hand upon his shoulder. They were under
an arc lamp and in the blue-white light, Larry saw that his face was
wrinkling with smiles.

You boys put up a good fight, said McQuirk. I like the way you
run things. Me an Moran was talkin about an hour ago; hes feelin
obliged to the club for turnin in for Rhinehardt for common council,
and told me to tell you so.

Dont mention it, murmured Larry.
