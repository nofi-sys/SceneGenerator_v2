SCENE:
V

_Hed strop up his razor, graceful an nice,
An then from your face hed carve off a slice.
Your life from the gallows! Ye couldnt be vexed,
When Tecumsha ORileys calling out next._

COMIC SONG.


SCHWARTZS barber shop stood almost within the shadow of the church
tower. The gas light streamed through his plate window and across the
sidewalk; a row of customers lined up along the wall, waiting their
turn in the chair; the fat proprietor stropped a razor and conversed
with a short man who stood at the stove rubbing a freshly reaped chin.
A large aired man, with a dyed moustache, was pulling a pair of kid
gloves over hands too large for them. He wore a light overcoat, a silk
hat, a flower in his buttonhole and seemed to sweat importance. This
was Squire Moran, thrice elected to the minor judiciary and a power in
the ward.

Ach! exclaimed Schwartz, dot vas too pad, Misder Purns.

Its gittin a bit wurried I am, said the little man; for what kin a
body be doin witout a bit av wurk.

Sure I tought, Squire, said Clancy, the grocer, who lay back in the
barbers chair, tucked about with towels, that yez wur goin till give
Tim a job in the water daypartment.

Theres many a slip, Clancy, quoth his honour, struggling with the
gloves. Im not the only duck in the pond, ye know; and its Tims own
fault that he aint in the department long ago.

Hows that? queried the grocer.

McQuirks against him, answered Moran.

Mr. Burns looked downhearted; the others nodded sagaciously as though
the reason given was all sufficient.

I almost got down on my knees to him, went on the magistrate, but he
said no; so what can I do?

Whats he sore on Tim for? asked Goose McGonagle who, in a bright
scarlet tie, sat near the wash-stand.

I wouldnt vote for OConnor, Burns hastened to say. Sure Gartenheim
did me a favour wanst; an wud yez have me go back on a friend?

A murmur went around the room.

But OConnor was the reglar nominee, argued Moran, an if it hadnt
been for the push that turned in for Gartenheim, OConnor ud be
holdin down the office instead of Kelly. McQuirks dead leary on split
tickets--unless he gives the order--an he told ye at the time that
hed remember ye for it.

He had little till do, mumbled Clancy.

Moran laughed. What the boss dont know about practical politics aint
worth knowin, said he. An its the little things what holds the
party in line. So stick to McQuirk an McQuirkll stick to you. He had
succeeded with his gloves by this time and was about to depart. If I
can do anything for you, Tim, he added, Ill do it. But when Mac says
no, why he generally means it. Good night, everybody.

Niver talk till me av politicians, said Clancy; be dad theyre all
tarred wid wan stick. An divil a better are they across the say; sure,
I wur radin in the _Irish World_ that Redmond do be at his tricks
wanst more.

Dyez say so, exclaimed Burns; ah, but the owld dart is in a bad way
betune thim all.

Redmond do be after firin off some illigant spaches, put in Malachi
OHara, from behind a newspaper, an hes an able lad, so he is.
Didnt he take up for Parnell whin--

Parnell! Clancy snorted his disgust so violently as to endanger his
safety from the barbers razor. Dont talk till me av that felly.

Yez wur a Parnell man yezself wanst, Clancy, said Burns, with an
elaborate wink at the others. Sure, I see the chromo av him that came
with the _Freemans Journal_ nailed up on yez wall overight the kitchen
dure.

An divil a long it stayed out av the stove after he wur found out,
said the grocer stoutly.
