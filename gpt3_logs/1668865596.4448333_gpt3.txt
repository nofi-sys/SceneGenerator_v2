Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
How considerate!

Theres no sense getting annoyed about it because I dont think she
has any reason. You have to make excuses for her. Shes gone through
this awful experience and her nerves are all wracked to pieces. You
have to be patient and take her as a sort of afflicted person--

He dashed the cane down and jumped to his feet in a volcanic explosion
of rage:

I dont take her that way. I take her for what she is, a damned lying
hypocrite.

Joe! She was amazed, not so much at the words, as at the suddenness
of the outburst and the contorted passion of his face.

She thinks she can treat me any way she wants and get away with it.
Well, shell find her mistake, shes taken the wrong turning this time.
She takes me for a yellow dog she can kick whenever she feels like it.
But I got teeth, I can bite. Patient--be patient--God, Id like to
wring her neck, the damned----.

He used an epithet that brought Anne to her feet, breathing battle:
Dont dare to say that of my friend, Joe Tracy.

He stood in front of her, hump-shouldered, with outthrust jaw, brows
drawn low over eyes gleaming like a cats. She had never seen him look
like that; he seemed a stranger, a horrible stranger, and she drew
away, aghast at the revelation of a being so sinisterly unfamiliar.
Her look brought him back to self-control. He jerked his head up, ran
a hand over his hair, and turned away to the window. Standing there he
said:

Well, I take that back. I didnt mean to say it. But shes made me
mad; I think shed make anybody.

The tone, surly still, had a placating quality; it was as near an
apology as Joe could ever come. She felt immeasurably relieved for
he had frightened her. To see the family cat, whose vagaries of
temperament she knew by heart, suddenly transformed into a tiger, had
given her a shock. She accepted his amends without comment, but she
could not resist a sisterly admonition:

If youd only stop getting mad over small things youd find life so
much easier.

He laughed:

Good advice from little sister! It doesnt cost anything and its the
correct _ingenue_ pose.

He turned from the window smiling, Joe at his most amiable. If he
had met her this way she would have poured out her secret. But her
high mood had fallen and besides he wanted her to go--he said he had
a letter to write yet. Lounging toward her he put his hands on her
shoulders, gave her a light kiss on the cheek and pushed her toward the
door.

On her way back along the gallery she recalled his face in that
moment of rage with troubled question. She wondered if there was more
disturbing him than she knew--it was an extraordinary exhibition of
anger for such a cause. Also she had not felt sure that his change of
mood was genuine, his laugh had rung false, and when he had laid his
hands on her shoulders she had felt their coldness through the thin
stuff of her neglige. She heaved a sigh of relief at the thought that
he was going. In his present mood there was no knowing what clashes
there might be, and it was the last evening, and there would be a full
moon, and she and Bassett would walk like lovers under its magic light.

When her door had closed, the gallery and living-room became as quiet
as though the house were unoccupied. Sybil, approaching it, heard no
sound of voices, a fact that reassured her, for the long day had tired
her and she had no mind for talk. She was coming in by the balcony when
she saw Flora Stokes sitting there reading and deflected her course
toward the path that skirted the buildings front. If Flora noticed
her she made no sign, her eyes glued to her book, and Sybil, stepping
softly, for she dreaded the womans resentful glances, passed along to
the entrance of the living-room. The place was deserted and she stopped
on the threshold for a last look at the skys fading splendors.

Across the depths of the room the door into the hall opened, but so
gently that she did not hear it. Stokes made this noiseless entrance in
the hope that she might be there, and now, seeing his hope fulfilled,
closed the door as carefully, standing against it watching her.

If the conventional garb of the street was not as becoming to his
darkly Byronic style as the trappings of the Duke, he was still
unusually handsome. A figure of distinction in its lean grace, with
proud hawk features and the deep-set melancholy eyes that the matine
girl loves. Even his pallor had charm in their opinion, adding to his
romantic suggestion. Gull Island sun and breezes had left no trace upon
it; his face against the background of the door was a yellowish white.
