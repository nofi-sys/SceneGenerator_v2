SCENE:
They walked in moody silence for a while, Professor Curtis skipping to
keep up with his friend's loose-jointed stride. Then Professor Dexter
stopped with an exclamation.

"There is a way!" he said. "Look. It seems obvious that what Clarissa
admires in this Jake Donahue is not his conversation but his
overwhelmingly masculine physique. Do you agree?"

Curtis grunted. His own figure was a sore spot with him.

"Against Jake Donahue--let us face it--we do not cut inspiring
figures. I am too tall and you are too short. But suppose we were
to change--suppose I were to come down four or five inches and fill
out correspondingly and you were to come up ten inches and slim out
correspondingly? Then how would we compare with Donahue?"

Professor Curtis stared at him angrily.

"There may be something wrong with my ears, but I doubt it," he
snapped. "I think I heard you say what I heard you say. And I wish to
point out, with bitterness, that this is hardly the time for fanciful
pleasantries."

"Nonsense!" Professor Dexter said. "I am not joking. We have the means
in our grasp. Come along with me and I'll show you."

He hurried the protesting Curtis along, the little man's feet fairly
flying to keep up. At the darkened physics building, Dexter used his
key and let them in. They went up to the laboratory.

"You know my work on the atom," Dexter said. "I have never boasted
of my part in atomic fission which resulted in the atom bomb. I was
pledged to secrecy but there is no harm in telling you what you have
doubtless guessed, that I was one of the physicists whose work on
uranium made the bomb possible."

Curtis nodded. There was no jealousy in him, only the true scientists'
appreciation of a good job well done. He was Dexter's staunchest
booster.

"What I have done," Professor Dexter said, snapping on the lights
in his laboratory, "is to shift my research away from destructive
metallurgy and turn the light of new atom discoveries upon protoplasmic
tissue. If the atoms of metal can be shifted, altered or broken apart,
why not living tissue?"

"Because your subject would die, obviously," Curtis replied.

"They did, at first," Dexter admitted. "The reason was that the
cyclotron--" he waved at a hulking monster which looked like two giant
Swiss cheeses lying flat, one above the other "--was much too powerful
to use on living things. The problem was to use less power, apply it
more slowly, yet retain the ability to move the electrons about the
nucleus."

Excitement began to pop in Professor Curtis' voluable face.

"You did it?" he stammered.

"I did it. Needing only reduced power, I scaled down the cyclotron and
incorporated the electron stream in this cathode tube. What I have here
is essentially a pocket-sized cyclotron which I am satisfied will have
no lethal effect upon living tissue."

"But what will it do?"

Professor Dexter shrugged bony shoulders.

"Anything. By exerting the proper kind of force on the electrons I can
crowd them together, thus reducing anything in size. By bombarding
them with a different intensity I can cause them to repel each other
and thus increase the size of the subject. Or--I could simply alter his
appearance by shifting the arrangement of the atom, or by knocking out
some of the electrons which would change his chemical composition."

"Then you can actually make us smaller or larger?"

"I am convinced of it. I never intended, nor expected, to put the
machine to such frivolous uses. I had dedicated it to pure science.
But what is science, after all, but a tool which man should use for a
better life? And our lives are now affected, Professor. We must use
science to solve our own problems."

"Admirably put."

Professor Dexter laid his hand on a huge shining cathode tube, whose
terminal ends were clamped in the shining copper embrace of a massive
induction coil.

"To be fair, we will need two of these. We will both undergo the
experiment simultaneously--you to grow, I to shrink. Will you take the
risk, Professor?"


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the idea of using science to solve personal problems. Professor Dexter has invented a machine that can alter a person's physical appearance, and he proposes using it to make himself and Professor Curtis more attractive to women. Curtis is initially skeptical, but Dexter convinces him to try it.
