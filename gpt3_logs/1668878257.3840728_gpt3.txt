Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Teddy felt himself growing hot under the collar at the consummate
nerve of the man. Standing there arguing a question of ethics just
after having tried to murder him!

Throwin a guy out this time of night, hey? Marino demanded.

Yes--Im throwing you out. Going?

The Pup looked over toward the corral, then back to Teddy. He
grinned sardonically.

Not havin no more reason for stayin, Ill be on my way, he
declared. Soon as I-- He made a move toward his knife.

Teddy took a quick step forward, and put his foot on the weapon.

That stays here, the boy said grimly. Wheres your pony?

Marino motioned with his thumb toward a group of trees on the edge
of the ranch yard.

Over there. I just rode by to get some duds I left here. But never
mind em now, he added suddenly. Ill get em later. Hope you
choke.

With this pleasant farewell, the man walked in the direction he had
said his horse was tied. Teddy watched him go, a fixed look on his
face.

Cow-puncher, hey? the boy muttered. Youre as much a cow-puncher
as I am a Chinaman! Lets have a look at this toad-sticker. He bent
over and picked up the knife. Holding it up, he saw that the
initials J. K. were burned in the handle. The blade was long and
curved slightly.

J. K.--the K standing for Marino, the boy mused. Some day well
have this little argument out, Mister J. K. Marino. But you wont
have one of these things in your hand when we do. Lucky for me I saw
you make a dive for it, or Id be plumb tired of living by now.

A moment more he gazed at the knife, then absently he stuck it in
his belt. Slowly he continued on his way to the bunk-house, to see
Nat Raymond.

Before they turned in he told Roy of the occurrence. With the door
of their room shut tight, so as not to disturb Mrs. Manley, the boys
talked far into the night. When finally they switched off the light
they had come to no decision except to agree that Marino was not to
be allowed on X Bar X property again. Yet, had they known it, this
was, in effect, locking the stable after the horse had been stolen.

While Teddy and Roy were talking things over in their room, another
conversation, quite relative to theirs, was being carried on within
the doors of the bunk-house. Despite the appeals of a few men to
can the chatter an go to sleep, Nat Raymond and Pop Burns were
verbally appointing themselves a committee of investigation.

Me, Im goin to try to find Gus an bring him back, Pop declared,
pulling hard on his pipe. Hes too good a man to--Jim, take yore
toe outa my eye! Hes too good a man to lose.

Well, then go an chin somewhere else! Jim Casey ordered
petulantly. You guys loaf all day an want to stay up all night.
Us, we got to work!

Who loafs all day? Pop asked indignantly. I do a blamed sight
more work than you do, Jim Casey, young as you are! So fold that
behind the rim of yore derby!

Aw, let him rave, Nat Raymond pleaded. He only wants to start an
argument. Listen! How you gonna find Gus?

Dont know. But I will somehow as soon as the boss comes back.
Hell be glad to see the old geezer. The boss hated to fire Gus as
much as Gus hated to be fired, Ill bet--maybe more. But Bardwell
was all het up over what Jake Trummer said. Being the oldest man on
the X Bar X, Pop felt privileged to take liberties with the bosss
name. You know, Nat, he continued, that time Belle Ada and the
others were kidnapped took a lot out of the old boy. He aint as
young as he was once--none of us are, and Pop puffed reminiscently.
I mark the time that--

For the love of seven kinds of gorillas, will you guys pipe down?
came a voice from one of the upper bunks. What do you think this
is--a lecture hall?

Since several others took up their grievances at this point, Pop and
Nat were compelled to desist and turn in. But Pop called across to
Nat that when the boss came back he was goin to ask for a few days
leave an hunt Gus up. Nat added hed do the same and hunt Marino
down, and the whole room echoed this sentiment. The Pup had
succeeded in making himself uniformly unpopular during his stay at
the X Bar X.
