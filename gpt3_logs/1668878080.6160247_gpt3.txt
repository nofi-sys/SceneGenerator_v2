SCENE:
With a cowardly yell, his courage fled and he fell to his knees.

Dont shoot! he begged, his whole body shaking. Dont shoot me!
These men made me do it! They forced me into it! I aint done
nothin. I swear I aint! I even killed the head of this gang,
Brand! You ought to let me off for doin that!

Teddy looked down at the groveling figure. He turned and glanced at
the other rustlers, who, realizing that the game was up, stood
quietly by, hands held high in the air.

Brave leader youve got, the boy said.

One of the men looked down with a contemptuous sneer.

Him? He aint no leader. Hes a yeller dog! Wait an Ill fix him
for you. Hear what he said about Brand? I knew somethin was up. The
rat said Brand told him to go ahead with the raid an hed meet us
at the Bowl. So you killed Brand, did you? Well, kiss yoreself
good-bye, cause yore sure goin on a long journey!

The mans hand flashed down to his side. There was a crack, and a
tongue of flame belched from the muzzle. Froud gave a shrill scream
and gripped his left shoulder at the same moment that Roy and Nick
rode closer and covered the fellow who had shot.

But the man did not fire again.

Im gettin pretty poor, he said in a sad voice. Dont worry,
son, I wont do no more shootin. Here, take the gun. I wont have
no use for it where Im goin. Bout time I had a rest, I guess.
First time I ever failed to kill a snake with one shot. And at ten
paces, too! Yore lucky, Froud! Look at him wiggle! Lets hear you
sound yore rattles, you cussed sidewinder!

Thatll do, Mr. Manley said sternly, riding up. You almost had a
charge of murder against you--though it dont seem like murder to
shoot a snake. Froud, stop that yellin! You aint killed! Get on
your feet. Lets see. Mr. Manley dismounted, and, ripping the mans
shirt open, disclosed a small gash in the fleshy part of the
shoulder.

You snivilin coward! the cattle owner cried. All that shoutin
over a scratch! Get on your bronc now, an be quick about it! Were
ridin in. Nick an Gus, stay in back. Keep your guns out. The rest
of you ride close. If any one makes a break, shoot an shoot
straight! Heres where this rustlin stops, once an for all! Well
find out from these rats who those were who got away. Then they
wont dare show their faces around here again.

Dont let him get near me, Froud whined, pointing at the man who
had shot him. Hell kill me if he can! He was Brands friend--

An you knifed Brand, Mr. Manley finished, with a fierce frown.
You rat! You ought to be strung up!

But it aint murder to kill a rustler, is it? Froud asked eagerly.
It aint! I could get a reward fer doin it, couldnt I? Hes
wanted! The police in three states want him! So if I show you his
body I get the reward, dont I? Dont I?

Mr. Manley looked at him.

Froud, he said slowly, I seen some snakes in my time. At least,
till now I thought I had. I cant blame that bucker for shootin
you. Too bad he wasnt a better shot. Froud, listen to this! Brand
aint dead! Hes alive, an hes lookin for you!

Frouds face went livid. He swayed in his saddle.

He--he--aint dead? he stammered. But--I--

You tried your best! But it wasnt quite good enough, an my boys
here saved his life. He got to that cabin of yours, an Roy an
Teddy bound up his wound. He told everything, an hell be in the
saddle again in two weeks. Froud, youre a marked man!

The rustler caught at the saddle horn. He trembled as though with
the ague, and wet his lips with his tongue. He strove to speak, but
the words would not come.

Save em, Nick Looker said in a contemptuous voice. You might
need later all the talk you got. Come on now! Ride on! We aint got
all night. All right, boss? Do we go?

We go, Nick! An dont worry about watchin Froud. If he starts to
fall off, you might prop him back on again. Boys, were off! Were
headin home with a rare cargo! Lets go!

The procession of horsemen filed into the yard of the X Bar X just
as the gray dawn was breaking. On all but four of the riders were
happy grins. One of these four sagged low in the saddle. Frequently
his tongue ran over his dry lips. And on the side of his face a
scar, like a small snake, shone livid against his sickly pallor.
