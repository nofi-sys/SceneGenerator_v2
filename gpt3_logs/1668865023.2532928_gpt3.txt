SCENE:
Oh, no, darling, dont say that! Your dear father is only desirous
of one thing, to promote your welfare. And Mr Walcheren is very wild,
Jenny. He would not make you a good husband. Everybody says so.

And so my happiness is to be sacrificed because everybody chooses to
tell lies of the man I like, and papa and you choose to believe them.
Well! I shant forget it in a hurry, I can tell you, mamma. And now,
please let me go to my room in peace. I suppose I may claim a right to
so much indulgence of my own wishes.

My dear girl, when have any of your wishes been ungratified, unless
they were likely to prove hurtful to yourself. We should take a knife
away from a baby, my darling, however much it cried for it, for fear it
should cut itself.

Thank you for comparing me to a baby, mamma, but I think you will find
I am not quite such a child as you imagine. Anyway, I am woman enough
to wish to be left alone to think over this matter by myself.

And, without waiting for an answer, Jenny ran up the staircase, and
locked herself into her bedroom.

The two ladies downstairs were left in a very uncomfortable condition.

I hope, remarked Mrs Crampton to her sister, I hope dear papa
did not go too far in what he said. Jenny is so high-spirited and
quick-tempered, that she might be tempted to do something wilful just
because she was crossed. And if she dances with Mr Walcheren at the
Bouchers to-night, I dont know what her papa will say.

Oh, she would never dare to do so, surely, replied Aunt Clem; she
would never fly in Johns face in that manner! She is a little fond of
her own way sometimes, I admit, but she has a good heart, poor darling,
and says far more than she means. And John is right, Emma. Mr Walcheren
is a very wild young man, and it would never do for our Jenny to marry
him.

Of course, John is right, acquiesced the wife; but I wish Jenny
could see it in the same light. However, I will take care not to let
her out of my sight this evening, and then it will be impossible for Mr
Walcheren to get speech of her, without my overhearing what he may say.

Meanwhile, Jenny, having reached the sanctuary of her own room, drank
off her chocolate hastily, and dismissed her maid who was in attendance.

Is my bath ready, Ellen? she inquired; that is right. Well! you can
go now and I will ring when I am ready to dress. Tell Brunell that I
will have the Ralli cart at one.

Before luncheon, miss? said the maid.

At one oclock, sharp! And dont go out of the way; I shall want you
in ten minutes.

She turned the key of her door on the inside as the maid disappeared,
and, sitting down before her writing-table, drew out pen and paper, and
commenced to write a letter, which ran as follows:--

DARLING,--There has been a row here this morning, and papa has
forbidden me ever to speak to you again. What are we to do? I shall be
at the Bouchers to-night, without fail. I must not dance with you,
but, if you will be in the picture gallery after the fourth dance, I
will contrive to speak to you. Oh, Fred, where is all this going to
end? They shall never make me give you up, if you remain of the same
mind, but open communication with you seems almost impossible. I cant
write any more, my head and my heart are both in a whirl. Ever your
loving

JENNY.

She sealed this letter, and directed it to Frederick Walcheren,
Esq., 308 Nevern Mansions, Earls Court, London, and placed it on one
side. Her next concern was to see in what condition this unpleasant
excitement had left her. But she found no reason to complain.

The exercise of her temper had made her cheeks rosier, and lent an
extra brightness to her eyes. She was glad of this--glad that she had
not given way to the weakness of tears, and swelled up her eyelids and
made her face look puffy. She might meet Frederick during her drive. He
spent most of his spare time in wandering about Hampstead in the hopes
of meeting her. But she seldom drove out until the afternoon. Still,
there was just the chance of a _rencontre_ with her lover, and for that
chance Jenny would have taken more trouble than this.

When she came downstairs again, an hour later, dressed in a tailor-made
suit of light fawn tweed, with her jaunty little felt hat on her
head, and her hands in white doeskin driving-gloves, holding a
handsome ivory-handled whip, few people would have guessed the state
of excitement she was still in, she looked so fresh and lovely and
smiling. In the hall she encountered her mother, who had heard the
wheels of the Ralli cart draw up to the door.
