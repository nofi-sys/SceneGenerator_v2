SCENE:
XXIV
THE TRAIL OE THE SERPENT


Alice, have you seen Esther McCleary lately? Mark asked abruptly as he
entered the house.

No, I have not. She seems to avoid us since Elinor and Tibby came. I
wonder if it is on account of Donald? Why does she act so?

I am afraid, Alice, there has been, or will be, a tragedy in Esthers
life, which will wreck it, Mark answered.

Why, what do you mean? What can have happened?

Have you heard nothing about her mysterious wanderings away from home
lately?

No.

Well, it seems she has been given to somnambulancy. She has gotten up
in the middle of the night and left the house upon more than one
occasion. Last night, when I was coming home from the fort, I came upon
her walking alone upon the prairie, wringing her hands and sobbing
bitterly. I called to her, and she at first tried to run from me, but at
last she allowed me to put her upon my horse and bring her home. I
questioned her, and finally the poor child told me the cause of her
wanderings. It seems Russells power did not end with his presence, but
after hypnotizing her a number of times he could control her, even
though absent. He never tried to use this baneful power until recently,
or since he was here the last time before now.

But when did he come back? I didnt know he had returned, said Alice,
a troubled look upon her face.

The Lord only knows! replied Mark, with a scowl. I hoped wed seen
the last of him.

I did too, Mark. I really did. I have been so much happier since Elinor
and Tibby came, and now, when it is most time for them to go, to think
hes come again.

He must not come hereafter they have gone away, at any rate. I dont
mind it much if they are here, for Tibby, I think, will be a match for
him. But afterwards, if I catch him here Ill shoot him like the vermin
he is!

But, Mark, theyd hang you for it.

Twould be in a good cause. But really I dont think hell come again
after I have interviewed him once. This affair of Esthers is going to
make the place too hot for him.

O, yes, you were telling me. Go on. What about Esther?

Why, it appears he willed her to meet him in the cotton-wood grove that
borders the canon. The poor child swears that she knew nothing and was
conscious of nothing until she found herself face to face with this
arch-fiend, alone and beyond the call of friends. She tried to flee from
him, but could not. He seemed to hold her, powerless to help herself.

You horrify me, Mark!

I am myself so enraged I can hardly exercise self-control. Think of
having a man in the community with the power to call his victims to him
at will.

Does Donald know of this?

No, I think not yet. I am afraid that when he does it will end
everything between him and Esther, if there has been anything, which I
doubt. I believe Don has a friendly interest in Esther, but I suspect he
is growing fond of Tibby.

Indeed! Well, I dont see how he could help it. But Esther is such a
good girl.

Yes, before she became the nervous wreck she is, because of
thatRussell. Mark ground his teeth.

O Mark, this is dreadful, dreadful! What can be done?

The hound must be driven from this community, now and forever. This
poor girls obsession is sufficient excuse for a mob with tar and
feathers. Were it not for the publicity of the thing, and the pain
Esther would experience should these night wanderings be made public, I
would organize a posse myself, to-night, and ride the fellow out of the
territory on a rail.

Ah, Mark, you must not go against the laws of the land. Mob violence
can never be right.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the depth of Mark's anger towards Russell and to establish the conflict between Russell and the community. Mark is determined to drive Russell out of the community, even if it means resorting to mob violence. Alice tries to reason with him, but he is beyond listening.
