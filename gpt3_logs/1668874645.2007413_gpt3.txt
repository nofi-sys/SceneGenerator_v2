Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
Why?

Never mind why. It is his nasty temper.

He wouldnt find it so easy, I should think.

No. We should be always pitching each other out of the window if we
were not so well matched; as it is, when any of us are excited beyond
endurance, we pitch the child out.

The child?

Yes--that great gawky boy who thought he was going to have all
your conversation to himself by putting you between himself and my
father. He hasnt come to his full strength yet. We can still do great
execution upon him if we take him unawares.

The talk continued chiefly on his side until the general conversation
turned upon racing, and he hastened, with an eager interest which no
woman could excite in him, to join in the argument that was going
forward. When he again glanced at the girl by his side, she was looking
puzzled and rather prim.

Our talk about horses and betting shocks you, I see, he laughed. You
think it very wicked.

No, indeed, I dont. But I am not used to it. It is so new to me, at
least, since I have been a governess.

Since you have been a governess? Well, that cant be very long. And
did you hear talk like ours before?

Not--quite like yours; but I have heard gentlemen talk about racing
and theaters, and--things like that, at home, before my father died.

Is that long ago?

No--rather tremulously.

Are you happy at the Vicarage?

Oh, yes, they are very kind to me!

So that now any conversation that is not serious surprises and
distresses you?

Oh, no; I like it!

You like our profane conversation? Then why were you looking so prim
just now? When I turned to you, you looked so solemn and severe, that
the first words that occurred to me froze on my lips. I hadnt a word
to say.

That was because I cant talk about horses.

The little governess plucked up spirit enough to fire this shot under
cover of the rising of the ladies, and George Braithwaite followed the
small retreating figure with his eyes with more interest than he had
yet felt in her. In the talk with his father and brothers which now
went on unrestrainedly upon their favorite topics, Harry found occasion
to disagree with his eldest brother upon every point. George bore
this with a good-humor he seldom showed except when he wished to be
irritating. The younger was already almost at boiling-point when they
left the dining-room, where it had been unanimously decided that Miss
Lane was very pretty, but had no spirit, no go, and that the Vicarage
had crushed all the youth out of everything about her but her face.

George and Harry left the dining-room, the former by the door, the
latter by the French window; and they entered the drawing-room at the
same moment. Their mother and sister were at the piano looking for a
missing song, but the demure little figure in white was not in the
room. George merely asked if either of them had seen his cigar-case;
but Harry burst out:

Wheres Miss Lane?

Oh, the child has taken her off somewhere to play with him! said
Lilian. You all seem very much excited about the governess, she added
rather contemptuously.

But Harry left the room. Miss Lane was prim, certainly, and had nothing
to say for herself; but she was very pretty, and, moreover, he felt
bound to show George that he was not to have it all his own way, as he
had seemed at dinner to think he was doing.

He searched the billiard-room, the morning-room, opened the windows,
and looked out on to the lawn. At last he thought he heard the sound
of laughter up-stairs, and, mounting the staircase in a few bounds,
he was led by the excited cries of the child!--Take care!--Well
done!--Caught, by Jove!--and by girlish laughter and the scuffling
of feet toward the picture-gallery. On the inner side of the door by
which he entered it hung a heavy curtain; he pulled it aside just far
enough to peep through into the long half-lighted gallery.
