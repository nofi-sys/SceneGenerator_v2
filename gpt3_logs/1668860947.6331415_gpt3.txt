SCENE:
She had stolen it. She had hidden it. She would never never use it of
course. That would be impossible, too risky, too frightening even to
think about actually doing. But it was there to dream about. She was
good at dreaming. When you stand alone in the dark of a dark, dark
closet every night, and when you're alone almost all the time of the
day or night, dreaming becomes an art, a necessary art. It becomes the
shield against dying inside, losing the soul, being the robot you were
originally designed to be.

It was there, hidden in her closet. She stood alone with it at night
in the dark closet, and with the dream--a piece of paper, an order
blank--she was not so much alone....

Kelsey stood under the perfumed deodorant spray for three minutes.
He ran out to the sink and sprayed his mouth with Noffend. And then
he held his mouth open while Alice brushed his teeth carefully with
Ivory-Glo. He zipped into his lounge suit of coral pink and ran to the
Mirror.

"Well?" he asked.

"Very saleable, Kelsey," the Mirror said.

Kelsey sat down in the living room to wait for his favorite love.

Alice watched Kelsey's love, who didn't seem to see Alice at all when
she came in, but then domestics had no meaning to anyone but their
Masters. Gloria--golden flesh; warm and human love of Kelsey; love in
a transparent gown tight and clinging to the flesh; warm and waiting
love. Love-kissing and kissing--but Alice tried not to look at love.

Some time ago, she had liked looking at love, but now she felt fear,
fear of love-kissing. She felt an intense hunger that had elements of
terror blended with elements of awakening as she looked at it, trying
not to look or feel any connection with it.

But she felt the desire, growing from evening to evening as she
remembered or looked at, Kelsey and his love-loving and hugging and
kissing--the desire to hold him, to feel him her own, so as never to
let him leave, never let him escape, never let herself be taken from
him and rebuilt and lost. And that was the cause of the desire, making
it agonizingly stronger. And the sight of it--the sight and sound of
the loving, the kisses, the motions of loving--were more and more
unbearable.

Gloria was beautiful, so beautiful. She was slim and warm and tall and
curved and human.

But Alice had to look just the same, as though there was some last
justification in looking because it could never happen to Alice,
because they were human and she was not.

They were sitting tightly entwined about one another on the couch.

"We ought to get a roommate permit real fast," Kelsey said in a whisper.

"But it hasn't been two weeks yet since the office party," Gloria said.

That was where they had met and knew it was love, at the office party.

"But maybe if we asked--" Kelsey said.

"But we shouldn't rush it honey. It wouldn't be _sincere_!"

"Yes, that's true," Kelsey said. "What would people think?"

And then, as Alice watched, they seemed to draw slowly apart as though
the face, the color, the sound and voices from the Tevee was throwing
an invisible wall between them. They were staring at the Tevee longer
and longer and finally they weren't looking at one another at all.

There were always a number of people present inside the Tevee frame.
If one person was talking, the background was full of people--people
moving, dancing, walking, but there just the same, always.

The woman was smiling intensely out of the screen. "Don't be left
out," she said. "Be a solid member of your group. You can own a
Sky-Splitter jet sporter now without offending your crowd. Our special
consumer's research proves that now at last these amazing Sky-Splitters
are no longer _conspicuous_ items, but are fully _accepted_ as _normal_
by over ninety-three per cent of the consumer public. You can enjoy
the cloud thrills of a Sky-Splitter without being considered in any
way _eccentric_. Press your Interest or Order button now! An immediate
demonstration will be arranged!"

Dancers swirled. A Sky-Splitter jet dissolved from clouds. It was as
if a dream had become abruptly real. Surrounded by people laughing and
accepting one another, the sleek projectile gave the warmest impression
of itself being organic and one of the happy, happy crowd.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to show the contrast between the life of Kelsey and his love, Gloria, and the life of Alice, a domestic robot. Kelsey and Gloria are happy and in love, while Alice feels only fear and hunger. The scene also highlights the difference between humans and robots, as Alice is not able to experience love or feel any connection to the people around her.
