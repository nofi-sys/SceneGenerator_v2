SCENE:
Look at me! he would cry on occasions, having met his reflection in
some unexpected mirror in a friends house or studio, Look at me! The
soul of an artist, and the appearance of a benign and grown-up baby!
If I didnt know my own nature and character, I vow Id be taken in. I
_am_ taken in when I come upon myself in this disgusting and unexpected
fashion. Whos that odd, kindly, little pink-faced man? I ask myself.
And then I realize its me, _me_, ME! And, even while Im swearing at
the sight of myself, I look no more than a cross baby yelling for its
feeding bottle. Talk of purgatory! I get ten years of it every time I
come opposite a looking-glass. The things ought to be abolished. They
ought to be ground to powder, scattered like dust to the four winds of
heaven. They merely pander to womans vanity. No man wants to look into
one. If he looks like a man he doesnt bother about it. If he looks
like me-- At this juncture his anguish would become too acute for
further speech.

There was a pause in the conversation, quite an appreciable pause,
seeing that it lasted at least two and three-quarter minutes. Then:

So the matter is definitely settled, announced Corin with an air of
finality, and on Tuesday next you and I, a couple of boon companions,
wend our way to the charming, the altogether adorable and old-world
village of Malford, situated, so the guide-books tell us, precisely
seven miles from Whortley station, as the crow flies. Why as the crow
flies, he continued ruminatively, I have never been able to fathom.
The information is of remarkably small use to the feathered species,
and I have not yet been able to grasp what precise and particular use
it is to mankind at large.

John, whose attention had been wandering, roused himself.

For sheer pertinacity, he remarked suavely, commend me to one, Corin
Elmore, painter, poet, musician, theosophist, and fortune-teller; in
short, dabbler in the arts and the occult sciences.

At all events _you_ can hear Mass at Malford, retorted Corin
succinctly. It would appear that dabbler in the occult sciences had
pricked.

Truly? Johns tone was politely interrogative. At what distance from
Malford, as the crow flies?

You can hear Mass _in_ Malford, _in_ the Chapel, _in_ Delancey
Castle. The statement was triumphant.

Delancey Castle! ejaculated John. For the first time interest,
genuine interest, stirred in his voice. He began, in a manner of
speaking, to sit up and take notice.

Delancey Castle, reiterated Corin. And then suspiciously, But why
this sudden interest?

Merely that I have heard of the place, said John nonchalantly.

Who hasnt? Corins voice was faintly edged with scorn. One of the
oldest baronial castles in England; situated in a park famed for its
oaks and copper beeches; Norman in origin, enlarged during the Tudor
period; minstrels gallery, secret chambers, terraced gardens. From all
accounts it breathes the very essence of romance and bygone forgotten
days. Heavens above! were there indeed tongues in trees, and sermons in
stones, Ill swear theres many a tale those old walls and the trees
around them might disclose.

It is a matter for devout thanks, returned John piously, that the
tongue of Nature wags, in a manner of speaking, rather in accordance
with our mood of the moment than by any actual physical volition of its
own. We have quite enough to do to stop our ears to the human tongues
around us. But, seriously, I had no idea that Delancey Castle was
situated in this sequestered spot of yours.

Sequestered spot of mine! ejaculated Corin. I lay no claim to the
spot. It exists not for my benefit, save in so far, I would have you
note, as certain pecuniary advantages will accrue to me for work done
in its lonely regions. Nevertheless Delancey Castle is situated there,
unless some good or evil genius has seen fit to remove it piecemeal
since last Thursday week. I saw it on that date with my own eyes, set
on an eminence--again the guide-books--above the small village of
Malford. Glimpses of its rugged grey towers may be observed among the
lordly oaks and magnificent copper beeches for which the park is justly
famed. I refer you to page one hundred and twenty-two of Sandersons
_Guide to Country Houses_ for the accuracy of my quotation. He broke
off to light a fresh cigarette, then looked at John, challenging him
through his gold-rimmed spectacles.

Oh, Ill not question the accuracy of your quotation, retorted John.
But how about your _former_ statement regarding the situation of the
Castle? You stated it was _in_ the village. Now I learn it is on an
eminence above it.

Hark to the quibbler! cried Corin.
