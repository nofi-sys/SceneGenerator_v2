SCENE:
He found them in a group near the pine grove, excitedly conferring
together. They had been back and forth to the house and the wharf, some
aimlessly running about, others trying to do something intelligent and
helpful. Stokes had just returned with the electric torch and they were
preparing to search the ground for foot-prints. Bassett brought their
activities to an end and shepherded them to the house. With dragging
feet and lowered heads they trailed up the path and filed into the
living-room.

Here, under the radiance of the lights, they looked at one another as
if expecting to see startling changes and fell groaning into chairs,
or sat, stiff and upright, with rigid muscles. The effect of the shock
showed in Mrs. Cornell, Stokes and Shine, in a sudden outburst of
loquacity. They went over and over it, what they were saying, where
they were, what had entered their minds when they heard the shot.
And I thought to myself, sentence after sentence started that way.
Then the feverish talk began to die. Bassett had told them when the
authorities might be expected and as the hour drew near, dread of the
drama in which they found themselves stilled their tongues. The sea
breeze, freighted with the acrid odors of uncovered mud and seaweed,
blew through the room. Bassett rose and closed the garden door, and
eyes shifted to him, hung on his hand as it slid the bolt.

What are you shutting the door for? Mrs. Cornell quavered.

I thought there was too much draught.

Oh, what does that matter, she wailed, with Sybil killed and
floating out to sea?

She broke into loud hiccoughing sobs. Stokes shifted in his chair and
snarled out:

Cant you stop making that noise?

Bassett crossed to where Anne was sitting by the entrance. She had her
back to the room and was looking out at the lights of Hayworth dotting
the shore. He stood behind her chair and put his hand on her shoulder.
Her fingers stole up and rested on his, icy cold. He bent till his head
was close to hers and whispered:

Bear up. Thank God this cant touch you in any way.

Her fingers pressed an answer but she said nothing.

Shine came toward them: Those fellers were lucky who got off this
afternoon. I might have gone with them if Id had the sense.

Anne answered this time:

Yes, they were more fortunate than we are.

Mrs. Cornell, her sobs under control, spoke up:

But even if we _were_ here they cant suspect us. Weve got alibis,
were all accounted for. We were all in----

She realized where she was going and stopped. There was a portentous
silence. Shine almost shouted, pointing out at the channel:

The tides falling fast. They cant get into the dock here. How will
they make a landing?

Bassett answered:

In a cove at the upper end of the island. Theyve a dock there for low
water. They have to make a detour, thats all.

Flora, who had been sitting with her hand over her eyes, dropped it
and sat erect. Her breath came from her in a loud exhalation that
was almost a groan. Every pair of eyes shifted to her, watchful,
questioning, apprehensive.

Do you feel ill, Flora? said Bassett, moving to her side.

No--no, she looked wildly about. But this waiting--its so awful.

Miss Pinkney suggested a glass of water, but Flora waved a hand as if
pushing it away. Stokes rose and moved to a seat beside her.

Theyll be here soon now.

She sank back and closed her eyes. Her husband bent a somber, sidewise
look toward her, then laid his hand on one of hers. Her own turned and
the thin fingers twined like clinging roots about his.

It wont be hard, he reassured. Just give them a clear account of
what you saw.

She waved the other hand in front of her face, like a person in
unendurable pain, who makes a vague distracted gesture for silence.
