SCENE:
VIII
I HORSEWHIP AN OFFICER

We passed days of mental anguishhearing nothing, knowing nothingand
then one evening a single Kash Guard rode up to Fathers house. Juana
and I were there with Mother. The fellow dismounted and knocked at the
doora most unusual courtesy from one of these. He entered at my
bidding and stood there a moment looking at Mother. He was only a lada
big, overgrown boy, and there was neither cruelty in his eyes nor the
mark of the beast in any of his features. His mothers blood evidently
predominated, and he was unquestionably not all Kalkar. Presently he
spoke.

Which is Julian 8ths woman? he asked; but he looked at Mother as
though he already guessed.

I am, said Mother.

The lad shuffled his feet and caught his breathit was like a stifled
sob.

I am sorry, he said, that I bring you such sad news, and then we
guessed that the worst had happened.

The mines? Mother asked him, and he nodded affirmatively.

Ten years! he exclaimed, as one might announce a sentence of death,
for such it was. He never had a chance, he volunteered. It was a
terrible thing. They are beasts!

I could not but show my surprise that a Kash Guard should speak so of
his own kind, and he must have seen it in my face.

We are not all beasts, he hastened to exclaim.

I commenced to question him then and I found that he had been a sentry
at the door during the trial and had heard it all. There had been but
one witnessthe man who had informed on Father, and Father had been
given no chance to make any defense.

I asked him who the informer was.

I am not sure of the name, he replied; he was a tall,
stoop-shouldered man. I think I heard him called Peter.

But I had known even before I asked. I looked at Mother and saw that she
was dry-eyed and that her mouth had suddenly hardened into a firmness of
expression such as I had never dreamed it could assume.

Is that all? she asked.

No, replied the youth, it is not. I am instructed to notify you that
you have thirty days to take another man, or vacate these premises, and
then he took a step toward Mother. I am sorry, Madam, he said. It is
very cruel; but what are we to do? It becomes worse each day. Now they
are grinding down even the Kash Guard, so that there are many of us
who; but he stopped suddenly as though realizing that he was on the
point of speaking treason to strangers, and turning on his heel he quit
the house and a moment later was galloping away.

I expected Mother to break down then; but she did not. She was very
brave; but there was a new and terrible expression in her eyesthose
eyes that had shone forth always with love. Now they were bitter,
hate-filled eyes. She did not weepI wish to God she had. Instead she
did that which I had never known her to do beforeshe laughed aloud.
Upon the slightest pretext, or upon no pretext at all, she laughed. We
were afraid for her.

The suggestion dropped by the Kash Guard started in my mind a train of
thought of which I spoke to Mother and Juana, and after that Mother
seemed more normal for a while, as though I had aroused hope, however
feeble, where there had been no hope before. I pointed out that if the
Kash Guard was dissatisfied, the time was ripe for revolution, for if we
could get only a part of them to join us there would surely be enough of
us to overthrow those who remained loyal to The Flag. Then we would
liberate all prisoners and set up a republic of our own such as the
ancients had had.

It took time to develop my plan. I talked with everyone I could trust
and found them all willing to join me when we had enough. In the
meantime, I cared for my own place and Fathers as wellI was very busy
and time flew rapidly.

About a month after Father was taken away, I came home one day with
Juana who had accompanied me up-river in search of a goat that had
strayed. We had found its carcass, or rather its bones, where the
hellhounds had left them. Mother was not at our house, where she now
spent most of her time, so I went over to Fathers to get her. As I
approached the door I heard sounds of an altercation and scuffling that
made me cover the few remaining yards at a rapid run.
