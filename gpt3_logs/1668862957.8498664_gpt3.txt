SCENE:
XXVIII


AS GOOD AS THE WHEAT

Through the crowd at the mouth of the mine word flashed that the cage
was coming up. All night they had waited there, the wives and children
of the imprisoned miners, the residents of Piodie who knew one or
another of the men caught in the raging inferno below. The women and the
little ones had wept themselves dry of tears long since. They stood now
with taut nerves, eyes glued to the cage as it swept into sight.

Someone started a cheer as the first of the rescued men stepped out to
the platform. A wail of anguish rose above it and killed the cheer. It
came from a young wife with a shawl over her head. She had asked a
question of one of the men and learned that her husband was dead.

The crowd pressed close to those who had come up from the fire. A woman
gave a sob of joy and fell into the arms of a grimy Cousin Jack. Another
caught a glimpse of her husbands face and fainted.

In the excitement two men pushed through the crowd toward a pile of
lumber. The one in front moved with sullen reluctance. Only the pressure
against his back kept him going. Nobody noticed that he was handcuffed.

From underneath the lumber pile the second man drew a sawed-off shotgun.

Well be movin down to town, he told his captive.

Dutch shouted one word, Dodson.

The mine owner swung round, and at the first glance understood the
situation. He turned pale and stepped behind Carstairs. Not for a moment
did he doubt that McClintock had come to kill Dutch. Would he make a
clean sweep of it and shoot him, too? Convicted of guilt, he crouched
behind his superintendent shaking like an aspen.

Dont let him kill me, he begged.

Hugh spoke, his voice cold and hard. Im not on the shoot to-day,
Dodsonunless you force my hand, you black-hearted murderer. Im here
to take Dutch back to Carson with me. The yellow wolf shot my brother in
the back.

No such thing. I got him in a fair fight, blustered Dutch. An I
aint goin to Carson with you, either.

Youre going, _dead or alive_. McClintocks face and voice were as
inexorable as the day of judgment.

Hes aimin to take me there to be killed, Dutch cried out. You boys
wont stand for that. He named two or three of the men with whom he
consorted, picking them out of the crowd.

Sure we wont. A gunman stepped forward briskly. You cant pull that
over here, McClintock. You dont own this camp, an you cant play chief
here.

Two men lined up with Hugh, one on each side of him. The man on his
right was a whale of a fat man. Deftly he slid McClintocks revolver
from its holster. The second ally was a small wiry fellow. From a grimy
blackened face keen eyes peered intently.

The fat man spoke. Dont run on the rope, Sloan. Were with the kid on
this. Hes a deputy sheriff, an itll sure be Lets gather at the
river for some of you anxious gents if you overplay yore hand.

Sloan hesitated. He could not very well look round to see whether the
gang of which he was one were present in numbers, and, if so, whether
they would support him. He knew these three men of old. They belonged to
the pony express outfit, as hard-riding and fast shooting a group of men
as the West has known. It was certain that Dutch could not be rescued
without a fight, and Sloan was hardly in a position to call for a
showdown. He was game enough. With McClintock alone he would have taken
a chance. But the three of them were too many for him.

The sheriff of the county saved his face. He bustled forward.

Tut, tut! Whats all this? he asked fussily. Theres good law in this
town, lots of it. No need of gun plays. If Mr. Dutch is wanted, theres
a right an proper way to get him, but that way aint at the point of a
gun.

McClintocks a deputy sheriff, put in Budd.

There was rivalry between him and the sheriff. Budd was a candidate for
the party nomination at the coming primaries. The wise politicians
admitted that even with the Dodsons against him the fat man had a
chance.
