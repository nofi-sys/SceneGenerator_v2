Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
ANNE packed for a space, then gave it up. She couldnt go on with it,
she wanted to be down-stairs, not lose one minute of the last evening
at Gull Island. Her spirits, oppressed by Joes behavior, began to
bubble again, foam up in sparkling effervescence. You couldnt pack
clothes in a trunk when you felt like dancing and the hour was too
beautiful for belief and your lover might be waiting for you in the
garden. She slipped off her neglige and chose her most becoming dress,
leaf-green crpe that made her look slim as a reed and turned her skin
to ivory. She smoothed the black satin of her hair and hung round her
neck the chain of green beads she had bought for a dollar but youd
never guess it. And she figured in front of the glass, studying her
reflection this way and that, trying to see herself with new eyes and
judge if she was a girl a man might be proud of.

While thus engaged she heard the chug-chug of the launch. It must
be Joe going, and anxious to see the departure of that darkling and
uncomfortable spirit she went to the window. It looked out across the
slant of roofs that covered the kitchen wing and commanded a side-view
of the channel. Across the swift-sweeping current the boat came into
view, skimming forward like a home-faring bird. Anne leaned over the
sill, following it with startled eyes--where was Joe? There was Gabriel
in front at the wheel, but in the back--she stretched her neck trying
to see to the bottom of the cock-pit, there certainly was no one on the
seat.

Oh, _could_ he have missed it? she groaned and cast up her eyes as if
invoking the protection of Heaven against such a calamity.

But he couldnt have, he wanted to go, it was his holiday and he
thought Gull Island was a beastly hole. He must have been where she
couldnt see him. It was difficult to think where this might be--but
he _might_ have been bending down to put something in his suit-case.
A chair could have hidden him. She remembered what he had said about
leaving his baggage at the living-room entrance. If it was still there
then he had missed the boat and she ran down-stairs, hoping with a
prayerful earnestness that she would not find it. It was not there.
Then he _is_ gone, she said to herself with a satisfied nod and drew
a freer breath. The weight lifted, she went across to the garden where
she might find Bassett, and as she covered the space between the doors
the picture of the launch rose on her inner vision with Gabriel the
only visible occupant.

Bassett was not in the garden, but Shine was, sauntering into view from
the balcony end. Hed been loafing about he said, just come up from the
Point. Hed been all round it, wonderful down there now and going to
be more wonderful, and he pointed to a pale glow on the horizon where
the moon was rising. They strolled about on the lanes of turf between
the massed colors of parterre and border, the air languishingly sweet
with the scent of the closing flowers. Then they went in, luxuriously
embedding themselves in two vast armchairs. Bassett found them here
and tried to look genial at the sight of Shine. Hed been writing some
letters in his own room and he dropped into a third armchair with the
sigh of well-earned rest.

They talked about the moon and moonlight effects. Shine wanted to take
some photographs after supper, get the pines against the sea and the
silvered bulk of the Point, and he spoke of his flashlight picture
which theyd have as a remembrance of Gull Island. Anne said that was a
jolly idea, but she didnt think theyd need a picture to remind them
of their stay, and she and Bassett exchanged a smile.

It was still on their lips when a sound came from outside, a single
sharp detonation. It fell upon the evenings tranquil hush, sudden and
startling, like something alien and unrelated.

What was that? said Anne.

Sounds like a shot, Shine thought.

It couldnt be! Bassett got up. Nobody has a pistol here and if he
had he couldnt use it--one of the special stipulations Driscoll made
when he lent us the place.

He moved to the land entrance and looked out.

What could it have been? Anne looked questioningly at Shine, who,
having no other suggestion to offer, shrugged and shook his head.

The door of Mrs. Cornells room opened on the gallery and Miss Pinkney
emerged, Mrs. Cornell behind her.

Mr. Bassett, she cried, a hand on the railing. Wheres Mr. Bassett?

Bassett drew out from under the gallery and looked up at her:

Did you hear that?

I did and I told you that Mr. Driscoll never allowed any shooting on
the premises.
