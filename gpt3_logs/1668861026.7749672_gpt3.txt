SCENE:
With Gloria, with all of them, Alice knew that Kelsey had always been
alone. More alone, more horribly alone, than she had ever been. For
Kelsey had nothing inside of him to keep him company, or to sincerely
share with another.

He had no love in him.

She tried to comfort him, but he was on his knees, shivering and
whimpering. Then he tried to beat his way out through the door. She
pulled him back and he fell sobbing on the floor, squirming and rubbing
his hands and his face into the floor as though to get some feeling of
life from it.

The trembling of the walls and floor continued, very gently as though
even that was somehow being polite, as though even that was trying to
make things not so discomforting.

Kelsey was whining and sobbing. "I've got to get out--get out. There's
a shelter--a communal shelter. The project place--people--lots of
people--"

"All right," she said. "Let's take a chance, if you want to. We'll go
to that other shelter--with people in it."

But when they got to the top of the stairs and stepped into the living
room, the lights went on, the Tevee came to color-sound-life again.

The air-raid warning was over.

A smiling face materialized out of the wavery lines.

"The threat of the air-raid is over. Due to our wonderful cooperative
spirit, the enemy's cowardly attack accomplished little except the
minor destruction of a few scattered points. We're sure now that anyone
who has not ordered our Cozy-Corner Air-Raid Shelter will do so without
further delay! It comes equipped, remember, with three-dimensional
Tevee. There is the illusion of real people--"

Over fifty million air-raid shelters were sold within an hour.

But Alice wasn't concerned about that. She gave Kelsey a sedative
and put him to bed, and then she went to her dark closet and stood
in it until Wednesday morning. She had time to think about things,
and a wonderful calm came over her, and she knew she didn't care what
happened to her now. She was strong enough to live alone, and take
whatever was coming to her without fear.

When she shook Kelsey awake Wednesday morning and told him she was
Alice, he laughed, shocked and incredulous, trying to appear amused.
But she told him about the order blank, and convinced him she really
was Alice and Anita Starre did not exist.

He ran and called a robot repair clinic. He was almost incoherent,
trying to tell the clinic what had happened, but they finally
understood and said they would be right out to take the domestic away.

He seemed frightened as he looked at her.

"I don't understand," he said several times. "No one told you to do
such a thing. How could a robot just up and do such a thing?"

She started to answer, but didn't. There was nothing to say.

"Robots can become inefficient," Kelsey said. "They can wear down a
little and have to be repaired. But how could a robot just up and do a
thing like this?"

Because of loneliness and the need for love? She smiled. She could
smile now. It would have been funny for her to have said such a thing
as that.

She didn't care. She heard the jet-truck drop down by the curb outside
Kelsey's house. She heard the footsteps coming up the walk, onto the
porch. But she didn't care. She was strong enough not to care at all.

She cared not at all for any of them, Master Kelsey included. She
cared a little for Julian, for he had understood a little. But she
didn't care about any of the others now. They hardly existed! They had
nothing! In them, everything had been frozen forever and nothing really
moved inside.

They were empty, they were nothing, they didn't exist!

You saw the bright surfaces and the smiles as they walked and talked on
the street, and for a while you wanted to believe they existed, that
they were there. But they weren't really there at all.

She smiled and stood still and waited for them to move toward her. They
seemed afraid of her.
