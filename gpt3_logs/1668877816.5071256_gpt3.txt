Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
I get you, Nat returned. An if I see a geezer with a scar on the
left side of his face Ill let you know that, too. Mr. Manley had
told the story of the robbery to all the men on the X Bar X.

Roy and Teddy walked slowly over toward the corral.

How does the old head feel, Teddy? Roy asked.

Pretty good. Aches a little now and then. But Id rather have a
headache than an obituary notice. Roy, if you and dad hadnt gotten
there when you did, Id have had to be swept up with a shovel. A
slight shudder passed over the boy.

Forget it, Roy advised, laying a hand on his brothers shoulder.
Its over now. Say, Ive been thinking. I--

So have I, Teddy interrupted. About Flash, mostly. I miss him,
Roy. Miss him like anything! If I ever catch the thief who took
him--

I know, and Roy nodded. I feel the same about Star, and I guess
dad does about General, too. But we cant do any good thinking about
it. When the time comes, well act. The boys say that the gang who
rustled the cattle from the 8 X 8 is around again, and Ive still
got a hunch those are the waddies who stole our broncs. We just have
to sit tight, Teddy, and do a little figuring. In the meantime, Ive
got an idea that might interest you.

Lets hear it, Teddy suggested. Not about the broncs, is it?

No, Roy answered. Its about those two girls over at Pete Balls
place. Remember--Nell and Ethel?

Well, now that you speak about it, I do, Teddy drawled, with an
assumption of carelessness. Why?

Nothing, except that theyre coming over here.

They are? Teddy looked up with quick eagerness, then, as quickly,
turned away his head. Well, thatll be nice for you, Roy.

You dont say! his brother laughed. Nice for me, will it? How
about you?

Oh, I guess I can stand it. How long can they stay?

I notice you didnt ask when theyre going home, did you? Roy
asked. How long can they stay! Teddy, my boy, your innocence is
sublime. Well, mother telephoned to Mrs. Ball this morning, and I
guess theyll be here tonight or early tomorrow. Bug Eye will
probably bring them over.

The two boys had reached the corral, and Roy paused for a moment,
leaning against the rails. He peered at the horses within. Somehow,
the place did not seem the same without Star trotting over to nuzzle
his hand.

You mentioned something about rustlers at the 8 X 8, Teddy
remarked, as he examined the initials cut in one of the rails.

Yes. Dad heard from Eagles that they might be the same thieves who
stole Flash, Star, and General. Dont know who told him, but I
imagine it was one of the men who saw them ride our ponies away. You
know; the gang that hangs around the corral in town. Some of them
are pretty decent, and theyd help us if they could. Theres only a
certain bunch thats got it in for dad because he wouldnt go in for
that scheme of weighting the cattle scales, as Pop told us.

Teddy nodded.

I remember! Ill bet Checkered Shirt is one of them, too. Well,
lets get to work. You and I are going to ride fence, arent we?
Might as well get started. The better shape we keep the fence in,
the harder it will be for the rustlers to nab any of the X Bar X
stock, if theyre planning to do that. Golly, whats this country
coming to? They claim the old West is gone, but if some of those
birds who say that would come here, theyd soon find out! But we can
do without rustlers, if we have to, I guess.

Ill tell a maverick we can! Roy declared forcibly. If theyre
part of the old West, let em go. I wont keep em. Come on, grab a
bronc and lets be on our way.

It was almost dark when the two boys returned from their work of
repairing the fence. As they dismounted and led the horses to the
watering trough, a familiar noise greeted their ears. It was the
rattle of a flivver, above which sounded a voice.

Made it, ladies! Got this tin bronco ridin right along, didnt I?
Whoa! Grab a-holt, ladies, were goin to land, an theres no
tellin what shell do when she hits ground again! Yow! There she
is. Ho-o-o-old up now, you snortin peanut-roaster!


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with two boys, Roy and Teddy, walking slowly towards a corral. Roy asks Teddy how he is feeling, and Teddy says that he is feeling better but that he misses their horse, Flash. Roy says that he feels the same about his horse, Star, and that they just have to be patient and wait for the right time to take action.
Teddy then asks about the two girls that are coming to visit, and Roy tells him that they will be arriving soon. Teddy seems excited about the prospect of seeing the girls again, and the two boys make their way to the corral to start working.
As they are working, they hear the sound of a car approaching. They recognize the voice of the driver as Pete Ball, and they watch as he arrives with the two girls, Nell and Ethel.
The scene ends with the four of them talking and getting to know each other better.
