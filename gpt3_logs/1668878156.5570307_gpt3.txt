SCENE:
Listen, Jake. Ive known you for some years now. We aint never had
no argument before. Im sorry my dogies got over on yore land. But,
leapin turtles! thats no reason to come an take my head off about
it! Whynt you come up an tell me like a man, instead of raisin
the dust like a cyclone? Hey?

Jake Trummers face grew red. His neck swelled until the veins stood
out like knotted cords. His hands clenched.

Cause I didnt want to, thats why! he shouted. Think you can
run me like you run this here ranch, Bard Manley? Well, you cant!
When I says a thing I means it! You hear me! Them cattle of yours
been on my grass fer a week now. Every day I figures youll come
over an take em off, but you dont do nothin. So finally I has to
come over to you. But itll be the last time! You hear me! You get
them cows off Whirlpool River, or, by golly, Ill drive em _in_ the
river! You hear me!

Turning on his heel, Jake Trummer strode savagely to the corral rail
where he had tied his pony. Releasing her, he vaulted into the
saddle, swung the pintos head about, and galloped out of the yard.
Slowly Mr. Manley took a corncob pipe from his pocket, stuck it in
his mouth, applied a match to its already filled bowl, and then
grinned.

The old boy sure had his fur up, didnt he?

Ill tell a maverick he did, Roy responded. Then a frown came to
his face. Whats the rights of this, dad? When did Jake come over?
Had he been here long?

Not five minutes before you came. Teddy, you trot over and ask Nick
an Gus Tripp to come over here. I want to ask them some questions.
I didnt see no sense in lettin Jake Trummer have any say in how we
handle our men, so that was the reason I told Nick to go back
before. But to tell the truth-- he exhaled a great cloud of
smoke--to tell the truth, I thought Jake was foolin at first. But
I guess he was sure enough mad.

No doubt about that, Teddy added grimly. Ill get Nick for you,
Dad. Im sorry this happened. Jake has always been a good neighbor,
and I hate to have trouble with him. Shaking his head, the boy led
his horse to the hitching rail and then made for the other end of
the yard.

Takes it like a veteran, Mr. Manley remarked to Roy, as he watched
Teddy walk off. Roy-- and he placed a hand on his sons
shoulder--I never say much to you two, but I guess you know that
Im pretty well satisfied with who I got for youngsters. When the
time comes for me to take a back seat, I expect you an Teddy to
carry on this ranch like I did when I got it from my father--your
grandfather. You never saw him, but Pop Burns did. Hell tell you
all about him. An I tried to do the best I could by him--just like
you an Teddy are doin for me. You boys are men, now--yep, real
men. It took men to locate those rustlers the time we had our broncs
stole, and to round em up. It took men to ride at that cave in
Thunder Canyon to get Belle Ada an the rest without knowin how
many guns you were goin up against. Yep, it took men to do those
jobs--an you did em. I aint kickin none. Snakes! what started me
off on that trail? Son, you see any signs of Father Time around
here? and he squeezed Roys shoulder affectionately and laughed a
little.

Not any, Dad, Roy responded, and tried to echo his fathers laugh,
but there was a queer lump in his throat that he could not account
for. Never before had his father talked like this. And when Mr.
Manley saw his sons eyes, he understood. With a yell he grabbed Roy
about the waist and affected to throw him to the ground.

Could I do it? he grinned, desisting. You bet I could! Snakes,
Roy, youre too blame serious! What chance have you got to see me
take a back seat yet awhile and watch the grasshoppers whizzing by?
In the words of the immortal poet, not any! Where in thunder is
Teddy? Oh, here he comes!

With the arrival of Nick and Teddy, Roys mind turned from its
rather sombre trend to the business of ranching. Roy, but one year
older than Teddy, had a more serious disposition, frequently
considering events more important than they really were. This nature
he inherited from his mother, who, before her marriage to Bardwell
Manley, had been a school teacher in Denver. From her Roy got his
taste for the really worthwhile things in life--poetry, literature,
pictures. But the fact that these tendencies showed early
development occasioned Teddy, who as yet was quite Roys opposite,
much amusement.

As Nick Looker approached, Mr. Manleys face took on a frown.

Hear the news, Nick? he asked shortly.
