SCENE:
Ah Herr Topham! Well found, my friend. You have quite recovered from
the affair on the train?

Oh! Quite! And you?

But yes! I hope you have suffered no inconvenience from the loss of
your papers? The Brazilians tones were light, but Topham thought he
read a note of anxiety in them.

Very little, he replied. They were only of sentimental value, Count!

Count! The other smiled. Ah! Ha! You know. My good friend Rutile has
told you? Yes! I am count. But I seldom use the title. I fly higher.
Perhaps you have heard.

Topham nodded, and the Brazilian rattled on. Boni! he exclaimed. I
have good news. Come and rejoice with me. As you Americans say, come
and smile with me. He caught Walter by the arm and drew him down the
walk to the tables beneath the trees.

Topham went willingly enough. Despite the warning of the Gazette
correspondent, he rather liked Ouro Preto. Besides, he was the brother
of the Countess Elsa.

Ouro Preto picked out a table and beckoned to a waiter. What will
you have, my friend, he demanded, as he dropped into his chair. The
gin-rickey or the horses-neck or the mint-julep of America; the wine
of France; or the beer of Germany?

Anything, so long as its beer, returned Topham, lightly. But,
Count, whats your good news?

The best ever. You know what it is I want in Berlin? Yes? Well, the
Emperor will see me tomorrow at ten.

Walter caught up the stein which the swift-footed waiter had placed
before him. Congratulations! he cried, and gulped the beer.

Ouro Preto nodded. His eyes were bright with excitement, and his dark
cheeks burned with color. That argues much, eh? friend Topham? he
questioned. Wilhelm does not see a man in private audience unless he
has something to say to him. If he meant to refuse, he could do so by
proxy. That he consents to see me means--means--well, I scarcely dare
guess what it may mean.

Walter played with his stein. Im not familiar with the Emperors
ways, he observed, But to be received in private audience seems a
mighty good augury.

Ouro Preto sipped his beer slowly. Its great, he cried. It must
mean something. And yet you can never tell. Obstacles arise out of
nothing. There are so many interlocking interests over here. One
touches a Frenchman and a Russian suddenly springs up in his way. One
whispers a secret to an Italian, and the next day an Englishman greets
him with it. You Americans are happy to stand aside from all this. As
the great Washington said, you have no entangling alliances. You need
no diplomacy. But here--here every man must be a diplomat and must
intrigue. It is of a necessity.

The Brazilian raised his stick and beckoned again to the waiter. Zwei
bier, he ordered. While he waited, he gazed round at the near-by
tables, scanning their occupants one by one, as if to single out any
who might be watching.

Those at the tables were sufficiently diverse. At one table a
couple of Englishmen were drinking gin; at another the members of
a party, conspicuously American, were laughing guiltily as they
tasted unaccustomed wine; beyond two or three Italians were making
a tremendous noise over a bottle of vin ordinaire; close at hand an
unescorted lady, apparently French, was sipping a glass of champagne.

The count seemed satisfied with the results of his scrutiny, for he
turned to Topham with a smile. Only the usual set, he observed, At
least, so far as I can see. Probably I alarm myself needlessly. So far
as I know, it is to no ones interest to oppose me. You can think of no
one, eh! my friend?

I? Topham stared at the man in surprise. Of course not. I didnt
know till today what you were after; and certainly I have never heard
anyone suggest any opposition. Why should they?

The Brazilian laughed. Why should they, indeed? he answered, lightly.
He broke off, and Topham saw that he was watching some one.

The swish of a skirt just behind his chair and a faint perfume that
stole upon his senses warned the American not to look around too
suddenly. When he did manage to turn with sufficient casualness, he saw
two ladies and a gentleman taking their seats at a vacant table a few
feet away. The mans face was toward him and he recognized him at once.
The girls backs were turned, but something familiar in the pose of one
of them set his heart to thumping.
