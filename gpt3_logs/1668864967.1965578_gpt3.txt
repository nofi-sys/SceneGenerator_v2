What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Once for all, exclaimed Mr Crampton, bringing down his broad fist
heavily upon the table, once for all, I tell you, _I will not have
it_.

At this terrible assertion, Mrs Crampton shivered as if she had been
struck, and Aunt Clem silently dissolved into tears. Henry Hindes, of
all the party, alone preserved his composure. He leaned back in his
chair, carefully trimming his filbert nails with a penknife, as if the
affair under discussion were not of the slightest moment.

Of course you will not have it, he said after a pause to Mr Crampton,
no man in his senses would. Mr Frederick Walcheren has money and good
looks, but there his claims to admiration end. The first you do not
require for your daughter, and the second would have no weight with
anyone but a woman. To place against these supposed advantages, Mr
Walcheren is a young man of dissolute habits, and lavish expenditure.
You should hear what his cousin, Philip Walcheren, says of him.

I want no ones opinion but my own, replied Mr Crampton vehemently.
Jenny will have all my money by-and-by, and she shall marry no man
that will make ducks and drakes of it. Besides, he isnt good enough
for her in any way. He thinks, I suppose, because his family have been
a set of idle scoundrels for centuries past, while my progenitors have
been working to support their children, that his is the better of the
two, but I dont see it. Besides, if he were the heir to the Crown,
he shouldnt have my daughter. Hes a Roman, thats more than enough
for me. Ill have no Papists in my family. I hate the whole crew, with
their cunning, underhand ways. If Jenny wont give this Walcheren
fellow over, Ill lock her up on bread and water till she comes to her
senses again.

As neither of the ladies made any answer to this threat, Mr Hindes
interfered again.

Surely, he said with an incredulous smile, Miss Crampton will not
dream of opposing your wishes in this particular, when so much depends
upon her obedience. What can she see in this young man to attract her,
above others of his kind; she who has a crowd of admirers wherever she
goes, and is the acknowledged beauty of Hampstead? I believe, Crampton,
that you are alarming yourself without cause. Miss Crampton means
nothing serious. She is merely amusing herself with the sight of young
Walcherens infatuation for her.

Its more than that, returned the older man; Ive forbidden the
girl to dance with him when she meets him out, or to receive him here
during my absence. And now, her mother tells me, she met them riding
together yesterday afternoon, and has intercepted a letter from him
to Jenny, in which he writes as though they were promised to each
other. What am I to do? I cant be always at my daughters elbow, and
her mother cant go galloping all over the country after her. It is
disgraceful to think that a young lady of twenty cant be trusted to
behave herself properly as soon as she is out of her parents sight!

Dont you think you are making rather a mountain out of a molehill?
inquired Henry Hindes, in the same calm way. Doubtless, Miss Crampton
is young and thoughtless, and, if I may venture to say so--perhaps just
a wee bit spoilt; but is that any reason that you should suspect her
of impropriety? And, after all, is there anything wrong or unusual in
a lovely girl being followed and persecuted by her admirers? Perhaps,
if the truth were known, Miss Crampton might be as well pleased to get
rid of Mr Walcheren as you would be.

At this juncture, Mrs Crampton took heart of grace to put in her oar.

Oh, thank you, dear Mr Hindes! she exclaimed. I am sure you are
right. That is, I feel certain that Jenny cares no more for Mr
Walcheren than for anyone else. She is a trifle wilful and does not
brook contradiction well--I acknowledge that--and perhaps papa and I
have spoilt her a little; she is such a darling, you know, that it is
very difficult not to spoil her--but she would never really oppose our
wishes. Papa has only to speak to her--

Nonsense! interposed Mr Crampton gruffly. I have spoken to her a
dozen times already, and she laughs in my face and disobeys me as soon
as my back is turned. But this business has gone far enough, and I mean
to put a stop to it. Where is the girl? he continued, turning to his
wife; go and tell her I wish to speak to her at once!

My dear, she has not risen yet. I do not suppose she is awake!

And it is past eleven, said her husband.

Yes; but remember how late she was up last night. I dont think we
were home till past two oclock.

Whilst she was dancing with this young jackanapes, I conclude, and
letting him make eyes at her! Well! it is for the last time, I can tell
Miss Jenny that! If she disobeys me again, Ill take her right away
from Hampstead, and she shall never see it till the fellows dead, or
married. No Papistical grandchildren for me! I can tell her that!


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Mr. Crampton and his daughter Jenny over her relationship with Frederick Walcheren. Mr. Crampton is determined to end the relationship because he feels that Walcheren is not good enough for Jenny and is only after her money. Jenny is equally determined to continue the relationship, despite her father's wishes. This conflict will drive the rest of the story.
