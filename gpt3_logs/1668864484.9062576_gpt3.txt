SCENE:
Ive got to stop her! She shant smoke here in my shop. What would
mother say? she thought breathlessly to herself, trying to control
the tremor that ran through her hands, so that she might set even
stitches in her work. Ive _got_ to stop her! Its my shop. Shes got
no business to smoke here. Why, I wouldnt let my best friend smoke
here! But though she protested these things to herself, Julie could
not whip her courage up to bringing them forth in spoken words, and
Elizabeth continued to puff out long blue columns of smoke, watching
them with satisfaction, while with an affected gesture, she flecked
her ashes here and there over the clean floor. She was in truth a
little disappointed that her cigarette had provoked no comment. She
had expected Julie at least to look startled, and was prepared to
defend herself with condescending patronage. Julies silence was
disconcerting, for Elizabeth possessed none of the spiritual antenn
with which to sense anothers atmosphere if unexpressed by word or
gesture. She strolled back to the mirror, and under cover of patting
her hair into place peeped at Julies reflection to see if she was
being watched from behind her back. But Julie, whose weakness it was
to have antenn far too sensitive to anothers atmosphere, knew what
Elizabeth expected, and kept her eyes resolutely upon the threading of
her needle. It was a little defiant clash between the two women, of
which Julie was fully aware, but which Elizabeth realized only from her
own standpoint.

At this moment Aunt Sadie Johnson bustled into the shop, and having
none of Julies delicate hesitancy, exploded the hidden situation with
a startled exclamation.

Julie, she began, I just ran in to see if that white ruchin I
got you to order for me--Well, for the _mercy sake_! she broke off,
suddenly catching sight of Elizabeth. Well, my lands! she continued,
staring frankly, and unafraid of drawing upon herself the full fire of
the cigarette.

It was some such violent attention as this that Elizabeth had hoped for.

Whats the matter? she inquired in her most superior manner. Oh,
feigning surprise, my cigarette? Why surely, Mrs. Johnson, Im not the
first woman youve seen smoke.

That you aint! Aunt Sadie retorted promptly. Ive seen a plenty of
em do it.

Elizabeth was somewhat dashed, but she rallied as best she could.
Well, she said, Im glad Harts Run aint such a back number as not
to know that all the smart women smoke nowadays.

Smart? Aunt Sadie cried, and went off into billows of large mirth.
Well, you may call em smart, but I dunnos they look so stylish to
me. Theres old Betty Willets from off Rocky Ridge. She drives her old
wagon an broken-down horse into town, to collect the swill from folks
backyards to take up to her hog. Shes one of our smart smokers. An
they all smoke up Spitzers Holler--an chew too--theyre bout the
lowest-down lot of folks we have round here. Oh, no, you aint the
first Ive seen smoke, not by a long sight. But it does look like a
pity for a right young woman like you to be smoking and chewin--itll
just ruin your teeth.

Chew? cried Elizabeth wildly. You dont think I chew tobacco, do
you?

Oh, dont tell me! Aunt Sadie returned. I never saw a woman yet who
smoked, that she didnt chew on the sly an dip snuff, too. Oh, Id be
the last person in the world to say there was any real harm in it, she
went on tolerantly, with so many of our old folks still doin it; its
only that I always did think chewin an spittin--

I dont chew! Elizabeth cried furiously. Of course I dont! Who ever
heard of such a thing? Well, Im going, she announced, flouncing to
the door. An Ill say this, Miss Rose, she added, I dont think
_youre_ any too polite either to strangers. In all the time Ive been
here, youve hardly said two words, and you havent so much as asked me
to take a chair. Angry tears leaped in her eyes, and she flung herself
away out of the shop and up her own stairs.

Well, the poor thing, Mrs. Johnson said. I made her mad all right! I
reckon it was a sin, but I just couldnt stand her airing round here
with that cigarette, an showings off to us moss-backs. Whatd you let
her smoke in here for, Julie? You know your mother wouldnt have liked
it.

I didnt know how to stop her, Julie confessed helplessly.

Well, I stopped her all right! Aunt Sadie returned, shaken again by
large laughter. But aint the world funny, Julie? Here weve all come
to look down on smokin, and feel sort of ashamed of the old women that
still do it, when along comes all the young smart Alecks, an says its
the thing to do, an if you dont do it, it just shows youre right
from the backwoods. Now aint that funny? If you just live long enough
in the world, youll see everything turned upside down! But I feel kind
of sorry for poor Mis Bixby, she added tolerantly.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is light-hearted and humorous. The tone is set by Aunt Sadie's comical description of the "smart Alecks" who have taken up smoking, and the dialogue between the two women is banterous and good-natured. The point of view is third person limited, focused on Julie's perspective.
