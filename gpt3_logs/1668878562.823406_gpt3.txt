SCENE:
Jules Kolto started. He staggered to his feet, trembling.

Sister! he cried, and opened his arms to the girl.

Jules! She rushed to him, sobbing and laughing at the same time.
Jules! You here? Oh, Jules, I thought Id never see you again!

Gus stood as though turned to stone.

What--what-- he stammered.

Oh, Gus, this is my brother! the blushing young wife cried, and
running to him pulled him forward by the hand. My brother, Gus!
Dont you understand?

Well, not very good-- Gus muttered, then his face cleared and he
thrust out his hand. Joe, he said, I dont know what this is all
about, but if shes yore sister, shake! Were brother-in-laws.

Brothers-in-law, Bug Eye corrected. The plural here takes the
possessive case.

Gus, Mr. Manley said haltingly, so yore back? Son, Im glad! Put
er there! Im sorry I--

Boss! Gus interrupted, you neednt be sorry for nothin. It was
all my fault--the whole blame thing. But, boss, see what it got
me--aint she a beauty? And he looked at his wife proudly.

She sure is, Gus! Now lets get this thing straight. Nick
Looker--where is that bowlegged wild man? Whered you find Gus,
Nick?

He wandered back two days after Teddy an Roy left, Nick chuckled.
Hed been all the way to Togas, Mexico, an got married--You tell
it, Gus!

Well, boss, it was this way, Gus began, as he gripped an arm of
Teddy and Roy affectionately. You know I was worried about not
gettin no letters from the lady here--I mean my wife, and he
blushed. You know, Teddy--I told you about it. Gee, aint it funny
to have a wife? Well, she didnt write for a long time, so I got
worried, an started to--do some things I shouldnt. I thought shed
threw me down.

But, Gus, I did write, every day! his wife interrupted.

Sure she did! Nick burst out. Gus, that dumb postmaster down at
Eagles mislaid the letters! I got em now in my bunk--a whole raft
of em!

You have? Well, Im a ring-tailed doodle bird! Gus said slowly,
and sat down. An I went an got sick, almost, with worry, an let
the cattle stray cause I went to town an got drunk, an all this
happened because the postmaster lost my letters!
Can--you--beat--that?

Golly, Teddy, hes right! Roy exclaimed. Snakes, its just like a
story! We went up Whirlpool River--got tipped over--found The
Pup--had the fight with the rustlers--everything--all on account of
some missing letters! Golly, thats funny! If Gus had gotten those
letters he never would have neglected the cattle, would you, Gus?

Nope, not me! I hardly knew what I was doin, I was so worried. I
thought you was dead, or somethin, and he felt bashfully for his
wifes hand. When he caught it, after not much trouble, he went on:

An thats the way it was. So I heads fer Togas, after the boss
lets me out, an goes straight fer the little girl here. So we gets
hitched an come home!

You did come _home_, Gus, Mr. Manley murmured. This is your home
from now on!

Oh, Dad, isnt this too romantic for words! Belle Ada burst out.
And all this happened because the letters Mrs. Tripp sent were
mislaid! But, Gus, didnt you know your wife was Joe Marinos
sister? she asked, her eyes wide.

Nope! Thats one too many for me, even now. His names Marino, an
hers is--I mean was--Kolto. I dont see--

Gus, if you do any more thinkin youll get a headache! Mr. Manley
exclaimed, laughing loudly. Then he clapped his re-engaged cowboy on
the back. Pull up that chair an dive into this here roast chicken!
Now, boys, Ill drink that toast I started--heres to Mr. and Mrs.
Tripp. May they live long an happy an never have more than one
scrap a day!

Bardwell! Mrs. Manley chided, and smiled. Im sure Gus and his
wife wont have one single dispute as long as theyre married!
