SCENE:
Oh, that road, the man said. Im not so sure.

But you said it was only twenty miles.

Did I? Hell. Well, its more than that. But I suppose you might reach
it. Yes, if youre not lamed or crocked or ill you ought to reach it.

And can you let me take some food and water?

Youd better not take those here: youll only have to lug them along.
No. Well stop at another settlement, some miles from here, and get a
swag and a gooby for you there. Then you wont have so much to carry.
But here is Chug-chug with the chow. I always have chocolate,
Spanish-fashion here, for breakfast. A man has to be pretty hard up to
drink mat in cold blood. Id as soon drink swipes at a wedding.

After breakfast, the man suggested that they should start. He had his
sporting rifle under his arm and his bandolier buckled to him. Hi kept
his eyes from resting on the letters D. W. so plainly stamped upon them.
He had taken pains to avoid any reference to D. W. He wondered, as they
set out, whether he would not come to know the contents of that rifle
during the course of the morning. He wondered whether that was why the
man had dissuaded him from taking food and drink. Naturally, if Im
going to be shot, he thought, he wont want to waste food and drink as
well as a cartridge. But am I going to be shot? Does he intend to kill
me? How am I to dodge it, if he does? I cant refuse to go with him.
That would bring things to a crisis at once. I must go with him, and
look alive and trust to my luck. The worse I expect, the better I shall
find.

The man led the way out of the village, across the river, where the
Indians were bathing, to a narrow path through a cane-brake. The set of
the path was to the south and west, which Hi knew could not be the
course for Santa Barbara.

This cant be the way, Hi said. Santa Barbara must be north and east
of this.

Of course it is, the man said. But this is the way. It swings north
after a bit, but anyway you have to go west first of all, to clear the
marshes. All the mountain water which isnt soaked up by the trees seeps
out at the foothills and makes marsh. Youd better let me lead you.

Lead the way, then, said Hi. Its jolly good of you to trouble. He
thought that at any rate it was jolly good to have the man with the gun
in front of him. The path was a well-trodden, very narrow Indian track,
running irregularly between walls of high growing canes, which glittered
and rattled. They had hard golden shafts from which pale sheaths, like
corn-husks, peeled. High up, seven feet above his head, their shoots
were bluish or seemed bluish from the sky above; while the sky in the
narrow gash above was greenish from their yellowness. The path curved in
and out, exactly as the leader of the tribe had swerved from snag or
snake long years before, when the Indians had first gone that way. It
was impossible to keep direction after the first few minutes. The most
that Hi could say was that he never headed to the east, because he never
had the sun in his eyes.

Well keep forest habits, going, the man said. Well not speak on the
trail.

Hi was much relieved at not having to talk. He watched the mans back in
front of him, going on and on with the head down. What is the brute
thinking? Hi wondered. How soon he shall turn round and bowl me over?
Or what a neat job he made of Wigmore and how it can be bettered? Or is
he debating whether Im too much of a kid to bother about? As to that, I
wouldnt mind betting that hes made up his mind to do for me. The
question is, when?

That was the main question; but the other questions were not answered,
they recurred continually, the question, Will he? and the other
question, What can I do to stop him?

There seemed to be no likely way of stopping him. His mind was working
very clearly and weighing all likely chances. The man was armed; he was
carrying his rifle at the ready. He was a quick man, probably trained by
years in the forest to wheel and make snapshots suddenly. He was a
strong man, much stronger certainly than Hi. If Hi were to dart in upon
him, to seize the gun, he would certainly settle Hi without trouble;
being stronger, quite as active, much more dangerous, and in better
condition. If Hi were to lag behind a little and then turn and run back,
he would only run to this mans village, where no one could direct him
to safety, and all would tell which way he had taken. If he were to leap
to the side into the cane-brake, he might be lucky; he might by some
miracle leap into cover which would hide him: far more probably he would
at the first spring land in some thicket which would hold him, like
another Absalom, till his enemy could deal with him. Even if he were not
shot in the first minutes he would still be alone in the bush, lost, not
knowing his whereabouts nor his course. He might wander for days there
without finding a way out.
