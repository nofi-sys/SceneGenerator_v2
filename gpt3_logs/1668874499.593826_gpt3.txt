SCENE:
I want you to tell the truth. Rowan would in your place. Hed never let
women and children suffer for his wrongdoing. I dont think you would if
you thought of it.

Youre wastin yore breath, he told her sulkily.

I wish you could see Missie Yerby and her little boy. They get along
somehow because the neighbours help with the cattle. She doesnt
complain. Shes brave. But she does miss Sam dreadfully. So does the
little boy. Hes a nice manly little chap, but he needs a father. It
isnt right that he shouldnt have one. He often asks when his dad is
coming home.

I aint keepin him here, he growled.

And Mrs. Rogers will be an old woman soon if Brad doesnt get out. I
can see her fading away. It seems to me that if I could help them by
saying a few words, by just telling the truth, that it would give me
pleasure to make them happy.

Different here, he snarled. Its every one for himself.

That isnt what you told me that day at Wagon Wheel, she said quietly.

All right. Ive changed my mind. Let it go at that.

Kate is still waiting for Jack Cole. She wont look at any other man.

Makes no difference to me if she waits till Kingdom Come.

Thats three women who are unhappy, and Jacks mother is another, and
Im the fifth. Five women and two children you could make glad by
confessing that you started the shooting and killed Mr. Gilroy. Not many
men have an opportunity like that. We would bless you in our prayers,
Mr. Falkner.

Keep right on soft-soapin me. See where it gets you, he taunted.

She ignored his retort.

Wed do more for you than that. Wed all work for your pardon, too.
Wed show how Joe Tait had beaten you up when you hadnt a chance and
how quarrelsome he was. Pretty soon wed get you out, too.

The hell you would! Dont I know? Id stand the gaff for all of em.
Aint I doing it now? Rowans out somewheres bossin a road gang. Rogers
is in the wardens office. Sam Yerby putters around the garden. An
meI live in that damned dark hole alone. Theyre wardens little pets.
Im the one that gets the whip. By God, if I ever get a chance at one of
these slave-drivers

He broke off, to grind his teeth in a fury of impotent rage.

Dont! Dont feel that way, she begged. You get all the worst of it.
Dont you see you do? And it makes you unhappy. Let me tell the warden
that youll try not to break the prison rules. It would be so much
better for you.

Tell him Ill cut his black heart out if I ever get a chance.

She was appalled at his venomous hatred. Vaguely she knew that prison
discipline was often harsh. Occasionally some echo of it crept into
newspapers. Falkner was refractory and undisciplined. No doubt he had
broken rules and been insubordinate. It came to her that there had been
some contest of stubborn will between this lawless convict and the
guards who had charge of him. His face was scarred with wounds not yet
healed. She did not know that ridges crossed and recrossed his back
where the lash had cut away the skin with cruel strokes which had burned
like fire. But she did know that he was untamed and unbroken, that
nothing short of death could make that wild spirit quail before his
tormentors.

I wish I could help you, she said. But I cant. All I can do is ask
you to help me. Wont you think about it, please? I know youre a man.
Youre not afraid to take the blame that belongs to you. If you could
only see this straight, the way you would see it if you were outdoors in
the hills, I know you would help me.

I dont need to think about it. Im playin my own hand.

The governor says that if I can get any evidence, any proof that Rowan
did not start the shooting or kill Gilroy, he will give him a pardon. It
lies with you, Mr. Falkner.

Well, Ive done given you my answer. Im for myself, an for nobody
else. Thas the bed rock of it.

For Rowans freedom Ruth would have gone a long way. She had humbled
herself to plead with the convict. But she had known it would be
useless. His environment had so deadened his moral sense, so numbed his
sympathy, that she could strike no response from him. When she left the
prison it was with the knowledge that she had not advanced her husbands
cause one whit.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The literary style of this scene is harsh and unyielding. There is a sense of hopelessness and despair throughout, as Ruth tries unsuccessfully to appeal to Falkner's better nature. The tone is one of frustration and anger, with a hint of desperation. The point of view is limited omniscient, with the focus on Ruth's perspective.
