SCENE:
XIX.

THE CAPITULATION.


In the room of a farm-house in the American lines near Saratoga, a
large gathering of officers was assembled. The scarlet of the British,
the dark green of the Hessian, and the homely blue and buff of the
American officers, mingled in friendly union for the first time.

The British officers looked gloomy and depressed, while the Americans
treated them with marked courtesy and consideration. A carriage rolled
up to the door of the farm-house, attended by a single dragoon, and a
lady with two little children was helped out by one of the American
officers, whose plain uniform bore no distinctive marks of rank.

This same officer had a peculiarly kind and benevolent expression on
his face. He took up the frightened little ones in his arms as readily
as if he had been their proper parent, kissed them affectionately,
and turned to welcome the mother, with all the kindly courtesy of a
gentleman of the old school.

The lady was the Baroness Reidesel, wife of the Hessian commander, and
her heart was at once won to the kind stranger.

Oh, sir, she said, impulsively, you are very, very kind, to us who
have injured you so much.

Dear madam, said the stranger, that was but the fortune of war.
You are trembling. Do not be alarmed, I pray you. Probably it may
be somewhat embarrassing to you to be the only lady in such a large
company of gentlemen. Pray let me take you and the children to my tent,
where I will try to entertain you as best I can.

The tears rushed to the eyes of the lady, as she said:

Oh, sir, you must be a husband and father to show me so much kindness.
Tell me only to whom I am indebted.

The debt is mine, madam, said the officer, politely. I am General
Schuyler.

And indeed it was that noblest of all heroes of the Revolution, after
Washington, the General to whose genius the capture of Burgoyne was
owing, and who was yet superseded in the hour of his triumph by the
intrigues of the unscrupulous Gates, around whose brows the laurels
were placed that really belonged to Schuyler. The baroness in her
memories has left us this little incident, illustrative of the real
nobility of the man.

In Schuylers tent, in which the baroness soon found herself, she was
greeted with respectful cordiality by a young lady, one of the most
beautiful creatures she had ever seen, who was introduced to her by the
General as Mademoiselle Diane de Cavannes, the betrothed wife of my
cousin, Captain Schuyler.

Sitting down to dinner, the baroness was soon after introduced to
a remarkably handsome young officer of hussars, as the cousin in
question, who entered while they were at table.

The conversation was carried on indifferently in English, German,
and French, for every one at table seemed to be a good linguist, and
before half an hour had passed the baroness felt as happy as if she had
been among intimate friends instead of being, as she really was in an
enemys camp, her husband and all his army prisoners.

While they were still at table, however, an incident occurred which
showed that war was not at rest entirely.

A disturbance was heard outside, some shouting, the reports of two
muskets, followed by the gallop of a horse near the tent.

Adrian Schuyler jumped up, at a signal from the General, and went
out to see what was the matter. The baroness full of vague fears, as
was natural to a lady in her lonely position, remained silent and
absent minded, in spite of the assiduous attentions of her host and
Mademoiselle de Cavannes to continue the conversation.

It was not long however before she was reassured by the entrance of
Adrian, who was accompanied by Baron Reidesel himself.

Ah, _mon ami_, exclaimed the anxious wife, I feared some terrible
thing had happened to thee.

The baron, after bowing to General Schuyler, whom he seemed to know,
explained the disturbance in a few words.

It seemed that Burgoyne and his principal officers had been dining with
Gates and his staff, and that all were somewhat the worse for wine, as
was common in those days of hard drinking.
