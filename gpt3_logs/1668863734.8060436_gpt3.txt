Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Then Cartier got up and walked away from Jean; he could not bear to see
the boys face.

It is not true, muttered Jean, it is not true! but he did not get
up and go after Cartier.

For a long while neither of the two men spoke. Then Cartier said:

I wish youd come with me to Russia, Jean; its the best place for you
to get the taste of Paris out of your mouth! Paris is like this! You
wont get on here. You dont understand her little ways. You think of
things as if they were made of jewels; theyre not: theyre made, for
the most part, of paste. When one knows that one pays the price for
paste, but to pay as you do is to be ruined.

To tell the truth I had no idea how far things had gone. I believed it
was only a case of the occasional bleeding of the rich--that one winks
at oneself--it relieves the system, as it were--and at the same time
there is always a profit for the anmic. Torialli is a good fellow, he
wouldnt want more than that; but shes ambitious--shes gone, even
for Paris, a little far. Still, if I were you, Id get that account of
Margots paid. I wouldnt fight her!

Fight her! muttered Jean. _Mon Dieu!_ fight Gabrielle!

Dont think of her like that! cried Cartier sharply, or youll go
mad. Think of her as she is, a clever _intrigante_, with her hand in
the pocket of the public.

The Devil! cried Jean, springing to his feet. Dont push me too far,
Cartier. Ive stood a good deal because I suppose you believe what you
say---- Jean stopped.

Cartier nodded. You, too, he said quietly, believe what I say.
Youre at liberty to knock me down if itll relieve you. After all, I
let you in for this thing. Only keep hold of the truth. Madame Torialli
isnt worth breaking a stick for, let alone a mans life! Youve got
talent, my boy,--pull yourself together and use it. You happen to have
seen a good woman, even though you havent, I fancy, looked at her.
Still, they exist, you know, and will continue to, but theyre not as a
rule quite as clever as Madame. Well go to Russia next week if youre
ready.

Jean made no answer; he hunted blindly for his hat, found it, and
rushed out into the street.

It was a stifling May night; the hot air from the pavement rose
up to meet the sultry breath of the sky. Jean did not feel it, it
even seemed to him to be cold. He knew nothing, and saw nothing. A
merciful blankness had descended upon his mind. He had this much of
an idea--that he must go--but he was not sure where, or how. When he
crossed a street he passed through the traffic as if it were something
flung upon a screen. People shouted after him, but he paid no attention
to their cries. He did not dream of committing suicide, he did not feel
as if there was anything as real as suicide. He neither knew nor cared
where he went, though he was conscious of a feeling of ease as the hard
glare of the Champs lyses melted into the softer darkness of the Bois.

There were trees now, and whole empty spaces where the little figures
of men and women ceased to jerk past him like childrens painted toys.

By and by he came to a seat in the shadow of a big tree. It was quite
dark and empty and Jean huddled there, cowering beside it as if it
could afford him some kind of shelter against a special danger. He knew
now that he was afraid. There was still something that might happen to
him. He might remember Gabrielles face.

The birds twittered and murmured to each other in the trees, the
far-off voice of Paris came lightly to Jean, without the menace of its
accustomed speed. He tried to think of Margot and picture what she was
doing, but something quickly warned him not to do that. If he thought
of Margot he might remember what he was trying to forget; and then it
came; though he had shut his eyes and covered his face with his hands
he saw her. He saw Gabrielles face.

She was smiling at him as she had smiled last night with serene and
intimate tenderness.

The merciful blankness was over now, pain poured into him, pain so
abominable and heart-rending that he cried aloud. He could not bear it.
He must not bear it, it was as physical as scorching flame. He saw the
way she moved, her dresses and the crystal heart she wore and played
with in her delicate hands.

The birds were quiet now, but it was no longer any use their being
quiet. He heard instead every tone of her delicious voice, its little
soft falls into contralto like the depth of velvet, or its sudden
lifting into clear, sweet notes like the chiming of a silver bell. She
was horribly near him, the night was full of her, he could even breathe
the exquisite faint perfume of her hair.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Jean is in pain after Cartier tells him the truth about Gabrielle. He tries to forget her, but he cannot. He sees her face and hears her voice everywhere.
