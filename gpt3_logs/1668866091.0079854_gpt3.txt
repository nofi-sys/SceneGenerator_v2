SCENE:
Id rather see some deer. Harold remarked.

Well all I ask, Laura was very emphatic, is not to see two
people--Silva and Tyma Burle.

I dont think well run into them, Maida declared thoughtfully, Its
a long time since any of us have seen them--over two weeks I should
say. Perhaps theyve gone away.

No, Arthur called from his canoe, I saw them in the village
yesterday.

The landing was effected with no difficulty, although here of course
there was no pier. They followed the trail through the woods for a long
way, trying to find a place to camp. One spot attracted some; a second
attracted others; but for a long time, no place attracted them all.

There are too many stones here, Rosie would say, it wont be
comfortable to sit down.

And its too sunny here, Maida commented. Itll melt the ice cream
and the butter--and everything.

That place slants, Laura made the third objection, we want a nice
flat spot.

I think I hear water, Dicky cried suddenly.

Water! Maida repeated, Water! How can you hear it? Theres no water
here. I never saw any brook around here. I cant hear any water.

Neither could anybody else; yet Dicky persisted that he heard the sound
of running water.

You wait here, he exclaimed suddenly, let me see if I can find it.
He disappeared through the trees. He came running back in a few minutes
obviously excited. I havent found it yet, he explained, but I
certainly hear it plainer and plainer the farther I go.

The others swarmed into the bushes. Dicky led the way like a little
human divining rod.

I hear water, Rosie announced electrically. Hark!

They all stopped and listened. One by one they got the soft tinkle.
Encouraged they kept on, rounding bushes and leaping rocks. The noise
grew louder and louder. A rough trail suddenly appeared. They raced
over it as fast as their burdens would permit. The sound was now a
lovely musical splash. They came out on an open space, surrounded by
pines and thickly carpeted with pine needles. At one side a great rock
thrust out of the earth. Close beside it ran a tiny brook and just
beyond the lee of the rock, the brook fell into a waterfall not more
than a foot high. The children went wild with delight.

Do you mean to tell me, Maida Westabrook, that you never knew this was
here? Rosie demanded.

I never did, Maida declared solemnly. I have never seen it. I have
never heard anybody mention it. Isnt it a darling? What shall we call
it? We must give it a name.

Nobody had any names ready and everybody was too excited to think. In
fact, at once they began wading up and down the little brook. They
explored the neighborhood. Not far off they came upon a curious patch
of country. A cleared circle, surrounded by pine trees and carpeted
with pines, was filled with irregular lines of great rocks that lost
themselves in the bushes on either side.

I believe this is a moraine, Maida exclaimed suddenly. Ive seen
moraines in Europe.

Whats a moraine? the others asked.

Maida explained how once the earth had been covered with great
icecaps called glaciers and how in melting these glaciers had often
left--streaking the earths surface--great files and lines of rock.
Well ask father to come here some day, she ended. Hell know all
about it. Billy Potter too--he knows everything.

After a while, they came back to the waterfall. They swept aside the
pine needles; spread the tablecloth on the ground; took food from the
baskets; set it about in an inviting pile. The ice cream had not melted
an atom in the freezer. The sandwiches, done up in wet napkins, were
quite fresh. The eggs looked as inviting as hard-boiled eggs are bound
to look. Everything was all right except that--and this produced first
consternation, then laughter--there was no salt.

We all reminded everybody else to remember the salt, Maida said in
disgust, and so nobody put it in the basket.
