SCENE:
Thank God for it! replied the girl, as she lifted the babys brown
hand to her lips and kissed it fondly. I know hes a disgrace, mother,
but it would kill me to part with him now. Hes all Ive got left of
Fred.

I dont know that, my girl. Ive dreamed some strange things about
that Fred (as you call him) lately. Thats why I want to lay the cards
for you. That marriage of his hasnt turned out well. I feel sure of
it, though weve heard nothing of him since the letter he sent me to
say it was coming off. Hes in trouble of some sort, as sure as he
lives. I can see so much by the influences round the child, and I
verily believe its death.

Not for him, mother, cried Rhoda, quickly.

If its not for him, its very near him; but, if you wont cut the
cards, I cant say more. Your fate and his are so mixed up, that I
cant read one without the other.

Very well, mother, I will cut them, replied Rhoda, as she laid her
boy in his cradle, and seated herself at the table. You make me uneasy
when you speak of Fred so, and I shall not rest till I know the worst.

Mrs Berry produced her favourite pack of cards, which had been laid for
all the inhabitants of Luton, and, having withdrawn some from the pack,
directed her daughter to cut and shuffle the remainder, and lay them on
the table in three portions, with their faces downwards. As she raised
and dealt them out, she went on rapidly with her reading.

There he is, you see, she commenced, pointing to the king of clubs,
as black as the little crow yonder. And I was right. Theres death
round him. If it hasnt come, its coming, and its for his wife, not
for himself. See how he counts to the marriage ring in the lap of
death. Theres no escaping it for him, one way or another. Shuffle
them again, my dear, and cut as before.

Rhoda did as she was desired, and her mother scrutinised the cards
attentively.

Theres trouble around him, as sure as he lives, and danger threatens
him very nearly.

Danger, mother? What danger? exclaimed the girl, in a voice of alarm.

Not illness or death, my dear, so you neednt look so frightened.
But he seems to me to be surrounded by a net of some sort--as if
there were people about him who are trying to take advantage of
him--to rob him, perhaps, or to entangle him in difficulties. He is
full of perplexities. I dont like the look of this fair man who is
mixed up with him. Hes an enemy of his, and has done him, or will do
him, a great mischief. Hes been a bad man to you, this Mr Frederick
Walcheren, but he ought to be warned against those who are about him,
and especially of this fair man, or he will get into more trouble
still.

Mother, said Rhoda, timidly, do you really think that Fred has
behaved so very badly to me? He never promised to marry me, you
know--he never mentioned such a thing. I dont say that _I_ didnt
think of it, and hope for it, perhaps, but it was very foolish of me to
do so. How could he have married me? He comes of a very high family,
I have heard, and, under any circumstances, I am not fit to be his
wife. Of course, I should have thought of that before, and weighed
the consequences of my weakness, but then, mother, you see I loved
him, and Fred loved me in his way, so we were equally to blame. Cannot
you think of this trouble as you would if two children had gone out
to play together, and the weaker of the two had fallen down and cut
himself, whilst the stronger came back safe and well? We were equally
thoughtless and equally wrong. Why should Fred be blamed more than I,
because I have brought the worse trouble on myself.

She looked up shyly to see how her mother had taken her argument,
when she saw, to her surprise, that Mrs Berry had sunk back in her
chair in a trance. She was not alarmed, for it was an usual thing for
her to pass under control; but it struck the girl with a sense of awe.
Presently her mother sat upright, and addressed her in her ordinary
tone of voice.

If you love this man, she said gravely, you must try to save him.
In a few days it will be too late. He is about to imprison himself
for life--to deliver up his will, his mind, his very senses, into the
keeping of others, and he will be miserable under the discipline.
You will not be able to dissuade him from his purpose now, but your
visit to him will have a good effect. Dont worry him about your own
troubles. Only ask him to pause before he delivers himself over,
body and soul, a prisoner for life. His wife has passed over. He
thinks she died by an accident. It was not an accident. There was a
man mixed up with it--not very tall and rather stout, with light
hair, plainly parted in the middle, blue eyes, a straight nose, and a
pleasant smile. He is very particular about his hands and nails. He
has been your lovers worst friend--and _her_ worst friend, he--he--he
pushed--her--over!
