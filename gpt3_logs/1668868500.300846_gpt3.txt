What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Perhaps if your memory were assisted, said Madame dIonis with great
coolness, determined to encourage her mother-in-laws hobby; did they
say nothing to you about the future prosperity of this house?

It seems to me they did, in fact.

Ah! you see, Zphyrine, cried the dowager; you who believe in nothing
and I wager that they spoke of the law suit: come, Monsieur Nivires,
tell us all about it.

A glance from Madame dIonis warned me not to answer. I declared that
not a word of the law suit had I heard in my dreams. The dowager seemed
greatly disappointed, but consoled herself by saying: It will come! It
will come!

This, it will come, was very disagreeable to me, although it was said
with the utmost benevolence. I did not in the least care to pass another
bad night, but I readily resigned myself to my fate when Madame dIonis
said to me in an undertone, while the dowager was quarreling with
Zphyrine about her lack of faith.

It is very amiable of you to lend yourself to this fancy of the day in
our house. I trust indeed that you will have only pleasant dreams while
with us; and you are not absolutely compelled to see these three young
ladies every night. It is sufficient that you should have spoken of them
to-day to my excellent mother-in-law without laughing. It gives her
great pleasure and does not compromise your courage. All of our friends
have decided to see them in order to have some peace.

I was sufficiently compensated and magnetized by the air of confiding
intimacy that this charming woman assumed towards me to recover my
ordinary gayety, and I endeavored, during my meal to recall, little by
little, the wonderful things that had been revealed to me. Above all I
predicted through the green ladies, a long life to the dowager.

And my asthma, monsieur? said she, did they tell you that I would be
cured of my asthma?

Not exactly; but they spoke of long life, fortune and health.

Well, indeed; I ask nothing further of the good God.

Now, my child, said she to her daughter-in-law, you who tell a story
so well, relate to this good young man the cause of his dreams, and tell
him the history of the three young ladies of Ionis.

I assumed an air of surprise, Madame dIonis asked permission to give me
the manuscript, that she had only prepared, she said, in order to
dispense with going over the same story so often.

Breakfast being over, the dowager went to take her siesta.

It is too warm to go in the garden at noon, said Madame dIonis, and
still I do not wish you to work at that horrid law suit just after
leaving the table. So if you care to visit the interior of the castle,
which is quite interesting, I will act as your guide.

To accept your proposition is indiscreet and presumptuous, I answered,
and yet I am dying to do so.

Well, dont die, but come on, said she, with adorable gayety.

But she added immediately, and quite naturally:

Come with us, my good Zphyrine; you will open the doors for us.

An hour before, the addition of Zphyrine would have been very agreeable
to me, but I no longer felt so timid in Madame dIonis society, and I
confess that the presence of a third person annoyed me. I certainly had
no sort of presumption, no impertinent ideas; but it seemed to me that I
could have talked more sensibly and agreeably in a _tte--tte_. The
presence of this full moon blunted my ideas, and impeded the flight of
my imagination.

And then Zphyrine was thinking of the thing, that I, most naturally,
would gladly have forgotten.

You see now, Madame Caroline, said she to Madame dIonis, while
crossing the gallery on the ground floor, there is nothing at all in
the green ladies room; M. Nivires has slept there undisturbed.

Well, dear me! My good creature, I dont doubt it, answered the young
woman.

M. Nivires doesnt impress me as a fool but that doesnt hinder me
from believing that the abb Lamyre _did_ see something there.

Indeed, said I, with some emotion, I have occasionally had the honor
of seeing Monsieur de Lamyre, and I should have thought him no more of a
fool than myself.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Madame d'Ionis and Zphyrine, and to set up the conflict between them.
Madame d'Ionis is shown to be a kind and considerate woman, who is trying to make her mother-in-law's life more pleasant. She is also shown to be a bit manipulative, as she encourages the dowager's belief in the green ladies in order to keep her from worrying about the law suit.
Zphyrine, on the other hand, is shown to be a skeptical and practical woman. She is not fooled by Madame d'Ionis's ploy, and she is more interested in the reality of the law suit than in the dowager's fantasy.
