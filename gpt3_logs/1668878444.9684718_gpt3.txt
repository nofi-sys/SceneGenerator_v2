SCENE:
The sun was at its zenith when Roy once more opened his eyes. This
time there was no wonderment in them. He knew definitely and with
certainty what had happened. And if he needed proof that it was not
all a dream--and indeed, somehow it did create in his mind a
sensation akin to a nightmare--there was the bird lying at his side.
Yes, it had actually occurred--he, practically weaponless, had
fought an eagle and won.

He sat up, moving his arms gingerly. Everything appeared to be in
working order. He examined the cuts, and saw that they had been but
superficial and had already stopped bleeding.

Then he grinned.

Bids are open for the moving picture rights, he chuckled. First I
get in a scrap with a bear and then an eagle! But the boy, here,
nothing daunted, immediately enters the cave of the lion. Isnt
there a lion somewhere around?

Slowly he got to his feet. Then he noticed the wet sock tied about
his ankle. Except for this, he would have forgotten that the limb
had ever been hurt.

The pain must have been scared out of me, he said aloud, and
laughed again. His laughter was not hysterical. It was the wholesome
amusement of a boy who had a sense of humor, and the reaction from
his late suspense.

Then his mind leaped to thoughts of Teddy and the others.

Theyll be worried stiff, he declared. Theyll think Im drowned,
sure. Id better find some way of getting back to them. Never an
idea that his brother and Pop and Bug Eye might have failed to reach
the shore--might have been caught in the current, and killed. These
sombre thoughts had gone from him completely.

He retraced his steps to the waters edge. The river was once more a
placidly flowing stream, its surface harmless and innocent of
treachery.

Youre a hypocrite, Roy said. You are a two-faced fraud. However,
Ill try you once more.

It came to him that if he was to reach the mainland he must swim for
it. He breathed deeply, filling his lungs with the keen air.

My powers of recuperation are extraordinary, to say the least, he
laughed. Good thing I found that porcupine! All right--camera
ready? The boy hero will attempt to swim the terrible rapids--only
theyre more like a lake now. But well call em rapids to make it
look harder.

He removed his outer clothing and waded in. The opposite shore
seemed much nearer now, probably because the water had receded. At
all events, he struck out with a will and arrived on the bank not at
all exhausted. As he left the water he thought of the spectacle he
must present, with the wounds on his shoulder and arm still showing
plainly and dressed in a soggy suit of underwear. He burst into a
loud laugh.

Come, take a snapshot! he exclaimed. Having a wonderful time!
Wish you were here! The bathing is great!

Roy!

He turned his face alight with expectation.

Roy! Oh, golly, its Roy!

From the bushes leaped three figures--three happy, excited, capering
figures.

Teddy! And Pop and Bug Eye! The reception committee! The lost
mariners! Well, you old marmadukes!

Tears stood in Teddys eyes as he clasped his brothers hand. Frank,
honest tears, and Teddy was not ashamed of them.

Roy-- he said brokenly, we thought you were--

We thought you was lost! Bug Eye finished, with a side glance at
Pop. Snakes, we been lookin all over creation for yuh!

Son, Pop said simply, holding out his hand, Im glad to see yuh.
Mighty glad. We been worried.

Youre hurt, Roy! Teddy exclaimed, as he noticed for the first
time the cuts on the boys arm and shoulder. How did you get
those?
