SCENE:
XVII

PURSUIT


Slowly the import of what Bug Eye had said was realized by every one
in the Manleys living room. Teddy ran forward. Roy was not a moment
behind him.

Sit down here, Bug Eye! the younger boy cried, thrusting a chair
toward the swaying man. With a gasp of relief, Bug Eye sank into it.

Im sure some tired, he declared slowly, _and_ thirsty! If I
could have--

Just a second! Roy hurried to the pitcher of water which stood on
a table in a corner. Here! Take it easy now. Theres ice in it.

Bug Eye drank in great gulps, grunting with satisfaction. When he
had finished he leaned back in his chair and looked at the ring of
anxious faces. Even the orchestra had deserted its post and stood
with the others, eagerly waiting for the story of the robbery.

Are you hurt at all, Bug Eye? Mr. Manley asked. Anything we can
get you?

No, Im O. K. now, thanks, the man answered. I was just thirsty
and winded. Why, those double-distilled, knock-kneed, ornery bunch
of tin mule-stealers, drat their hides, made me walk all the way
from Sanborns Point!

Hes all right, Teddy said to Roy, with a grin. The same old Bug
Eye! Listen to him rave!

Having gotten some of the accumulated feeling out of his system, the
puncher ended with a vigorous whoosh! and started his story.

Well, when the boss got your message, he said, nodding toward Nell
and Ethel, he told me to get set for a trip to the X Bar X. So I
filled the ole puddle-jumper up with oil, gas, an water. Long about
four oclock the boss gives me two boxes an tells me to treat em
careful. Roy, hand me that pitcher again, will you? The young
fellow complied, and after another drink Bug Eye went on:

So I throws em in the back. I means I puts em in the back. Then
Mrs. Ball comes out an gives me another box, a small one, which she
tells me to be _very_ careful of. Says its a present for Miss Belle
here. And Bug Eye nodded once more. So I puts that with the
dresses--Mrs. Ball tells me what was in the other boxes, so I
wouldnt sit on em by mistake, he apologized.

Then I starts out. Got along fine till I reached Sanborns
Point--you know where that is, hey Teddy? Well, I shoots her the
gas, sos I can make the hill on high. But nothin doin. Bout half
way up she stalls, an I shoves her in low gear. Just as I do that,
I hear a yell, an three men with masks jumps from the bushes, guns
out, business ends toward me, an tells me to stop!

There was a buzz of excited comment, and questions were shot at Bug
Eye with machine-gun rapidity. He simply shook his head and went on.

Now, boys, give me time! Im tellin it as fast as I know how. As I
said, they tells me to stop. So I stops, not bein crazy. They pulls
me from the front seat an pushes me into the bushes. Then they hop
in, one of em behind the wheel, one of em keepin me covered. The
other watches out the side.

An up they go--up the hill an down the other side, with flivver,
dresses, present, an all!

But, Bug Eye, you said something about knowing who did it! Roy
exclaimed. Could you recognize the men?

Bug Eye looked up at his questioner. He leaned forward in his chair,
his elbows resting on his knees.

One of them, he said slowly and deliberately, had a scar on the
left side of his face!

Gilly-- Teddy burst out, and then stopped. His father cast a
warning glance at him.

Thought you said they had masks on? Mr. Manley remarked.

They did; but they was only half-masks, Bug Eye explained. I
could see the scar below.

Do you know any one with a scar on the left side of his face? the
cattle owner questioned, looking sharply at the seated man.
