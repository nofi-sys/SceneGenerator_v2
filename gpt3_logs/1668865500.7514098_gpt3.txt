SCENE:
There will be a great deal to do first, you know, Hannah, said her
husband. The Old Hall must be put up for sale, or to let. I wonder
what Arthur will say to that?

If you wish to reach the goal you have set before you, Henry, replied
Hannah; you must cease to think what people will say to your decision.
They have no right to say anything, and your anxiety may betray your
motive. You have proposed this plan very suddenly. You had better
consider it well before you decide. But oh! my dear, if I saw you
trying to purify yourself by leading a newer and better life, I should
be happier than I ever expected to be in this world.

We must see about it, we must see, said Hindes, as he staggered to
his feet; but what I am thinking of now is, what Arthur will say.

She found it useless to try and lead his mind back to the softening
mood which had for awhile possessed it, so she let him maunder on in
his old style, but took care to write the letter to her brother-in-law
before she retired to rest that night.

Captain Arthur Hindes was very much surprised, and just a little put
out, when he received it, which was just as he was on the point of
starting for home with his wife and family. It arrived too late to
enable him to make any alteration in his plans; but to spend a long
furlough in England on his own account, and to live with his brother,
paying a complimentary sum towards the housekeeping, were two different
things. The Henry Hindes had appeared so pleased to receive them, on
the former occasion of their visiting home, and The Old Hall was such
a big place, that want of room there could never be an excuse for not
taking them in.

I never was so vexed in my life, Edie, he observed to his wife, as
they read the letter together. I had so hoped and expected that the
former arrangement would have held good, and Hannah would have taken
all the trouble of housekeeping off your hands. Youre not in a fit
state to be worried about anything, just now. I feel almost inclined to
chuck it all up and go to the hills instead.

Oh, no, Arthur, dont do that, said his wife, who was ready to cry
over the disappointment. Perhaps Henry will feel better after a while,
and able to receive us. You see, you mustnt forget, dear, that we are
two more in number since we were in England last, and seven people are
really a formidable addition to any household.

Nonsense, my dear. The Old Hall contains about twenty bedrooms, and
Hannah says their own girls are away. And with their seven or eight
servants, what difference should we make, especially as you take your
nurses? Im afraid there is some other reason than the one given. I
cant fancy old Hal being nervous, or seedy. He has always been so
jolly and hearty and strong. There cant be anything wrong with the
business, surely?

Oh, no, not likely; but dont you remember, Artie, that when those
poor Cramptons died, Hannah told us that Henry was terribly upset.
Perhaps he has not recovered the shock yet.

No, my dear, Im afraid that sentimental explanation wont hold
water. Men dont mourn their partners demise quite so long as all
that, particularly when they remember their sons so handsomely in
their wills. Let me see. How long has old Crampton been dead, quite
nine months, if not more. Hal has had plenty of time to get over that,
however much it may have shocked him at the time. He must have worked
too hard at the business. Thats what shatters mens nerves more than
anything.

But what shall we do, Arthur, when we get home? inquired Mrs Hindes.

Thats easily enough settled, dear. I see Hannah offers to look out
for a furnished house near them; but it will be best to go a little
further off. If we are too near, there will always be a temptation to
run in and out, and that will be more distracting to Henrys nerves,
I should imagine, than if we lived there altogether. I shall take you
on arrival to a hotel in London, and when we have been there for a few
weeks, and seen a few sights, we will get a cottage in the country
somewhere, where I can have a little fishing, and you can keep your
cocks and hens, and have a pony carriage to drive about the lanes in.

Oh, Artie, dear, that will be delightful! I like the idea better that
the other. I never had you a moment to myself last time we were in
England.

And thereupon Mrs Arthur embraced her husband so heartily, that it
was evident that here, at least, was a happy couple, with no secrets
between them.

They reached their native land about the time they had intimated; and
the first thing they did, was naturally to go down to Hampstead and
see their relatives. It was about nine oclock one evening that they
were suddenly announced. Hannah was sitting alone in the drawing-room,
occupied with needlework, when the footman showed her brother and
sister-in-law into her presence. She rose in the utmost confusion,
letting her crewels and canvas fall to the ground without noticing it.
