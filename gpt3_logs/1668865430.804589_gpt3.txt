Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
But it was in vain! Strive as hard as Frederick would to fix his
thoughts on Saint Augustine, or Saint Chrysostom, or any other of the
holy fathers of the Church, their revered memories had to give way to a
pair of tearful blue eyes and a willowy figure bearing a little image
of himself in its arms.

He felt that he could settle to nothing until he had made peace with
his conscience by making such amends as lay in his power for the
grievous wrong he had done poor Rhoda Berry.

Hang it all! he said to himself, after a most unclerical fashion,
I must make some provision for that child, whether Rhoda likes it or
not. I cant make up my mind to give thousands to a Church, who is as
rich as old Crsus, whilst I leave my own flesh and blood unprovided
for. But she never even told me the little beggars name, and, if I
write to her for it, she will refuse again to take the money. Well! I
can settle it on her instead. I must see Mr Sinclair on the subject at
once!

This resolution, on his part, resulted in his sending a request to his
solicitor to call on him as soon as convenient, when he received him in
his private room.

I have asked to see you, Mr Sinclair, he commenced, in order to
place a confidence in you. You are aware, I believe, that, in a very
short time, I am to be admitted to Holy Orders, and that, when that
happens, my money, of which you have hitherto had the charge, will be
confiscated to the Church.

I have heard so, Mr Walcheren, and, frankly, I was very sorry to hear
it.

Ah, well, never mind that. It is all settled, so the less said soonest
mended. But, before the deeds are drawn up in favour of the Church, I
wish to make the disposition of a small portion of my property to an
old friend. I conclude I am at perfect liberty to do so?

Most certainly, Mr Walcheren; you can give, or will, the whole of it
away, if you like. The money was left absolutely to you for your own
use. Pray, dont be persuaded into thinking that you are in any way,
morally or legally, bound to give it to the Church.

No, no, I am aware of that. I make it over of my own free will. Only,
I should like to make this little provision first. What does my income
really amount to, Mr Sinclair? I have been such a careless dog, that I
never made myself master of the amount.

You have the estate of Tetley, in Shropshire, you know, Mr Walcheren,
which brings in about five hundred a year, and forty thousand pounds
in consols, and from fifteen to twenty thousand in scrip. Its a tidy
little fortune, and might be greatly increased by judicious handling.
Im truly sorry to find you throwing it away.

Hush! hush! man, what would the reverend fathers think if they heard
you speak of increasing the revenues of the Church by such a term? And
it will be all one, you know, when I am ordained. What good will money
be to me then? I shouldnt be allowed to spend it if I had it.

True, but is it quite impossible that you may not yet change your
mind?

Quite so; but let us keep to the matter in hand. I need not tell you,
Mr Sinclair, who have known me through my green sallet days, that
I have been a bit wild at times, and, amongst other peccadilloes, I
deeply wronged a young friend of mine, named Rhoda Berry. In fact,
she--she--has a little child of mine, and it is this child I am
desirous of providing for, but the mother has refused to take any money
from me. Cannot it be settled on her without any consent on her part?

Most certainly! any amount you like, provided you are in possession of
the young womans full name.

Yes! Her only names are Rhoda Berry, and she lives with her mother at
Elm Cottage, Harrow Lane, Luton.

Very good, replied the solicitor, as he noted down the information,
And the amount to be settled?

Five thousand pounds, replied Frederick, promptly.

Thats a large sum, Mr Walcheren, for a case like this. It means a
couple of hundred a year, remember.

And which do you suppose wants it most; this poor girl, who is thrown
probably on her own resources for life, with a child to keep into
the bargain, and all through my beastly selfishness, or the Catholic
Church, who has thousands of benefactors, and is rich in every sort of
treasure?

Oh! I am not blaming you, replied Mr Sinclair, who, being a
Protestant, would rather have seen the money thrown into the gutter
than go to enrich the coffers of the Roman Church. I think you
are quite right, and doing most handsomely by the young lady--most
handsomely indeed!
