Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
But, say Nell! exclaimed Shimph, who had also caught sight of
Brennen, yousre with me, aint ye?

Certny! with a lofty air, I dont shake me friends that way.

Re-assured, Shimph walked down the entry; Miss Fogarty beckoned with
the roses, and Brennen, a little abashed, came to her.

I thought, said she, that you couldnt come to-night. Whats the
matter?--didnt ye want to take me?

Ah, say, Nell! Whats the use--

Who did ye come with? Was it Mary Haley?

I came alone Nell; pon me soul, I did!

Eddy Brennen, if I thought you was double-faced enough to--

Will ye cheese it! If the gang git next theyll give me the laugh. I
didnt bring no lady, Nell. Im dead broke and couldnt, see! Thats
the reason I give youse the song and dance about not comin. When I
take youse out, I want to do the right ting.

Nells face grew brighter at this explanation and she said:

I knowed you wasnt workin, didnt I; and I didnt expect yed blow
your money when ye hadnt much. You aint acquainted with me, I can
see that right here. I aint no leg-puller. Got a ticket?

No, answered the youth awkwardly; Im waitin for a slow. Casey told
me thered be some goin aroun after the push got in.

For Heavens sake! cried Miss Fogarty: Dont hang around the door
waitin for a captain; yell git a hard name! She looked down the
entry where Casey was riffling a packet of tickets his shirt front and
rhinestone studs gleaming under the slanting rays of light. After I go
in, continued she, ask Danny for one; Ill fix it with him as I pass.

But, say Nell! I dont like--

Oh bother! She started to rejoin her escort, but stopped suddenly.

Look here, she cautioned, dont you ask me for a single dance; for
if ye do yell get flagged! Rox Shimph sent me these flowers and put up
money for a hack, and hes me partner for all the dances.

Say, are youse goin to trow me down for that--

Dont call him names! Hes run the pair o looms next to mine for
three years now, and hes always acted like a perfect gentleman. You
come to see me steady, Mr. Brennen, but I wont play Rox for a lobster
even for you. And with this she once more started away fumbling in her
purse and saying over her shoulder: Dont forget to ask Danny for the
ticket.

Murphy had gone to the street door to speak to a friend while the above
scene was enacting; now he came hurrying back to the gate excitedly.

McGonagle, exclaimed he, here comes Nobby Foley and Tim Daily wit a
couple o skirts. Ill bet well have the chain gang here!

Gee, murmured Goose. If they cut loose this wont be a ball, itll
be a scrappin match. Say dyouse tink four cops is enough? Hadnt we
better git the loot to send two more?

Murphy looked at him, disdainfully.

We aint a lot o kids, are we? inquired he. I might be dead wrong
but I tink the push kin hold their own with any of em. Theres only
one ting to do; as soon as they git gay, go in an slam em; aint
that right?

Foley was short and square-jawed; Daily was big and brawny; and both
carried themselves with much aggressiveness, swaggering into the hall,
their convoys on their arms, with the air of men whose deeds were epic
in the ward.

Thats a swell one wit Foley, whispered a voice. Who is she,
Brennen?

An old party rammer, answered Brennen; an shes the star pivoter of
Whalens Academy. Her an Bat Mahoney won the prize waltz at the Emmet
Bands picnic, Decoration Day.

Her hairs bleached, remarked the other; an that rouge on her face
is the reddest ting that ever come down the pike.

The girl was taller than her escort; she was remarkably handsome,
dressed richly, and held herself in a way that made the women whisper
and the men stare. As they neared the gate, she laughing and showing
her beautiful teeth and flashing her splendid eyes here and there,
McGonagle leaned forward and whispered a few quick words in Murphys
ear.
