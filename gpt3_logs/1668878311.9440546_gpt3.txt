SCENE:
X

A Figure among the Trees


Their meal was rather a sketchy one, for the men all felt that time
was precious and that to delay longer than was absolutely necessary
lessened, by just that much, their chances of saving their cattle.
Nevertheless, they ate heartily, though hurriedly, and when once
more they were in the canoe, with Teddy and Pop paddling, Roy gave a
sigh of relief.

Feel like a new man, he murmured. Now the thing to do is to give
the new man some food, I suppose, but Ill postpone that for awhile.
Glad youre doing the paddling, Teddy. I hate to work right after a
meal.

You might leave off those last four words and be nearer the truth,
his brother grinned. Me, I like it! Helps the food to digest.
Increases the salivary activity, and, by exciting the interior of
the diaphragm, it adds to--

Chuck it, Roy interrupted calmly. Youre talking Chocktaw. Heres
that bend you spoke of, Bug Eye.

Before them the river curved gently, sweeping through a broad lane
of grasses and trees. The current was swifter here, and Pop, who was
in the rear, and hence occupied the position of steerer, trailed his
paddle in the water and found that the boat sped along as fast as
though he were paddling.

A taste of whats comin, he declared. The banks are a little
narrower below here, an thats what makes the current faster. But
that dont mean we wont have no more work, Teddy, as he saw that
the boy had followed his example and allowed the stream to carry the
boat. It broadens out pretty soon, an then we hit it up again.

Dont worry--I know that, Teddy returned. Roy and I have both
been down this far, but not for a long time. But this curve is
familiar. Golly, it sure is pretty around here!

Silently the boy gazed ahead, resting his paddle across the canoe.
The scene was truly magnificent. The sun, past its zenith now, threw
flecks of gold on the water as it shone through the trees. Fleecy
clouds drifted slowly overhead. The willows nodded sleepily, as a
soft breeze stirred them.

I could enjoy this if we werent in such a hurry, Teddy sighed.
Then he turned to Roy and grinned. This is soft for you, hey, Roy?
Kind of beats a sunset, doesnt it?

Kind of, Roy answered absently. His eyes were dreamy, and as Teddy
saw them he winked at Bug Eye.

This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the
hemlocks, he began to quote softly, then suddenly gave a yell.
Hey! Its morning! Wake up!

What? Roy stared at his brother stupidly. Then a sheepish grin
came over his face. All right, you Indian! Ill get you for that.
But I sure was day-dreaming. Guess it was that meal.

Uh-huh, Teddy grunted, expressing his contempt of such subterfuge.

As the boat shot downstream, Pop Burns cast an appraising eye
shoreward. The foliage was especially thick at this point, almost
concealing the hint of mountains which rose back of the pebbly beach
line. The puncher thought that if a man wanted to make a getaway
after a crime, he would surely take this route. Unless by some
chance the pursuers stumbled on the fugitive, there would be very
little chance of finding him.

If he hugged the river, he could travel for miles without bein
seen, Pop muttered to himself, and squinted again toward the bank.
But I suppose he wouldnt have sense enough to do that. More than
likely, if a rustler wanted to dig out for another country, hed
take an overland route and have to ride like all get-out to keep
ahead. An if he wanted to, he could mosey along this bank an take
his time. Then, when he got to where he wanted, he could cut for it.
Seems that when a man takes to stealin an such like he loses what
little brains he ever had.

Strangely enough, thoughts of this same nature were revolving in
Teddys mind as his paddle dipped into the water. But they were more
definite and were centered about a certain man. That man was The
Pup. When they had received word that they were to leave the ranch
and follow their father, the boy had been nervous for fear Marino
might return and, out of revenge, try to do some damage to the place
or its occupants. Yet Roy had said there was not much danger of
this--that The Pup was miles away by this time. Surely if Roy--he of
the careful, mature judgment--was satisfied that the home folks
were safe, then Teddy had no cause for worry. Nick knew about
Marino, and knew he was a character to be watched. Nick would see to
it that Marino had his fangs drawn if ever he ventured to show his
face at the X Bar X again.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The scene is of a group of men paddling down a river in a hurry, admiring the scenery as they go. Teddy, one of the men, daydreams about a man named The Pup, and wonders if he will try to get revenge on them for leaving him behind. Roy reassures him that there is no danger.
