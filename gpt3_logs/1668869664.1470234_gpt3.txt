SCENE:
I promised, but could not see the future clear of trouble, for Dunbar,
for Lance, and for Miss Madison.

Dunbar went back to New York, to assume charge of Lance's yacht, and
I spent the next few months in fruitless argument, denunciation, and
threat; but I could not move Lance, and I think I drove him to harder
drinking. Then there came the time when Ella Madison, the girl I loved
as my own child, asked me to accompany her on a trip to sea in Lance's
yacht.

"I must disappear for a time," she said, sadly, "and I want you with
me. I know I will die if you are not with me, for he is inflexible."

"I'll go, my girl," I said, grimly, "and stand by you. But, God help
the scoundrel if things come to the worst."

I thought of Dunbar as I said this, wondering what he would do, when he
learned that his goddess was the victim of his savior.

But we packed up--my wife, the poor, weakened, and helpless girl,
and myself. We went to New York, boarded the black, shiny schooner
at Twenty-sixth Street, and put to sea, Dunbar delighted at the trip
with the woman he adored, and Lance drunk and disagreeable. It was
an unpleasant experience in his life, rendered necessary by his very
slight adherence to the conventions.

The yacht was a fine schooner of about a hundred and twenty feet
length, carrying, besides her skipper, a mate and twenty men, with a
cook, steward, and cabin-boy. She was well found, in stores and the
liquid refreshments dear to the soul of Lance, and well able to keep
the sea until this unfortunate happening was over.

I have not said anything so far of my wife, and she has small part in
this story. Let it suffice that she was with me heart and soul in my
interest for and love for Ella Madison, and our only desire was to
help her as we could, I as a medical man, she as a woman full of human
sympathy. The event came at the beginning of a gale off Cape Hatteras,
when Lance was half drunk, and Dunbar excited and interested in the
work of snugging down. He was on deck, and I heard his roaring orders
to his men while I, with my wife, attended the poor girl below in her
stateroom.

I had seen in Dunbar's eyes the suspicion that he entertained, but
had not yet brought myself to the point of informing him. Yet it came
unexpectedly, when, clad in oilskins, he caught me at the companionway,
and said:

"What's the matter? Is anything wrong with Miss Madison?"

"Dunbar," I answered, "she will be delivered of a child in less than an
hour; and its father is George Lance, who saved your life. Be careful
what you do or what you say."

The man reeled as though I had struck him, then went forward, and I
heard his voice, directing his mate and men. I hoped that his strength
of soul would stand by him.

I went below, meeting Lance in the forward cabin. He was
half-intoxicated, and I had small interest in his conversation, but he
said something that I remembered.

"No need, Doctor, to preserve any evidence of this. I'll see to that
all right. Just leave it to me, and she can go on and live her life,
and I'll go on and live my life, just the same. It's all a matter of
common sense. Understand."

I did not understand--until later, when, having left Ella Madison
with a small, crying creature in her arms, I went to my berth utterly
exhausted, and was aroused by my wife, who said: "The baby is missing.
Where can it be?"

I turned out and peeped into Ella's stateroom. She was sleeping
peacefully, but there was no sign of the babe.

"I only left her a few minutes ago," said my wife, "and the little one
was beside her. It had stopped crying."

"Go to your room, dear," I said, "and leave this to me."

She obeyed me and I went on deck. The yacht was hove to, under a
close-reefed mainsail, a double-reefed foresail, and the jib, with the
bonnet off. Forward, the watch on deck walked back and forth in twos
and threes, clad in snug oilskins and unmindful of the bombardment
of spume and spindrift. The mate was amidships, looking aloft and to
windward, and aft near the wheel was Dunbar, staring moodily into the
storm. I waited until he stepped forward to speak to the mate, then
approached the man at the wheel.

"Has Mr. Lance been on deck?" I said, nonchalantly.
