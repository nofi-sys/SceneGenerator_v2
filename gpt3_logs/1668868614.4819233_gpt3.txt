SCENE:
Hast thou seen any one from her house here to-day?

No, sir, no one. But whoever carried out the directions, nevertheless,
knows the ways of the house.

As I saw that I would gain nothing by the examination of material
things, I bade Baptiste good-night and gave myself up to my accustomed
reveries. This affair could no longer be explained naturally. This ring
contained the secret of my destiny. I was grieved to disobey my immortal
nymph, and at the same time I was happy in thinking that she was keeping
her promise of watching over me.

I did not close my eyes that night. My poor head was sick as well as my
heart. Ought I to disobey the arbitress of my destiny? Ought I to
sacrifice my honor to her? I was too much involved with M. dAillane to
retract my words. At times I entertained the thought of suicide so that
I might escape from the torment of an existence which I no longer
understood, and then I comforted myself with the idea that this terrible
and delightful deviceThy life belongs to me alonedid not have the
same meaning that I had at first supposed, and I resolved to pay no
attention to it, persuading myself that the maiden would appear to me at
the place of meeting, if she wished to prevent it.

But why did she not now appear to me in person if she wished to put an
end to my perplexities? I called upon her with the ardor of despair.

The trial is too long and too cruel, said I, it will cost me my life
and my reason. If I must live for thee, if I belong to thee.

A loud rapping at the street door made me tremble. It was not yet
daylight. I was the only one in the house awake. I dressed myself
hurriedly. A second knock was heard, then came a third, just as I rushed
into the vestibule.

I opened the door all in a tremble. I know not what connection there was
in my mind between this nocturnal visit and the cause of my anguish; but
whoever the visitor might be, I had a presentiment that all would now be
satisfactorily arranged. And such proved to be the case, although I
could not then understand the connection with subsequent events that
were soon to extricate me from my position.

The visitor was one of Madame dIonis servants who came post haste with
a letter for my father or for myself, as it was addressed to both.

While they were getting up in the house to answer the summons, I read
the following: Stop the law suit. I have this moment received and now
transmit to you a serious piece of news which releases you from your
engagements with M. dIonis. He is no more. You will receive the
official tidings during the day.

I carried the letter to my father.

_ la bonne heure_! said he. This is a fortunate piece of business
for our beautiful client, if this disagreeable dead man does not leave
her too many debts; a fortunate thing, too, for the dAillanes. The
court will lose the opportunity of rendering a fine judgment, and thou
that of making a fine speech. Comelet us go to sleep again, since there
is nothing better to do.

He turned over towards the wall; then called me back as I was leaving
the room.

My dear child, said he, one thing worries my mind, and that is if you
are in love with Madame dIonis, and if she is left penniless

No, no, father, I cried, I am not in love with Madame dIonis.

But you have been? Come, speak the truth, and that is the cause of this
change for the better in thee. The ambitious tastes which thou hast
developed and the melancholy which worries thy mother so much.

Certainly, said my mother, who had been awakened by the knocking at
such an unaccustomed hour, and who came into the room in her nightcap
while we were talking, be sincere now, my dear son. You love this
beautiful lady and I even think you are beloved by her? Well then,
confess to your parents.

I am perfectly willing to confess, I replied, kissing my mother. I
was in love with Madame dIonis for two days; but I was cured on the
third day.

Upon your honor? said my father.

Upon my honor.

And the reason for this change?

Do not ask me, I cannot tell you.

I know the reason, said my father, laughing and yawning at the same
time, it is because little Madam dIonis and this handsome cousin who
doesnt know her. But this is no time for gossip upon such subjects. It
is only five oclock, and since my son will neither make love or make
speeches to-day, I intend to sleep all the morning.
