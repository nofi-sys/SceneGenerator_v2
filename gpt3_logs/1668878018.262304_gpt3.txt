THE STORM


Going to start now, Dad? Teddy asked.

Yes--right away! Cant afford to lose any more time. The bunch from
8 X 8 is due any minute now, an were goin to start from here.
Well work in shifts--one gang take the trail tonight, and another
in the mornin. In that way well ride the rustlers down before they
have a chance to cache the cattle. We want to prevent those thieves
from driving the Durhams to a hiding place. If we keep on the jump,
we may be able to get em before they make their way to a retreat.

Mr. Manley hurried toward the corral. The two boys dismounted and
led their horses to the hitching rail, thinking they might need them
soon.

A hundred head of Durhams! Roy mused. Those fellows sure work
fast! Mighty funny they didnt start something with the X Bar X
herd.

Guess they thought that the 8 X 8 outfit would be easier to raid.
It looks like it was, too. What kind of men has Pete Ball got riding
his cattle to let rustlers raid their herd twice in a month?

Well, as I said before, that gang is pretty clever. Theyre no
amateurs at the game, and Ill bet theyve got half the men in
Eagles in league with them, especially those who hang around
Rimors. Say, do you suppose dad wants us to come with him?

Wait here while I ask him.

Teddy walked rapidly toward his father. It was in his mind to tell
his parent of the occurrence at Harvers Gully, but when he thought
it over he realized that it would be but a slender clue and might
lead the pursuers astray. Looking back, he could not be absolutely
sure that that man was Gilly Froud, however much he appeared to be.

No, son, I want you an Roy to stay around here, Mr. Manley
replied in answer to Teddys question. Mother is a bit worried, and
shell feel a lot safer if you two are here. You an Roy can go out
with the morning bunch--that is, if we dont spot the rustlers
before that. Belle Ada has to get to the 8 X 8 in the morning, too,
as she promised Nell and Ethel shed come over. Myself, Id rather
shed wait a few days, but she wants to go, so Ill let her. You and
Roy can take her over, cant you? You can join in the chase later.

Sure, Dad, if you say so. Well do whatever seems best to you.

Having communicated to Roy his fathers advice, Teddy put the two
ponies away for the night. He really wanted to ride with the rest,
but he knew it would be better for him to stay at home until his
father returned.

Six men from Peter Balls place arrived just before supper, and
after a hurried meal, the chase for the horse thieves started.

This time there was none of the wild rushing of the former pursuit.
The men clucked quietly to their horses, and, led by Mr. Manley,
they rode out of the yard. They were on a grim business, and each
felt the responsibility of his position. They were banded together
to wipe out a gang of rustlers. A stern task was ahead of them, and
they simply proceeded toward it.

With most of the punchers riding away with Mr. Manley, the ranch
yard of the X Bar X was now a quiet spot. For some minutes Roy and
Teddy stood in silence, watching the dust settle. The sky was
overcast, and the usual glory of the western sunset was missing. A
drizzle of rain was falling, and, turning about, Teddy and Roy
entered the ranch house, to eat in more leisurely manner than those
who had gone on the chase.

Supper was rather a dreary meal. Try as she would, Mrs. Manley could
not altogether conceal her anxiety for the safety of her husband.

Teddy reached across the table and laid his hand over his mothers.

Cheer up, Mom, he said, with a smile. Dads all right. Youll see
him come rushing in here in the morning, saying that they caught the
rustlers and is there any coffee and beans left.

Oh, I hope so, Mrs. Manley replied, smiling slightly. It is
foolish of me to worry, and I wont do it any more. Certainly your
father can take care of himself. Belle, dear, do be careful of that
pitcher! Roy, pour your sister some milk. I know shell spill it,
reaching in that fashion.

There were those at the X Bar X who did not sleep much that night.
Mr. Manley might return at any time and tell of success--or failure.
Many times Teddy and Roy leaped up from their beds, where they were
lying fully dressed, and ran to the window, only to find that the
noise they had heard was the wind blowing a shingle across the yard
or a horse in the corral rubbing against the rails. The drizzle
stopped, though the sky remained cloudy and a cold wind blew.
