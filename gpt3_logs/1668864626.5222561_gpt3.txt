Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Julie wished that Tim were there to share the delight with her. She
would have liked to stand and look across the flower stalls with him
beside her. It was hard to know what to buy, but at last she chose a
little bunch of blue nigella, love-in-a-mist, and made her way home.

Later in the morning she ventured upstairs again and, holding the
flowers, which she had put into a glass of water, in one hand, she
knocked upon Miss Foggs door with the other and waited as before,
standing in the empty uncarpeted hall with her heart fluttering.

There was no response to her knock; yet Julie could hear the sound of
some one stirring in the room. Again she knocked and again there was
no answer; yet Julie was sure that Miss Fogg was within. She waited a
moment more, and then turned the handle tentatively. To her surprise
the door was unlocked, and greatly daring, she pushed it open and
walked in. Her first impression was of the ill-smelling and wretchedly
untidy room; the next of old Miss Fogg standing by the side of her bed,
glaring at her with furious, sunken eyes. She had on a soiled and torn
nightgown, her gray hair fell wildly upon her neck, and her feet were
bare on the floor.

Oh--oh please excuse me, Julie faltered.

An who might you be? the old woman demanded in a cold fury.

Im--Im Julie--Julie Freeman, Julie said hastily, getting her words
out as fast as possible before the storm broke. Im living here in
the house. I brought you some flowers. I thought--

_You thought!_ the other screamed. You thought nothin! You wanted
to come pushin an pryin in here, sticking your nose where you got
no business, an nobody wants you, just sos you could run out in the
street an tell everybody how old Miss Fogg lives!

I didnt, I didnt! Julie cried. Of course I wouldnt do such a
thing.

But in truth she was so painfully aware of the whole dreadful state of
the room that she dropped her eyes perforce before the faded glare of
the others, and found herself staring down at the bare old feet.

Yes, the old woman cried shrilly. Look at my feet! Look at em good!
Look at em, I tell you! An then run out an tell the world how you
found old Miss Fogg in her dirty nightgown an her bare feet! Yes, look
at em! Look at em, I tell you!

The distracted old creature began a sudden fantastic dance of rage and
mortification, standing first upon one foot, and then on the other,
while the free leg kicked defiantly out at Julie, the nightgown falling
back from the withered shin. Yes, look at em, she screamed. Yes,
theyre dirty. Oh, my Lord! Go on, tell everybody what you seen!

Oh, my dear, my dear, Julie cried pitifully, you know I didnt come
for that! I--I just wanted to bring you these flowers. Im so sorry.
Her heart was jumping violently up and down; she wanted to turn and
flee; but she forced herself to stay. Shes crazy, she thought. She
must be crazy. Oh, poor thing, poor thing! It was awful of me to push
in like this, but now I am in, Ive got to stay an help her.

Look, I brought you some flowers, she repeated. I came to make
friends.

Friends! the old woman shrieked at her. _Friends!_ Oh, my God!
But her rage and her wild dance had exhausted her, and she sank down
now upon the edge of the tumbled, unmade bed, trembling and shaken.
Oh, she moaned, aint it a cruel thing that a person cant be left
alone--not one minute--sick an miserable like I am! But strangers got
to come pushin an crowdin their way in here to stare at my dirt
an my rags! Take your eyes off my feet! she broke out violently,
beginning once more to dance her feet up and down upon the floor, as
though shaking something off. Take em off, I tell you--I feel em--I
feel em lookin, burnin holes in my feet!

With shaking hands she dragged at her nightgown, endeavoring to pull it
down and cover her naked feet. But the material was old and rotten. It
gave way under the violence of her hands, and a long tear was wrenched
in it. For a moment old Miss Fogg stared at it, clutching the torn
stuff and peering stupidly at her bare old knees exposed by the rent.
Then she burst into impotent tears. Look, she wept. Now just look
what I done to my gown! All the rage and defiance were gone. She was
a despairing, helpless old woman weeping upon the edge of her bed,
incapable any more of coping with the difficulties of life.

Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! she wept, her shoulders shaking convulsively
beneath her straggling hair.

The tears leaped into Julies eyes. She came quickly and laid a tender
hand on her shoulder.

Never mind, never mind about your gown, she comforted. Ill mend it
for you.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Julie is out at the market, wishing that her boyfriend Tim was there to share in the delight of the experience with her. She eventually chooses a little bunch of blue nigella, love-in-a-mist flowers to take home.
Later, Julie musters up the courage to knock on Miss Fogg's door, holding the flowers she bought for her in one hand. After waiting for a moment with no response, she turns the handle and walks in, surprised to find that the door was unlocked.
Her first impression of the room is of its ill-smelling and untidy state. Miss Fogg is standing by the side of her bed, glaring at her with furious, sunken eyes. She is wearing a soiled and torn nightgown, her gray hair is wild and falls upon her neck, and her feet are bare.
The old woman immediately begins to berate Julie, screaming at her that she was just trying to come in and pry, sticking her nose where she has no business. She accuses Julie of wanting to run out and tell everyone how old and dirty Miss Fogg is.
Julie denies these accusations, trying to explain that she just wanted to bring her some flowers and make friends. This only makes Miss Fogg angrier, and she begins a strange dance, kicking her feet out at Julie and yelling at her to look at them.
The distressed old woman eventually sinks down on the edge of her bed, weeping. Julie comes over to try and comfort her, telling her that she will mend her nightgown for her. Miss Fogg continues to weep, shaking uncontrollably and muttering about how cruel it is that she can't even be left alone when she's sick and miserable.
