SCENE:
Neither boy spoke. Silently Roy leveled his rifle. The bear stood as
immobile as a statue, staring fiercely at the intruders, only his
head showing. Then, as the lips drew back in a snarl, showing the
sharp teeth and the red gums, Roy pressed the trigger.

There was a sharp crack. The bear started as though it had been
stung by a hornet, and a crimson spot of blood marked the black fur
just above the left eye.

Take it on the run! Teddy cried hoarsely, and fired as he spoke.
He knew the buckshot would have small effect, but he hoped it might
cause the animal to hesitate long enough to give them an opportunity
to make their escape.

As the bear moved forward Roy sprang to one side. With a yell to
Teddy to follow, he bounded to the right, then up, toward a ledge
that jutted out from the mountain over their heads. If they could
gain that, and the bear could not, they had a good chance for their
lives.

Teddy leaped after his brother. The bear, growling in rage at the
pain of his wound, sought to close his teeth in Teddys leg. The boy
gave a shout, and releasing his hold on the gun gave all his
attention to the business at hand--beating the bear to the ledge.
Strangely enough, as he scrambled up the incline, Teddys thoughts
reverted to the ranch yard, when only yesterday he and Roy had sat
on the corral fence and snickered as Pop Burns told about the time a
bear had tried to make a meal from Nick Lookers pants, while Nick
was in swimming at Lomleys Lake. According to Pop, the bear had
struck a fishhook in the back pocket, and out of revenge had chased
Nick all over creation.

Now I know just how Nick felt, Teddy panted. Never--as long as I
live--will I laugh at another bear story! Hey, Roy! Hang on to your
gun! Mines gone!

But even as he spoke, he heard a thud and saw their only remaining
firearm go sliding down the mountain. It hit in the path of the
oncoming beast, and the animal stopped for a moment to see what this
was that tumbled toward him. As the rifle reached him, he put out
his paw, stopped the gun, sniffed at it, then flicked it from him
with a snort, and once more lumbered on.

But at least the rifle had served one good purpose--for in that
small interval of time Roy had reached the ledge. He jumped upward,
careless of consequences, and felt his finger close over the root of
a tree. Straining every muscle, he gradually drew himself
up--higher--higher--and, with a gasp of thankfulness, he sank down
upon the rock.

Then, bracing himself, he stretched his arms over the edge toward
Teddy. The boy seized his brothers hands, and, grunting with
exertion, succeeded in gaining the shelf just as the bear reached
the spot where he had stood but a moment before.

Leaping lizards! Teddy panted. That was some close! Hey, listen
to that geezer grunt! Golly, I--

Ill tell a maverick it was close! Roy gasped. Another second and
youd have been mince-meat! I told you we shouldnt have followed
those tracks. If we had had a decent rifle--

_You_ told _me_! Well, for the love of Pete! And _you_ were the one
who wanted to do all this bear hunting! Great snakes! How do you get
that way? Wow! Listen to our friend! He wont be able to talk
to-morrow!

Below them the bear was uttering dire threats against their safety
and was trying desperately to reach the ledge by jumping. Every time
he sprang the boys heard the scra-a-a-ape of his claws over the
rock.

Teddy shook his head.

Baby, he remarked, I sure hope he gets discouraged easily! If he
ever manages to pull himself up here--good-night!

Cautiously Roy leaned over.

Hes still at it. Thank goodness this shelf is narrow. But the
point is, how are we going to get down? Its a cinch we cant climb
up that cliff. He motioned with his thumb to the wall back of them,
which rose straight up. As long as the old boy wants to hang
around, were his guests, he finished grimly.

Well, if you had frozen to that gun of yours we might have a
chance. But there it is, lying down on the rocks, not doing us a bit
of good. It might just as well be at home as down there. Say--

Teddy stopped short. Speechless, he seized his brothers arm and
pointed. Roy looked along the side of the mountain, then staggered
against the wall.
