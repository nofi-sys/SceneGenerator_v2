SCENE:
Walk in, Julie said, with dutiful hospitality, which was superfluous,
for, headed by Mrs. Wicket, the three were already trooping through to
the sitting-room.

Here, I cant see a thing. Wheres that hateful button? There, now!
Mrs. Wicket flooded the neat little room with light. Now, then, Julie,
we stopped by to see what was the matter with you, she announced.
She was a thin woman, with dark and snappy eyes, very precise in her
brown dress, to which there was not a superfluous ruffle, as there was
not an extra ounce of flesh on her spare body. Nom, thank you, I
always prefer a stiff-backed chair; you take the rocker yourself, she
interpolated to Miss Mary Humphries.

Miss Mary sat down in the patent plush rocker,--one that Julies father
had bought in the old days,--and her square figure firmly established
there and her hands clasped upon her Gospel Hymn book, she stared at
Julie. What made you slip away like that, Julie? she demanded.

Was you feelin bad, honey? old Mrs. Stover asked. She was a tired
old woman whose eighty years found it hard to keep up with her nieces
forty-five energetic ones, but she was afraid to be left alone and so
was forced to trail feebly in the others wake. She gasped now as she
sank upon the sofa, her mouth open and tremulous, although she tried
every now and again to shut it. But uncertain and dim as her eyes were,
they were the only ones that held any comfort for Julie. Was you
sick? she repeated.

But Mrs. Wicket, who never paid any attention to what her aunt said,
cut her short and demanded again, What made you slip out of church
like that, Julie?

I--I felt kind of funny, Julie parried, her cheeks turning red.

Mrs. Anderson said you stole out like that because you were afraid
Brother Seabrook would call on you to pray, Miss Humphries announced
heavily.

Mrs. Andersons right hot with you, Julie, for givin her the slip
like that, Mrs. Wicket stated.

Julie said nothing. She sat with tightly folded hands on her knees and
forced herself to look straight at first one inquisitor and then the
other, with what might appear to be an air of composure, although the
eyes seemed to bore into her soul, and to meet them squarely caused her
almost a physical discomfort.

Were you afraid he was going to call on you to pray, Julie? Mrs.
Wicket repeated all over again.

Well--well, he did,-- Julie blundered--and knew at once that she was
lost. That is--I--I was afraid he might, she added, frightened into
the truth.

Mrs. Wickets eyes snapped wide open. Why, Julie, she cried. Why,
how on earth did you know he called on you?

But Miss Mary Humphries had been caught by the second part of Julies
statement.

Why, Julie, are you really afraid to pray in public? she demanded.
Why! I think thats just awful. Her blue eyes stared at Julie out of
her wide heavy face.

But what I want to know is, how on earth you knew Brother Seabrook
called on you, Mrs. Wicket pursued. Mrs. Anderson said you left
before the sermon.

Miss Mary, however, was not to be thrown off her line of inquiry.
But, Julie! Not to be able to pray! she expostulated. Why, I cant
recollect when I couldnt pray in public.

But how did Julie know she was called on? Mrs. Wicket demanded. It
wasnt till after the sermon.

In my family, Miss Mary went on, heavily, my father raised us up to
pray an give in experience whenever called on, and--

How did you know, Julie?

And, Miss Mary drove straight on, not permitting Mrs. Wickets
excited interruption to throw her off the track, and none of us ever
did think anything of leading in prayer.

Well, now, thats just it, old Mrs. Stover suddenly came to the
surface long enough to remark. Maybe if youdve thought more of it,
it wouldntve come so easy to you. Some folks prays easy, an some
dont. Julie, you look real tired. If I was you, Id go right to bed,
an Ill be over in the mornin to see how you air.

Oh, thank you, Julie said, catching gratefully at the one remark that
she dared to answer. But Ill not be here in the morning. Im going to
Red River.
