SCENE:
Harry, on the contrary, grew more and more excited and light-hearted
as the train approached Beckham. His happiness at finding himself
again on the way to his beloved dogs and horses found vent in a burst
of affection. He bounced into the seat next to his wife at the last
stopping station but one, when, two passengers having got out, they
were left alone in the carriage. Then he treated her to a rough embrace.

Arent you glad to have left that smoky hole behind you and come into
the air again--eh, Annie?

But Annie was not, and a furtive tear told him so. He kissed her pretty
little face that the yachting trip had bronzed.

Dont cry, dear. Do you remember our last journey on this line, Annie,
when you were so frightened because I jumped in, and wanted me to get
out at the next station? And what a long time it was before I could
make you leave off crying! But you have nothing to cry about now, you
know, and I want you to look your best when we get to the station, that
everybody may say what a pretty little wife Ive brought home.

But there was nothing in this speech soothing to Annie, who looked
anything but her best when they did steam into Beckham station. Sir
George was on the platform to meet them, with a dog-cart waiting
outside, and Harry felt disgusted and angry with his wife, when
logically he should have felt glad, as he saw by his brothers first
glance at her that he thought her appearance much changed for the
worse. George drove, and Annie sat beside him, while Harry got up
behind with the groom. She was not very entertaining to-day, though she
tried hard to be so; but there was something pathetic to George in her
attempts to be lively, and the very tones of her soft voice had a charm
in themselves to him, so that he was touched, and listened to her with
a quiet kindliness in his manner which made much greater impression
upon her than the compliments and tender tones he had used to her
before her marriage.

I hope you dont so very much mind having to come and live at the
Grange. We will all try to make you happy, he took the opportunity of
saying when Harrys voice, in hot argument with the groom, rose loudly
enough to drown the _tte--tte_ in front.

She looked up at him gratefully, with the too ready tears in her eyes.

Thank you; I am sure you will, she said, gently.

Words better left unsaid to the heartsore and neglected little wife
rose to his lips; but her straightforwardness and a lull in the
conversation at the back checked them--for the present.

She treasured up those few words of kindness and welcome, all the more
carefully that the greetings she received from the rest of the family
were cruelly cold. Lady Braithwaite and her daughter held out icy hands
to her; Stephen had evidently taken sides with them; Wilfred was kind,
but rather indifferent; and William, the youngest, was restrained by a
very needless fear of exciting Harrys jealousy from showing the warmth
he really felt toward the sad-looking little lady who had made such a
delightful play-fellow.

The fatigue she felt after such a long journey excused her from talking
much. She sat very quiet during dinner, feeling scarcely awake, and
hardly catching the sense of the talk going on around her. Lilian
did not know very much about the odds for the great races which were
under discussion; but she liked to think she did, and joined in the
conversation confidently. Lady Braithwaite listened with interest
to the sort of squabbling laying down of the law on their favorite
subjects to which her sons had accustomed her for years.

Harry was rampant, rejoicing to find himself once more able to hold
his own in the talk around him; he drank more than usual, contradicted
everybody, and, as George quietly said, did his best to make his
unobtrusive presence felt.

Annie alone took no part in it all, but sat dreading the time when she
should have to accompany the other ladies into the drawing-room and be
at their mercy.

At last the moment came. She followed them quietly, receiving a parting
chill at the dining-room door from the steady way in which crippled
Stephen, who liked to show his activity by jumping up to open the door
for them, though he was not the nearest to it, looked on the ground,
and not at her, as she passed.

It was not so bad as she had expected, after all. Lilian had no
pettiness, and did not descend to small persecutions. She did not show
much cordiality, but hunted out all the newest songs from among the
music for Annie to try, and then left her to amuse herself. Annie was
grateful for this; it took her out of the range of Lady Braithwaites
disapproving eyes, and the occupation of trying new music kept her own
tears from falling. She could defend herself or even attack boldly in
argument or dispute, but this armed coldness took all the spirit out of
her; she could retreat behind her natural reserve and seem not to care,
but there followed a bitter reaction when she was alone.
