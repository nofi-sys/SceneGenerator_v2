SCENE:
VI.

The Committee of Safety.


The Committee of Safety was in session. This important body was
composed of the Selectmen of Eastham. In cases of extreme emergency the
town fathers were empowered to call the leading citizens into council,
and on this occasion there was a full attendance of representative
men ready to hear the report of the messengers who had been sent to
Provincetown for tidings of the captives.

Chairman of Selectmen, Obed Knowles, presided, and with him on the
bench were his colleagues, Samuel Freeman and Harding Knowles,
Esquires. Captain Heman Smith, who represented the town in the General
Court of the Commonwealth, was courteously given a seat with these
notables, while the others had to be content with the forms on the
floor of the town house.

The opening formalities having been gone through, the chairman called
on the messengers to come forward and tell their story. Master Timothy
Cole acted as spokesman for his companions.

Mr. Chairman, said he, we have, indeed, bad news to tell. Hoppy and
Win are prisoners, sure enough, and it is known that Captain Raggett
is to hold them for a heavy ransom, failing which, they will be
transferred to another ship and sent to England. This, we understand,
means that they are destined for imprisonment in Dartmoor.

That certainly is bad news, Timothy, said the chairman. What is the
opinion in Provincetown about the new policy of Captain Raggett?

Well, Mr. Chairman, they say he is in very bad humor. A sloop arrived
from England about three weeks ago and it is thought she brought fresh
instructions to Raggett. Before she came, the British sailors were
frequently ashore and behaved very civilly, leaving quite a lot of
money in the town in the way of trade with the people. The town is in
a bad state and this trade was a great help. The people say they are
in a worse condition than the other Bay towns, for the British ships
cannot approach such places as Eastham, Brewster, or Orleans closely on
account of the shallow waters and the sandbars, whereas, the harbor of
Provincetown is always open water and a fine anchorage for all kinds of
craft. From what we observed they are sorely pressed.

Is there no communication with the British allowed now, Timothy?

Very little, Mr. Chairman, but Master Jonathan Cook, of the Committee
of Safety, told me what he had gathered about the capture of Win and
Hoppy and how they were held for ransom.

Did Master Cook know anything about the terms of ransom? inquired
Squire Knowles.

No, squire, he had heard no particulars. However, he told us that Win
and Hoppy were being treated with great civility by Captain Raggett.
They had been seen on deck in company with one of the officers and
apparently on very friendly terms with him.

Very likely Captain Raggett appreciated highly that part of the
whaleboats cargo which was consigned to Master Thomas Crosby. This
sally of Peter Walker caused even the town fathers to smile.

Well, Master Walker, said Timothy, there is certainly a great
scarcity of good refreshment in Provincetown. We treated Master Cook
and his fellow-members of the committee to a little of what we had with
us, and they told us that since the sailors had been deprived of shore
leave there was nothing like it in the town.

Then the worthy citizens will be glad to see you again, Timothy,
replied Peter.

After this the discussion became general. It was felt that in the
absence of definite information from the Spencer about Captain
Raggetts terms there was no use in formulating plans to aid the
captives. A false move might have the effect of further complicating
the situation. It was evident that no help could be obtained from the
distressed people of Provincetown. That unfortunate town had been the
greatest sufferer from the depredations of the British during the
Revolutionary struggle, when the majority of the inhabitants, finding
the conditions intolerable, fled from the place and sought refuge
further inland. At the conclusion of hostilities they returned to
their ruined homes and valiantly set to work to regain their former
prosperity. In this they succeeded. The straggling town near the
tip-end of the Cape was once more a hive of industry, notable for its
hardy and venturesome seamen, when the proclamation of the embargo by
President Jefferson again set back the hands of the clock. From that
time until the peace of 1815, it was the old story of ruined trade
and constant suffering, their very lives dependent on the caprice of
the haughty foe whose splendidly equipped warships lay within a few
hundred yards of the town, and whose guns were ever ready to reduce the
settlement to ruins on the slightest pretext. Still, the people hated
to leave and they bravely bore their misfortunes, hoping and praying
for the day when the God of battles should once again decide the
contest in favor of their beloved country.
