SCENE:
Skelton lighted his cigar and began to smoke savagely. Was ever
anything like the perversity of fate--for he recognised as true every
word that Bulstrode had uttered. Because he had much money he had
started out to make Blair feel the weight of his resentment, and he
had spent fifteen or sixteen years at the business, and the result was
that Blair was to-day better off than he had ever been since he came to
mans estate, as he was free at last from a vice that had been eating
him up body and soul and substance for years. Skelton longed to heap
benefits on Lewis Pryor, but he very much doubted if any of those
things which he designed as benefits would make the boy either happier
or better.

Bulstrodes tongue continued to wag industriously. It seemed as if by
some psychic influence he followed the very train of thought then going
through Skeltons mind.

The women all like Lewis. I tell you, thats a very dangerous gift for
a man--worse, even, than genius.

Skelton quite agreed with this sentiment. If the late Mrs. Skelton had
not been so distractedly fond of him, for example, and had simply done
for him what any reasonably affectionate wife would have done for her
husband, he would not now be in the hateful position in which he found
himself. Her relations would be welcome to her money, but she had put
it quite out of the question that it should ever be theirs.

Women are monstrous queer creatures, anyhow, resumed Bulstrode
despondingly, as if his whole past and future hinged upon the queerness
of women.

Skelton could not forbear smiling a little. Bulstrode had suffered
about as little from the sex as any man that ever lived.

Woman, as we know her, is a comparatively modern invention, answered
Skelton, still smiling. She didnt exist until a few hundred years
ago.

Thats it, answered Bulstrode eagerly. Its the only fault I find
with my old chums, the classics; they didnt have any right notions
at all about women; they didnt know anything between a goddess and
a slave. But these modern fellows, with Will Shakespeare at the head
of the crew, know it all, blamed if they dont! There is that little
Juliet, for example--all love and lies, and the sweetest little
creetur in the world! Now, what did any of those old Greek fellows
know about such a woman? And its a common enough type. For my part,
Im mortally afraid of the whole sex--afraid of the good because they
are so good, and afraid of the bad because they are so deuced bad. And
as for their conversation, its a revelation, from that damned Mrs.
Shapleigh up.

Skelton could not keep from laughing at the mere mention of Mrs.
Shapleighs name, although he was in no laughing mood.

Shoot me, cried Bulstrode with energy, if that woman isnt a walking
_non sequitur_!

To this Skelton only answered: Every human being has a natural and
unalienable right to make a fool of himself or herself. But Mrs.
Shapleigh abuses the privilege.

Drat her, was Bulstrodes only comment.

How do you account for Miss Shapleighs wit and charming _esprit_?
asked Skelton, with some appearance of interest.

Because shes Mrs. Shapleighs daughter: everything goes according
to the rule of contrary in this world. I like to hear that grey-eyed
Sylvia talk; theres nothing like it in the books, it is so sparkling,
inconsequent, and delightful. And shes got something mightily like
an intellect. Mind, I dont admit that women have minds in the sense
of abstract intellect, but I say she has got such a vast fund of
perceptions mixed up with her emotions, that its twice as useful as
your mind, or mine either. Her education, too, is better than mine, for
its all experience, while I am nothing but a sack full of other folks
ideas.

After this Bulstrode stopped, and presently slouched off to bed. He was
surprised that Skelton had forgiven him so easily, or rather had been
so indifferent to his offense, but Skelton had a good many reasons for
not falling out with him then and there.

After that things went on very quietly for a time. Skelton did not even
mention the subject that he had talked to Lewis about the morning after
the ball, and Lewis went about, serious and sad, with a weight upon his
heart. The likeness between the two came out stronger every day. Just
as Lewis suddenly seemed to become a man and his face lost its boyish
character, so Skeltons face grew younger and gentler by reason of the
upspringing of a host of strange feelings. It seems as if the opening
of his heart to Lewis had made a new man of him. He sometimes thought
to himself: What wonderful vitality have these old emotions, after
all! It seems impossible either to starve them or strangle them.
