SCENE:
XXII.


Annie felt a curious and altogether new sensation as she submitted
to be carried off to the hotel by her husband, whom success in this
small enterprise had restored to the happiest and most affectionate of
humors. It was the first time since the early days of their marriage,
when the privilege had soon palled, that she had gone about with him
as a protector, and the pride and pleasure in the position which he
ingenuously showed, surprised and amused her.

They were, as he had predicted, very comfortable at the hotel. With
astonishing tact, Harry forebore to press his grievances against his
wife, and devoted himself to banishing the remembrance of the clever
man who could do everything by taking her to theaters and picture
galleries, and to the park, and to expensive dinners at the best
restaurants, with an assiduity which could not fail to touch her.
Indeed Annie did not quite know what a happy passage in her life this
was until after it was over. She wished to be, and she thought she
was, tormented a little by self-reproach caused by her bad treatment
of Aubrey Cooke; but the feeling was not strong enough to outweigh
the delightful sense of repose she began to feel in the consciousness
that she was surrounded by a great love. Her husband was so watchful,
so affectionate, refrained so consistently from exacting demands of
demonstrative fondness from her, that she had no time, no excuse for
such a sentiment as real regret. He insisted, against her will, upon
taking her to and from the theater to rehearsal, and asked her, when
she objected, whether she was ashamed of him.

If you are, say I am an old servant of the family, said he, proudly.

But Annie silenced him imperiously; and the confession she made in the
theater that she was married, and that the handsome young fellow who
brought her backward and forward was her husband, while it brought down
upon her some accusations of coquetry, sent her up in popular opinion
as the possessor of such a tall, well-bred-looking lord and master.

Life had gone on very smoothly in this way for nearly a week, and it
was the day before the opening night of Nathalie, when Harry, finding
himself at the end of his ready money, thought of changing his check.

In the evening Annie noticed that he was rather preoccupied during
dinner, and when she asked whether he had got some gloves he had
promised her, he said he had not been able to get them yet, but she
should have them on the morrow.

Did you change the check, Harry? You said you would give the money to
me to take care of, she suggested, laughing.

No, I havent changed it. The fact is, he continued, seeing a look of
perplexity on his wifes face. George has overdrawn his account a good
deal, and they wont cash such a big check until they have heard from
him.

But fifty pounds is not such a very large sum; and your family has
banked there for years and years, I know. Doesnt it seem rather
strange, Harry, that they should refuse when they know you so well?

This was a rather unfortunate suggestion, as the character of the
Braithwaite boys had not always stood high in money matters; but Harry
only said:

Oh, it will be all right, of course! I wrote to George this afternoon,
and I shall get an answer to-morrow or Monday. Dont you feel awfully
nervous about to-morrow night?

Indeed I do. If it were not for the way you take me about and divert
my thoughts, I believe I should make myself ill by the way I worry
myself about it. I must go now; rehearsal begins at seven, so I shall
be wanted at half-past.

This was the night rehearsal, on the eve of the production of the new
piece. For a week the manager had not slept, weighted with doubts about
the success of a performance which had cost him months of thought,
care and actual labor of body and mind. He was a popular man, and the
members of the company sympathized with him, though their own lesser
responsibility sat far more lightly upon them, and the green-room during
the last rehearsals, when doubts far outweighed hopes regarding the
piece they were all at work upon, rang with laughter as the foremost
wits of the company made cruel jokes upon the governor and his
troubles.

The next morning, just as Annie was starting for the last rehearsal of
all, a telegram came for her husband. He read it and thrust it into his
pocket without any remark and without any offer to show it to her. She
was getting used to quiet self-reliance on her husbands part: but this
action surprised her.

From George? she asked rather diffidently.
