SCENE:
The bitterness grew, became acute. Robert Dodson, still full of venom
and hatred, whispered in the ears of killers. The word was passed around
quietly that McClintock might be shot down any time. Friends came to
warn him. They carried the word to Hugh, who dropped his business at
once and joined Scot at Austin. From this time the younger man, in spite
of the Colonels good-humoured protest, travelled over the state with
his brother as a lookout.

At Carson the killers struck.

Scot had addressed an enthusiastic meeting, at which he had been heckled
by supporters of Dodson and had turned upon them with such witty scorn
that they had slipped out of the hall discomfited. With Hugh beside him
the speaker had returned to the Ormsby House. The younger brother was
putting up at the house of a friend. He left Scot in his room ready to
undress.

But when the colonel felt in his waistcoat pocket for a cigar he found
none. He stepped down to the barroom to get one. Baldy Green, the old
stage driver, was sitting by the office stove. The two fell into talk
and Scot sat down to smoke his cigar with the old-timer.

A man whom Scot did not know lounged into the office and out again. In
the darkness outside he whispered to two men. One of them was the
ex-mule-skinner Hopkins, a dyed-in-the-wool bad man; the other was Sam
Dutch.

The hotel office had three doors. One opened from the street, a rear one
led to the rooms, the third was a double swing door separating the
office from the bar. Scots chair was so placed that he faced the
entrance from the street and the bar. His back was half-turned to the
rear one.

The stage driver was talking. You betcha, Colonel. If us old-timers had
the say-so wed elect you by a mile. Sure would. That slick scalawag
Dodson, why hehe

Scots first warning came from Baldys consternation. His eyes popped
out. They were staring at some apparition in the back of the room. The
words of his sentence stuck in the roof of his mouth. Almost
simultaneously came the click McClintock knew from of old.

He whirled in the chair dragging at his revolver. It caught on his coat.
Two bolts of lightning flamed. The crash of heavy thunder filled the
room. Scot sagged in his seat, the curly head falling forward heavily on
the chest. From his slack fingers the revolver dropped.

Again the guns boomed. Another jagged knife thrust of pain went through
and through Scots body.

Got him. Got him good, Sam, an exultant voice announced hoarsely
through the smoke.

A hulking figure slouched forward cautiously. The victim lay huddled in
the chair motionless, both hands empty of weapons. No sign of life
showed in the lax body.

Always said Id git him. Dutch broke into a storm of oaths. He
reversed his revolver and struck the fallen head savagely with the butt.

Wed better make a getaway, the other man said hurriedly. This aint
no healthy place for us.

The gorilla-man struck again and broke the hammer of his revolver.

Out this way, he said, and pushed through the swinging doors to the
bar.

The heavy blows had beaten McClintock down so that he slid from the
chair. The doctor who attended him afterwards said that the effect of
them was temporarily to act as a counter-shock to the bullet wounds. His
senses cleared and his hand found the revolver. He was cocking it as the
second assassin vanished through the swing doors.

Scot concentrated his strength and energy, focussing every ounce of
power left in him to do the thing in his mind. With his left hand as a
support he raised the six-shooter and fired through the swing door.
Then, inch by inch, he crawled forward to the barroom entrance, shoved
the door open with his shoulder, and tried again to lift the forty-five.
It was not in his ebbing forces to raise the heavy weapon from the
floor.

But there was no need to use it again. The mule-skinner Hopkins lay face
down on the floor, arms flung wide. Scots shot through the swing door
had killed him instantly.

Baldy knelt beside his friend. Did they get you, old-timer? he asked,
his voice shaking.

Im still kicking. Send for Hugh, the wounded man gasped.
