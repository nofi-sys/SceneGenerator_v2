What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
I wanted to, butbut somehow he looked soso sort of _superior_

Yah! Thats Stars best bluff! Bet you anything if youd hit him just
one little tap on the nose hed have run! Hang it, Dud, youve got to
play up, boy! Here I am making you out a regular feller, and the first
chance you get toto put yourself in the lime-light you fall down!
Why, you had the finest sort of an opportunity to distinguish yourself!
Think what it would have meant to you, Dud! Fellows would have said:
What do you know about young Baker licking Star Meyer right in front
of Trow this morning? Had it all over him, they say! Beat him something
brutal! Some class to that kid, eh? Thats the way theyd have talked
you up. Now youve gone and

Dont be an ass, begged Dud with spirit. You know plaguey well I
couldnt lick Star. Hes six inches taller than I am, and hes at least
seventeen years old, and heshes stronger

Son, when you get in a row with another chap, replied Jimmy
emphatically, dont you stop to figure out how much bigger or stronger
he is. You jump in and get the first lick at him. Youll be surprised
to find what a lot of inches that first whack takes off the other chap!
What you should have done

Well, I didnt, said Dud shortly. You wouldnt have, either, I
guess.

Jimmy grinned. Never mind what Id have done, Dud. Im not making a
name for myself. Im not

Neither am I. You are. And Im getting sick of it. Its no use,
anyway. Lets drop it.

Drop nothing, replied Jimmy vigorously. Were getting on famously.
Why

Youve just said Ive queered myself!

I said youd missed a chance to make a hit. So you have. But we can
fix that all right. Those fellows who saw it will talk, I guess, but we
can talk too. Who were they?

I dont know. Stiles was one, though.

The sweetest little gossip in school, commented Jimmy. All right,
Dud, you leave it to me. Your Uncle James will fix it all hunky for
you. You sit tight andyes, thats the game! Dud, you must go around
looking very dignified for a couple of days.

Rot!

I mean it. You must make fellows think that you resisted a great
temptation and that it haserhas sobered you. Get me?

What temptation? asked Dud, puzzled.

Why, the temptation to lose your temper and beat Star up, of course,
explained Jimmy patiently. Thats our line, dont you see? It was only
byby superhuman control that you manfully resisted the impulse to
fell him to the ground! Great stuff, what? You just wait till I tell
it!

Jimmy, for the love of lemons dont start anything else! Every time
you get to talking you put me in a hole. Youve got fellows thinking
Im a wit, and they all look at me in a funny sort of a way as if they
were waiting for me to spring something bright, and I get tongue-tied
and cant think of a thing to say. And youre telling it around that
Im going to be a wonderful pitcher, too. They dont believe that, of
course, but it makes me look silly. And now you want to make me out
aa scrapper

Not at all, not at all! Star resented your remark about him and spoke
insultingly to you. You gave him a beautiful calling down and he didnt
dare talk back. Then, when your back was turned, he tried to kick you,
and you, stifling youreryour natural and excusable indignation,
kept your temper wonderfully and walked superbly away. All through the
encounter your dignity was sublime!

Dud groaned. Youll simply make me out an awful ass and fellows will
laugh at youand me. I wish you wouldnt, Jimmy!

That remark merely shows how little you appreciate my powers of
diplomacy, replied the other in tones of sorrowful resignation. But
never mind. I shall continue to do my best for you, Dud, even though
my efforts are unappreciated, misunderstood. Leave it all to me, my
young friend. Appear very dignified andand aloof. Lets see you look
aloof, Dud.

Dud only looked disgusted.

Not a bit like it, resumed the other cheerfully. More like this. Get
it? Sort of hinting at a secret sorrow orno, thats not exactly the
idea, either. You want to look like the hero in the second act of the
play, when everyone thinks he stole the jewels and the heroine spurns
him. He knows that hes innocent, you see, and knows that the audience
will know it in the last act. So he just looks disdainful and a bit sad
and sort of moons around by himself and smokes a good deal to salve his
sorrow


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Dud as a
dignified and aloof person who is misunderstood by others. The author
achieves this goal by having Jimmy tell Dud to act in this way after he
missed a chance to make a name for himself.
