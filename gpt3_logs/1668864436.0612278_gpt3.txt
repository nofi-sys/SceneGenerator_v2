What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
This announcement served as an unexpected reprieve.

Oh, you going to Red River? You goin there in the morning? Mrs.
Wicket and Miss Mary exclaimed together, deflected from their other
lines of thought.

Yes, to do some shopping, Julie nodded. And now she relaxed a little
inside herself, aware that the bait of Red River, which was the county
town and a shopping centre, would distract the others for at least a
little while.

Well, then, I certainly would be obliged if youd do a little errand
for me, Mrs. Wicket said.

An Ill get you to attend to a little business of mine, too, Miss
Mary added.

Ill be real glad to do it, Julie said, eagerly.

Mrs. Wicket and Miss Mary proceeded at once to give her minute
directions for the carrying out of their desires, and Julie listened,
assenting and suggesting with the nervous ingratiation of a little dog,
which, having escaped a whipping, hopes to reinstate itself once more
in society.

Having laid their shopping burdens on Julies shoulders, the visitors
rose at last to go.

Now, Julie, Miss Mary charged, dont you go and let that smart
clerk in at Randals persuade you into buying any of that cheap piece
of goods. It aint the shade I want, and if they aint got anything
better, Ill have to send off for it myself.

And remember to see Mr. Winter himself in at Winter and Whites, Mrs.
Wicket admonished her.

They were outside in the garden now, starting down the little pathway.
Julie called a good-bye, and shut her door hastily. A window was open,
however, and halfway down the path she heard Mrs. Wicket exclaim, Why,
there now! We never did find out how Julie knew Brother Seabrook called
on her.

Its awful, her being afraid to pray, Miss Mary rejoined. I ought to
go back an speak to her about it.

Here Julie snapped out the light.

There! she heard old Mrs. Stover announce. Shes goin to bed, like
I told her to!

Well, it certainly was mighty funny, but Ill find out all about it
to-morrow, Mrs. Wicket said, as their heels clicked away down the
cement walk; and Julie knew that her having sat upon the church steps
would yet have to be faced and explained.

Oh, I _am_ such an idiot! she broke out. And now the nervous tears
rushed forth, and she went about her preparations for bed, shaking
convulsively, wiping them away, and raging at herself. You idiot!
You idiot! she stormed. Even after the light was out and she was
stretched in bed, the devils of self-hatred continued to tear through
her. She tossed unhappily from one side to the other, going over and
over the whole miserable evening. Why had she run away? Why hadnt she
stayed and faced it out? Oh, but she couldnt pray--she just couldnt!
Well then, if she had to go, why hadnt she come straight home, instead
of lingering there on the steps? Of course that was a strange thing to
do. Of course people would think it funny if they knew. And they would
know. Mrs. Wicket would be sure to find it out, and sure to tell. Julie
writhed all through her thin body.

Oh, you little fool! she gasped. What business is it of Mrs.
Wickets what you do? Why cant you stand up to her and make her mind
her own affairs! Everybody comes an bosses you. Mrs. Anderson gave the
little bird to the cat, and Mrs. Wicket and Miss Mary poking into all
you do, an you takin everything from em just because youre scared
to look em in the face. Oh, you fool--you fool!--But I mustnt go on
saying fool! she wept.

Her shyness, her reserve, and morbid self-consciousness wrapped
themselves about her, as intangible as spider webs, but as difficult
to break as forged iron. As the night wore on, her having sat upon the
church steps assumed an enormity out of all proportion to the fact. She
knew that this was an obsession, but all alone in the depths of her
self-distrust and sleeplessness, she could not break free from it.

Oh, what a fool I am to take things so hard! she panted. Now
everybodyll know Im afraid to pray in public. There wont be one
person that goes to the Methodist church that wont know it. Oh, you
silly idiot! Oh, how I hate you! In a culminating burst of rage, she
turned over and set her teeth violently into her thin arm.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to show how Julie is feeling after her embarrassing experience at church. She is full of self-hatred and regret, and she is obsessing over the fact that everyone will now know she is afraid to pray in public.
