SCENE:
XXI

TRAGEDY


Indoors was the scene and sound of confusion. Delia, sensing the panic
that lay in the atmosphere, was crying wildly for her mother. The
other children, unchecked, were running about the house in a game that
seemed an improvised combination of tag and hide-and-go-seek. Their
excited cries rang from above. Arthur was at the telephone trying
to get Central. Beside him, a pencil ready to take down anything of
importance, very wan-faced and pale, drooped Dicky. From the dining
room came the clatter of plates as Harold and Laura went practically to
work to set the table.

Arthur stared at Maida and Rosie as they entered with their strange
bundle; stopped his telephoning to say, Where did you get that baby?

Ill tell you in a moment, Maida said wearily, but now weve got to
work fast and I never was so tired in my life. Oh Dicky dear, Im so
sorry for you! Poor, poor, Mrs. Dore and poor, poor Granny!

But it was Rosie who really took the situation in charge, Rosie who so
loved babies, Rosie who having helped so long in the care of her own
little brother, knew exactly what to do.

Tell Laura to get some milk from the ice chest, Arthur! she commanded
crisply, and warm it up on the stove as quickly as possible. Then
bring it upstairs to us. Maida, you come with me! Rosie marched up to
the bathroom and Maida meekly followed. On the first floor, Get Mrs.
Dores sewing board! Rosie ordered and Maida got it. In the bathroom,
Rosie placed the sewing board across the tub, close to the hand bowl;
began to undress the baby.

There were few things to take off. They were all loose, comparatively
clean, but ragged. Soon the little creature lay on the soft towels that
Rosie had spread on the sewing board, kicking feebly. The removal of
her clothes seemed to ease her. Her cry abated its violence a bit. Only
what was the translation of a baby sob came now and then. Rosie filled
the bowl with warm water, then with the gentlest of soothing strokes
and using the softest sponge she could find, she began to bathe the
baby. Its crying died down completely. It responded to this cooling
treatment with a little soft coo that drew from Maida, Oh the little
darling. Dont you love her already, Rosie?

I love all babies, Rosie said in a business-like tone, sopping the
little girls downy head. She dried her carefully--deft little pattings
that seemed merely pettings--with the finest towel she could get.

Run to Mrs. Dores room and get Delias powder! she commanded briefly
again. When Maida returned, she covered the little glowing form with
the cool powder. The babys eyelids began to droop.

See how sleepy it is, Rosie said with a kind of triumph. Ah there
comes Laura. Oh I wonder if she had the sense to put the milk in one of
Delias old bottles?

Laura had had the sense to do this, and was obviously proud of her
foresight. Very expertly, Rosie turned a few drops from the bottle onto
the back of her hand; decided it was not too hot; inserted the nipple
in the babys mouth. The little girl pulled on it like one famished;
pulled so hard and long and deep that Rosie had, once or twice, to take
the bottle away to keep her from choking. The little hands always
reached out for the bottle and after a few instants Rosie gave it to
her again.

In the meantime, Maida answered the stream of Lauras questions, and
Laura answered the torrent of Maidas.

The baby pulled continuously at the bottle. Rosie had to lift the lower
end higher and higher. After a long while, the baby dropped the nipple
with a little sigh of relaxation. Her eyes, which had been growing
heavier and heavier closed ... opened ... closed....

Now she was asleep.

I dont know what her feeding hours are, Rosie said. Ill give her
another feeding at four this afternoon. Im going to fix the alarm
clock so that Ill wake at ten to-night, then Ill let her go until
morning. I dont believe she has more than one night feeding. Even if
she does, she can get along without it, one night. She seems famished
now though. I never saw such a hungry baby.

You wake me up, Maida said almost jealously. Remember shes _my_
baby.

Yes, Rosie agreed, Ill wake you. She knit her satiny brows. I
wonder whose baby she is? They must be awfully worried about her by
this time.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is very matter-of-fact and business-like. There is a sense of urgency and panic in the air, but Rosie remains calm and takes charge. The dialogue is quick and to the point. There is a sense of cooperation among the characters as they work to care for the baby.
