SCENE:
Mr Cramptons face, which was always of a fine roseate hue, was now
positively purple, and, from fast walking and agitation, he found it
impossible to articulate. Hannah feared he was going to have a fit, and
urged her husband to get him to the house before he attempted to tell
them what was amiss. Even when he was placed in a library chair, it was
some minutes before he could find breath to speak, and, meanwhile, the
distress pictured on his features was unmistakable.

My dear friend, said Mr Hindes, with the greatest concern, are you
ill? Is anything wrong at home? For Gods sake, speak, and put us out
of this terrible suspense!

Shes gone, Hindes! shes gone! gasped Mr Crampton at last.

Gone? Who? Not Jenny? cried Mrs Hindes.

The old man nodded his head.

Not dead? said Hindes, turning as white as a sheet.

No! No! Gone off with that scoundrel Walcheren, replied Mr Crampton,
who had somewhat recovered himself. Didnt you tell me that he
promised to give up all pretensions to her hand, and to leave off
visiting her or writing to her?

He did, most emphatically! said Hindes. I was just telling my wife
about it.

And so did she--so did Jenny, continued the father, in a broken
voice; and they were both lying to us, sir--both lying! She has left
us for him. She writes she is married to him--that it is of no use our
attempting any opposition, and we may keep our worthless money for
ourselves--and our broken hearts too, I suppose, he added, in a lower
tone.

But it is impossible--there must be some mistake--how did it happen?
cried Henry Hindes, excitedly.

Well, they must have managed to have some communication with each
other since Wednesday, for the girl joined him yesterday. My wife is
such a fool--God forgive me for calling her by such a name!--that she
never exercised the least supervision over the child, and yesterday
morning it seems that Jenny said she was going to her dressmakers,
and they let her set off alone with Brunell. She told him on reaching
town--this is the mans story, remember--to put up the horses, and call
for her at the Burtons in Cromwell Road, at five oclock. He was there
to his time, and waited outside for an hour, when a caretaker came to
the door and asked him what he was waiting for. On his telling her, she
said that no young lady had been there that day--that the family was
still out of town, and she didnt know when they were likely to be home
again. On hearing that, Brunell drove to Madame Costellos, but learned
there that Jenny had left directly he drove off in the morning, and
had not returned since. A gentleman, her cousin, the woman said, had
fetched her away in a cab. The man came back with this story, and you
may imagine the night we have had. My wife was sure it was all right,
but I knew the end from the beginning.

Dont despair, sir, until you are quite sure, said Hannah, with ready
sympathy.

I _am_ sure, Mrs Hindes. We sat up all night, and the first post this
morning brought us that.

He threw down a scribbled note on the table as he spoke, and Hannah
picked it up, for her husband seemed too paralysed at the calamity that
had overtaken his friends, to be able to do anything. The note ran
thus:--

DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,--I could not give Frederick up, as you
desired me to do, because we love each other too much, so we were
married this morning at the Earls Court Registrar Office, where you
can see the entry if you doubt my word. Dont be too angry with me.
Remember I am your only child.--Yours affectionately,

JENNY WALCHEREN.

Thats a nice letter for a man to receive, who has idolised his
child for twenty years, isnt it, Mrs Hindes? asked Mr Crampton
sarcastically. Remember she is my only child; indeed, Im not likely
to forget it, I can tell Miss Jenny that. And Ill never see her again,
not if I live another fifty years!

Oh, dont say that. You dont know what may happen to alter your
mind, said Hannah, as she took the old mans hand in hers and pressed
it warmly. You love her dearly, and she loves you. Things will not
look so black when you are more used to them. After all, Mr Walcheren
comes of a good family, and--

And is a Papist, interrupted Mr Crampton angrily, a member of the
faith which I despise and abhor and contemn--the faith which will bring
my wretched daughter down to hell with himself. No, Mrs Hindes, my
dear; you mean kindly, but dont talk to me of ever seeing this matter
in a better light.
