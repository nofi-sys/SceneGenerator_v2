What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
With the boatswain standing my watch, I sat there until midnight; then,
as the other boatswain relieved him, I crawled into my berth, but not
to sleep. The problem would not permit it; for it was a problem that
would not solve. But, in my casting about for a solution, I was forced
to exonerate Bill, the only man besides myself with the "motive." For
how could Bill, whom I had seen on the yard just before going below,
descend to the lee alley, knife the mate through the window, and get
aloft in time to answer at four bells?

Mentally counting my steps along the alley and down to the passage,
the half-minute or so while I was engaged at the log slate, and the
succeeding interval of time between his death scream and Bill's call
from aloft, I found it incredible. Even had he been able so to time his
descent by any means as to reach the window before I had closed the
log slate, still the men had wakened at the scream, and one or more
would have seen him before he could have got out of sight behind the
cro'-jack on his way aloft. As for Tom, who also had a motive, though
a lesser one, he was out of the question. There were no beckets nor
lanyards with which to secure the wheel, and had he dropped it the
canvas would have been in ribbons before he could reach the window.
The steward, who slept off the forward cabin, had come out, rubbing
his eyes, palpably stupid from recent sleep; and he had no motive--the
mate had liked him. When I had sprung on deck the strong moonlight had
shown it clear of men as far forward as the main hatch, from which a
few were arousing themselves. The murderer could not have run forward.

Who else? I asked myself. Mabel? She could have run forward by the lee
alley after I had gone down by the other; but why? She had no motive
for the crime, and if she had why would she have chosen such a moment,
when discovery was inevitable? Then, too, it required strength beyond
hers to drive a sheath knife to the handle into the body of a man.
No, Mabel was also out of the question; but there came to my mind the
equally disquieting query, What was she doing on the main deck, or in
the alley near the mate's room, at that time of night? This I could not
answer; but at daylight it was answered for me.

Captain Merwin opened the door of my room, and I rolled out of my
berth. "Mr. Rogers," he said, "I owe you an apology. You did not kill
the mate. She has recovered and explained."

"Who did, sir?" I asked.

"One of the twin stowaways, she does not know which. I have ironed them
both in the 'tween deck; but they accuse each other."

"Brotherly love with a vengeance!" I commented. "But I cannot see how
either could have done it."

"My daughter saw one of them at the window. Here she is."

Mabel, her glorious hair disheveled, her face pale and drawn, her eyes
tear stained, pushed into the room, and incontinently fell into my
arms, her own around my neck.

"Oh, it's over!" she said brokenly. "It's over at last--and the strain,
and the worry! I could not have stood it much longer! I knew last night
that I couldn't; but you wouldn't let me speak!"

"Mabel, Mabel!" said her father. "Steady yourself, my girl!"

"Papa, go away!" she said. "I want to talk with Mr. Rogers, and you
could not understand--you haven't understood, at all."

He paused a moment; but she straightened herself before him and pointed
to the door. He left us together.

"And you did not understand, either," she said, turning to me. "You
thought I enjoyed his conversation, and his society, and his maddening
attentions. Why couldn't you see? It was only to quiet him, to flatter
his insufferable vanity, and keep him from further assault upon you. I
knew--I knew by your face that first day out that you would kill him if
he struck you again; and then--then the consequences! You had warned
him, threatened, and nothing would have saved you. They would have
hanged you--and what should I have done then?"

"And you did this for me, Mabel? Do you really care for me?"

"Since I first saw you," she said, her face flaming with color. "I
should not tell you now," she added, "only for what has happened; for I
heard your opinion of me that same evening."

"Then you also heard, Mabel," I said, as I took her again in my arms,
"that I have loved you, and waited for you, since you were a child."

"Yes," she answered simply. "Perhaps, after all, that is why I am
telling you now. I might have told you last night, and followed you
down to the main deck; but when I looked in you were busy, and I went
to the lee steps to go back and wait for you. Then I saw him at the
window, and--and I heard--and screamed. I must have fainted, and when I
wakened a little while ago Papa told me you had killed him--and I knew
better."


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:
