SCENE:
XVII


With a disgusted grunt, McNew, editor and proprietor of the New York
Gazette, flung himself back in his chair. He was impatient by nature,
and since he had bought the Gazette and made it the most notorious
if not the most famous paper in New York, he had stopped concealing
the fact. It is a bad thing for some men to succeed too soon in life.
If McNew could have put off his success for twenty years, it would
probably not have done him half the harm it did when he was thirty-five.

McNew had succeeded, so he had no patience with failure, not even
with the temporary failure that comes to all newspaper men at times.
His idea was that all information naturally belonged to the Gazette.
Sometimes it was wilfully kept from it by perverse persons, and anon
it was maliciously stolen from it by rivals; in either case he held
that the loss was due to the failure of the Gazette men. McNew never
admitted the impossibility of getting a piece of news.

In the present case he took no pains to hide his disgust.

So far as I can make out, Risdon, he jeered. Your trouble seems to
lie in the depraved desire of certain people to keep their business to
themselves instead of telling it to you. What I want to know is, why
do you let them do it? What in hells bells do you think the Gazette
brought you back from Germany and landed you in Washington for? What do
you think it pays you for? To report pink teas?

Risdon flushed, but not from embarrassment. Risdon had been a newspaper
writer too long to be readily embarrassed, even by his employer. But he
was very angry. He leaned forward and brought his fist down with a bang
on the table. See here, Mac, he began, furiously. If--

McNew drew in his horns a little. He wanted to stir up Risdon, but
he did not want to stir him too far. Aw! dont call me Mac, he
interrupted. Its too infernally formal. Call me Johnny.

A reluctant smile curved the corners of Risdons mouth. He and McNew
had known each other ever since they had been cub reporters on the
Alta California twenty years ago, and they understood each other
thoroughly. All right, Johnny, he answered, still a little huffily.
If you want my resignation, you can get it.

What would I do with it? retorted the other. I can get a better
scoop without turning around. I dont want resignations; I want
news. Im publishing a newspaper, and I want something to fill it.
Particularly, I want to know what the German and Japanese ambassadors
are discussing so often and so earnestly with the daughter of the
governor of the most Germanic state of all the states of Brazil. I
dont want pipe dreams; I want facts, f-a-c-t-s, facts, and not a lot
of rot like this; McNew crumpled a dozen typewritten pages in his
hand, and flung them contemptuously on the table. You call yourself a
newspaper man and cant find out a little thing like that? he finished
scornfully.

Little thing! Humph! It is all right to talk, and its easy enough to
invent plots a la Oppenheim, but--

Why dont you invent em, then, retorted the editor; instead of
sending in rehash like this. How many times have the Japs seized
the Philippines--in the newspapers? How many times has Germany made
faces at us since Admiral Diedrich tried to bluff Dewey at Manila
eight years ago? Pah! Its gotten to be a joke and a mighty bad joke,
too; and it isnt helped out much by the row over the schools in San
Francisco. Japan isnt going to war, and if she was going to war she
wouldnt give us warning that she was getting her back up. Shed jump
right in, and fuss about it later. A yarn like this is altogether too
fakey!

Risdon studied the other for a moment. You dont see any significance
in the Germany and Japan ambassadors meeting with a Brazilian countess,
then, dont you? he asked.

Mighty little. Wheres the connection? Whats Germany stand to win? As
for Brazil--Well! the founding of a German empire in Brazil--if thats
what youve got in mind--is about as mouldy as the Japanese attack on
the Philippines. This panatella countess is half a German, and its
entirely natural that she should run with the German crowd here. As
for the Japs--Well! that may be only a coincidence. Anyway! theres no
proof that would warrant me in risking half a dozen great big libel
suits. No! No! Risdon! If you want to run a yarn like this youve got
to have some real facts to back it up. Why dont you get them?

Risdon flung up his hands. How can I? he demanded. Ive done my
best. You know what these embassies are. No one can break into them
except a burglar--

Then turn burglar!

Not even a burglar, I should have said. No subordinate will talk; and
I can fancy what Bildstein or Siuki would say if I went to either of
them and asked to be told the subjects of their conferences with the
Countess Elsa.
