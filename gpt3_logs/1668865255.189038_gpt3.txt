SCENE:
In a few seconds the door opened again, to admit Frederick Walcheren,
leaning on the arm of his cousin, Philip. At first the jury wished the
latter to withdraw, but he refused to do so.

Is it not sufficient, he cried, for you to look at this unfortunate
man, to see what he is suffering, and that he is incapable of
confronting you alone? I refuse to leave him; if you insist upon it,
we will both withdraw. This is a court of inquiry, not of justice; how
dare you treat this gentleman as if he were a criminal?

I am not aware that the jury were doing so, Mr Walcheren, retorted
Mr Procter. However, as he seems ill, and you insist upon remaining
by his side, let it be so. It is not, however, the usual thing for a
witness to be examined in the presence of another person.

I dont care if it is the custom or not, replied Philip firmly. You
may commit me for contempt of court, if you like, but my cousin is too
ill to stand by himself, and I refuse to leave him.

Very well, sir, very well! replied the coroner tartly, if Mr
Frederick Walcheren answers the questions put to him, nothing more will
be said about it.

Frederick did indeed look more like a criminal than anything else. His
dark hair, which he wore rather long for the general fashion, was dull
and damp with the sweat which agony had forced from him. His features
were pinched and his eyes sunk, whilst his clear olive complexion had
assumed a yellow, waxen hue. The whole man seemed to have collapsed
under the force of his grief. He did not raise his eyes to the faces of
his inquisitors, but sat leaning back in his chair, with his gaze fixed
on the ground, and his hands clasped together between his knees.

Rouse yourself, if you please, sir, commenced the coroner, and let
us have as succinct an account as you can of all you know concerning
this distressing affair. Do you recognise the deceased, Jane Emily
Walcheren, as your late wife?

Yes! answered Frederick in a low voice.

Speak up, if you please! The jury cannot hear your replies. When did
you see the deceased lady last?

On Saturday morning.

Well, well, what more? cried Mr Procter, impatiently; tell us all
about it. Where did you see her, and when did you part with her, and
what did you do in the interim? We want the whole story, and cant go
dragging it from you piecemeal.

Say all you know, Frederick, whispered Philip, it will be so much
the sooner over and done with.

The unhappy young man made a visible effort, and said,--

I saw her last alive on Saturday morning at the Castle Warden Hotel
at about half-past eleven or twelve oclock. We had just finished
breakfast, and I left her to have a swim. I never saw her again until I
came--here.

How long were you away from the hotel?

I did not return till nearly three. That hour was fixed for our
luncheon.

Three hours is a long time to be taking a swim. What were you doing
for the rest of the time?

I was occupied in the water, all, or nearly, all the time, replied
Frederick.

But Mr Procter, who had never indulged in a bath but once in his life,
and that was the day before his wedding, when he caught such a cold
that he had never ventured into the water since, was not to be taken
in by so transparent an untruth.

In the water for three hours, sir! Do you expect the jury to believe
that?

I was in the sea for the best part of the time, swimming and doing
feats of skill. Some part of it must be allowed for dressing and
undressing myself. But the day was fine, and I did not care to come out
sooner than was necessary.

I believe I am right, Mr Walcheren, in saying that you were only
married to the deceased on the Friday previous?

That is the case.

Is it usual for a bridegroom to leave his bride alone for three hours
the day after their wedding in order that he may have a swim?
