SCENE:
Promise?

Yesto Inspector MacKeenon and Sir Richard.

Fay stepped back a foot or more. He stared at the slight form of Saidee
Isaacs as if he would crush her. His hands raised. His fingers clutched
deep within his palms.

I remember, he said evenly, that they were the ones who made the
promises. They said good by, good luck and God bless you, and sent me
on my way, scot-free, so I thought. TodaytonightI saw that hell-hound
from the yardMacKeenon! Then along you came. Does the world know that I
came here after that crib? Has it been shouted to the housetops? Im
done!

Saidee Isaacs blazed back with sudden fire. Her voice raised as she
said:

Youre only on parole! You cant escape them, Chester! Please do what
they want you to do. Do what I want you to do. Then everything will come
out right.

Fay turned his head away and stared toward the boat. The last passenger
was mounting the gangplank. The shore-lines were being cast off. A plume
of white steam issued from the pipe aft the squat funnel.

Im off! he said with final resolution. Ill take the old, old
trailaway from you and those hell-hounds. They cant catch me if they
try.

And me? asked Saidee, with none of her old fire.

And you can tell them I was with them till they rounded on me. They
know me! A crook has got to be trusted if you want him to play square.
Theyve shadowed me from London. Theyre still sniffing on my trail. But
water breaks it, and Saidee, its good-by!

Dont go, Chester. Youll be sorry.

Her voice had taken on an open threat. He caught the note and smiled
bitterly.

You werent that way once, he said, thrusting his hands in his pockets
and drawing his coat about his knees. Once, you were a pal. The best
pal a fellow ever had. Now youre hooked-up with MacKeenon and Co.
Youre working for the Yard. How did you get that housethat little
motorthose clothes? How did you get them?

The old fire flamed her eyes. She backed away and motioned for him to
go. Her hand dropped to her side. She waited.

Good-by! he said, turning. Tell your friends of the Yard its no use
looking for me. Ill be in

Dartmoor in three days! she exclaimed, walking toward the decrepit
motor car without glancing back.

Fay hesitated the fractional part of a second. He was of two minds.
Saidee had hurt him with her last thrust. It was like her to say that.
It was also a dare. He took it by swinging, striding for the gangplank
and dashing up its slope as two deck hands seized the handles to draw it
aboard.

The propeller throbbed. A hoarse blare awoke the birds on the bank of
the quay. A small group gathered and watched the ship ware out and take
the channel toward the sea. It clamped down the dark waters and rounded
a point upon which was a blue light.

Fay climbed up the forbidden ladder leading to the pilot-house. He
strained his eyes. The motor car with its twin cones of white fire was
still on the quay. In the tonneau of this he saw Saidee Isaacs standing.
Her hands were at her sides. Her veil was lifted up and over the brim of
her hat.

Suddenly, with a quick gesture, she drew down the veil. The car turned
clumsily and made for the dark aisles of the town.

Rolling mist blotted out both shores of the channel. The ship passed
painted buoys from which she sheered like a frightened sow in a pen. The
way ahead was found by reversing and keeping bare steerage-way. A
projector of yellowish light stabbed from the pilot-house. This was
turned on and off as each buoy was raised.

Windmills loomed above the low lines of the dykes. Fishing boats with
furled sails and quaint deck-houses astern swung at anchor. Once the fog
lifted sufficiently to reveal a long road running over a causeway which
stabbed like a white dagger through the night.

Fay descended the ladder and stood in the gloom of the forward starboard
boat which was drawn aboard and lashed to the davits. He allowed his
right hand to coil over the butt of the American automatic. Its cold
chill struck through his body. He was in no mood to be thwarted by
MacKeenon or the Yard. The bitterness of a vain project distilled black
thoughts in his brain.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Chester Fay is on the run from the law, and he's just about to board a ship to escape when he sees Inspector MacKeenon. Fay knows that if he's caught, he'll be sent back to prison, so he decides to take his chances on the open sea.
He climbs up to the pilot house, and as the ship starts to pull away, he sees Saidee Isaacs in a car on the quay. He's surprised to see her looking so prosperous, and he remembers that she was always a good friend to him. But then he remembers that she's working for the police now, and he decides that it's better to just forget about her and make his escape.
The ship sails into a fog, and Fay is forced to take shelter in the forward boat. As he's standing there in the darkness, he hears someone coming up the ladder, and he prepares to shoot. But it's just MacKeenon, come to try and talk Fay into giving himself up.
MacKeenon tells Fay that he's been following him for weeks, and that he knows Fay is innocent of the crime he was accused of. He also tells Fay that Saidee Isaacs is in love with him, and that she's been trying to help him.
Fay is torn, but in the end he decides to trust MacKeenon and go back with him. He knows it won't be easy, but he's hopeful that with Saidee's help, he can clear his name and finally be free.
