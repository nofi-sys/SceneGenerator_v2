SCENE:
Ill settle it to-night, he said to himself. Ill brace up and give
her a chance to flag me.

Half past eleven saw Larry hurrying toward Clancys. Two of OConnors
hacks were drawn up at the curb before the grocery, from one of which
McGonagle and Larkin were assisting Rosie, Annie and Maggie. Clancy and
OHara were alighting from the second, which they had shared with the
two bridegrooms; a flock of marvelling children were gathered upon the
sidewalk; and the heads of their elders were popping out of windows and
doorways full of wonder and surprise.

Larry raised his hat and took the hand which Maggie offered him.

Im sorry, said she, that I cant remain to see the result of your
planning. It is very clever! Larry caught the look in her eyes and it
said as plainly as words that it was no more than she had expected of
him. A sudden tumult was raised in his breast and perhaps he pressed
her hand a little; at any rate she flushed and withdrew it quickly.

I must get back to my class before the morning session is over,
she continued. The principal would only give me an hours leave of
absence.

Im comin to see you to-night, said he, courageously.

He did not even ask her permission! She gasped a little, in surprise,
but laughed as though she liked it.

I shall be at home, said she. Then she kissed the two girls.
Good-by, I shall run around this afternoon to see you both, and, with
a sly glance at OHara, to hear of the fun.

When she had gone, Larry followed the others into the house, Mrs.
Clancy embraced Annie and sobbed; then Annie and Rosie began to sob
also, while Goose and Jimmie looked uncomfortably at one another, each
with a feeling of guilt heavy upon him.

Here is yez raysate, Mister Clancy, said OHara, handing the grocer a
slip of paper. Its a man av me word I am.

Yousell get your cash, as soon as the fortune comes along, OHara,
McGonagle informed him reassuringly.

It was at this point that Kerrigan walked into the room.

Its a queer thing to do right after a wedding, said the young
attorney, after he had congratulated the happy couples, but the fact
is, Mr. Clancy, I am here to read a will. And as all the persons spoken
of in the document are present, I will, with your permission, get down
to business.

He took a neatly folded paper from his breast pocket.

The will, he continued, is that of the late Honora Cassidy,
spinster.

Ah! Ah! exclaimed Clancy, striking the table with his fist; Now
well know the rights av it. Faith an I knew Honora had money.

So its Honora Cassidy that yez meant? said OHara looking at
Larry. Then he turned to Kerrigan. Sure, I wur acquainted wid her in
Skibereen whin I wur a young felly.

I am aware of the fact, returned Kerrigan, dryly. The document reads
this way:

I, Honora Cassidy, being in sound physical and mental health, do make
this my last will and testament. Having remained a spinster up to this
date and recognizing the emptiness and loneliness of such a state, I,
in this instrument, do all in my power to prevent my half-brothers
child, Annie Clancy, from following my example.

With this end in view I bequeath all my estate, both real and
personal, with Charles Mason as Trustee, to the man who marries the
said Annie Clancy, on the condition that the ceremony is performed
within thirty (30) days after my decease.

Ha! An so yez knew av this, OHara! exclaimed Clancy. Yez knew av
it an played me the darty trick till git yez money out av McGonagle!

A stroke av business, Clancy, murmured OHara soothingly, A mere
stroke av business, sir.

But say, Kerrigan, put in Larry, with great innocence, if Annie
hadnt got married within the thirty days?--what then?

Then, replied the attorney, referring to the will, the estate would
have gone to the only man who ever made a proposal of marriage to the
deceased--and whom she refused.
