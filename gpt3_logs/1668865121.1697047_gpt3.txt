SCENE:
But she is under age, said Henry Hindes, speaking for the first
time. How could he marry her without the written consent of her
guardians?

By a lie, of course. He must have sworn she was of age. It came
natural to a Papist, no doubt. Theyre made of lies, religion and all!
Its a proper beginning for a life of deception and ingratitude.

But if the licence has been obtained under false pretences, Crampton,
said Mr Hindes eagerly, it may not yet be too late to set it aside.
It may be possible to force him to return your daughter to you, at all
events until she is of age. I dont know the law accurately on this
point, but I can go to town at once and inquire, and if there is a
chance--if she could be returned to you--

Mr Hindes urbanity seemed to have forsaken him at this juncture, for
he trembled so violently that his very teeth chattered.

And do you suppose that I would take her back? cried Mr Crampton,
vehemently. What! take the casket without the jewel! Receive my
daughter--no longer only my daughter, but that mans plaything--in
her dishonoured home? Never! I will see her dead first! I will stand
by thankfully, and watch her coffin lowered into the ground, sooner
than acknowledge her again as my child. I have no child now. My Jenny,
in whom I took such pride, for whom I have made money and treasured
and garnered it up, is gone from me. She is no longer mine. She is
Walcherens wife. I have lost her more effectually than if she had been
taken from me by death, as her brothers and sisters were, and never, so
help me God! will I see her of my own free will, in this world again.

He was fuming and raging in his despair, and Hannah Hindes motioned
to her husband, to do or say something to calm the old man. But Henry
Hindes remained as silent and motionless, as if he had been carved in
stone. Then she attempted the task herself.

Dear Mr Crampton, she whispered, laying her gentle hand on
his knotted one, surely you are going too far. This terrible
disappointment has come upon you too suddenly, but try to look at it in
a more reasonable light. Jenny has done very, very wrong; no one could
think otherwise, but you must not speak of her as if she were abandoned
to sin. She is honourably married, remember; and she is so young, that
perhaps she did not view the fault of rebelling against your authority
from so serious a point of view as we do. Mr Walcheren doubtless
persuaded her that it was only a venial error, which you would soon
forgive, for I cannot believe that she could ever forget your great
love for her, nor hers for you.

She smoothed the old mans palm with a motherly touch as she spoke, and
her soft voice and manner served in a measure to soothe his extreme
agitation.

You are a good woman, Mrs Hindes, my dear, he replied, more calmly,
but my daughter must abide by the step she has taken, however this
fellow cajoled her into it. She knew well enough that I would never
give my consent to her marriage with a d--d Papist. She gave me her
solemn promise, too, to give up all communication with him. She lied to
me, Mrs Hindes, as the man lied to your husband, and I renounce them
both--I renounce them both! Henceforth, I have no child. Heaven took
five from me, and the devils got the last.

And with that Mr Crampton drew forth a red silk handkerchief and buried
his face in it.

But what is to be done? inquired Henry Hindes, what is to be done?

Hannah glanced round at him in astonishment. His full, deep voice
seemed all of a sudden to have become thin and squeaky.

Mr Crampton seems to think that we can do nothing, dearest, she
answered.

But some sort of reply must be sent to her letter, he continued,
or she may present herself at any moment in Hampstead. She is very
impetuous, you know, Crampton, and will not easily believe that you can
be seriously angry with her. We must prevent a scandal if possible.
You had better write to her, or see her once, just to come to an
understanding, that you may know what to expect, and she also.

I will never see her, nor write to her again, said Mr Crampton.

Henry, could _you_ not do so? asked his wife, pleadingly. If Mr
Crampton consents to it, could you not first verify the marriage, and
then see poor Jenny, and tell her her fathers decision? Someone ought
surely to do it.

Where does she write from? asked Mr Hindes.

From the Castle Warden Hotel at Dover, whence they will probably cross
over to Paris. If you follow them it should be at once. Will you go?
Shall I get your portmanteau ready?


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The literary style of this scene is characterized by its formal, polite tone. The dialogue is stiff and formal, befitting the upper-class status of the characters. There is a sense of propriety and decorum throughout the scene, which is broken only by Mr Crampton's outburst near the end. The point of view is third person omniscient.
