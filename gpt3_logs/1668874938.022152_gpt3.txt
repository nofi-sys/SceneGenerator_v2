Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Is that her husband behind her--the tall man with the eye-glass?

Dont know, Im sure. Should think not.

The other laughed.

She is the handsomest woman we have had in front for a long time--much
better-looking than any of the professional beauties. Perhaps she is a
professional beauty--eh?

No--too good-looking.

It was the others turn to laugh; and, when they were called on to the
stage, they were still criticising the unknown fair one and anxious for
another view of her.

Annies curiosity was excited, and, contrary to her custom of devoting
her attention entirely to what was going on on the stage, she managed,
on her next appearance to say a few lines, to get an opportunity of
looking toward the box the two speakers had indicated. And she gave
one of the slightest, most imperceptible of starts, for the lady was
Lilian, exquisitely dressed and looking handsomer than ever. Annie
could not see the face of the man behind her in her glance at the box;
but she was anxious to know who it was, and later in the evening she
was satisfied; for a young actor named Gerald Gibson told another
in her hearing that the lady was Mrs. Falconer, that he had been to
a dance at her house two nights before, and that the tall man with
the eye-glass, who was one of the other occupants of the box, was a
Colonel Richardson, who had just returned from abroad.

All this filled Annie with excitement and anxiety. Had Lilian
recognized her? Who were the other people in the box? Had Colonel
Richardson really only just returned from abroad? These and other
questions concerning her sister-in-law and the rest of her husbands
family kept her awake that night in a fever of newly awakened interest
in the Braithwaites. The remembrance of her life at Garstone occupied
her very little now, the long, solitary hours of daylight, when she
was not engaged in rehearsal, she filled by writing, her old taste for
which had revived to console her for her otherwise monotonous life.
After the exchange of a few letters with William, she had heard no more
from him, and it was now more than two years since she had received his
last. During all this time no news had reached her, of her husband or
his family. She had said of late bitterly to herself that, if they had
cared to do so, they would have found her out long ago, and she had
begun to wonder whether she would ever see any of them again, when this
unexpected, yet most natural event, showed her again the one of all the
Braithwaites whom she least cared to see.

Annie liked Gerald Gibson, as everybody in the theater did--a grave,
quiet, thoughtful-looking man, whose reserved manners impressed those
around him with respect, even though it was often merely the result of
his having nothing in particular to say. He might have been the son of
a cheesemonger, but he was as perfect a gentleman not only in look and
manner, but in mind, as if he had been the son of a duke. Annie knew,
though she had known him only a few weeks, that she could speak without
reserve to him. On the evening after she had seen Lilian, therefore,
she found an opportunity, when they were on the stage together, but not
immediately concerned in the business of the scene, of alluding to the
beauty who had made such a sensation among them the night before.

I think I heard you say you were fortunate enough to know her, Mr.
Gibson, said she, her interest peeping out from under the indifferent
words.

I dont know her well. I was introduced to her about ten days ago, and
somebody got me a card for an At home at her house.

She is very beautiful, aint she?

Yes, very, for those who admire massive beauty.

Then dont you admire her?

Yes; but I have seen women I admire more.

I dont like such frosty enthusiasm. Is she nice, pleasant, amiable?

I dont think amiable is quite the word for that type of woman. But
she is very brilliant, very charming.

I used to know her once before she was married, said Annie in a low
voice. I am glad to hear she is happy.

I am scarcely able to judge of that. Ladies act so well, even when
they are not on the stage, and they are often charming when at heart
they are very miserable; so the novelists say.

You dont think she is miserable, do you? asked Annie, anxiously.

Indeed I have no reasons for thinking so. She seems to have everything
she can want, beauty, wealth, position, a good husband.
