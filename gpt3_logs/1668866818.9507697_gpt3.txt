Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
How long I fought that awful thing I cannot even guess. Time and time
again it charged me furiously and each time, though often by but a
miracle of fortune, I managed to keep it from closing, and each blow
that I delivered crushed and maimed it a little more, until at last it
was nothing but a bleeding wreck of pulp, still trying to crawl toward
me upon its broken legs and seize me and drag me down with its broken,
toothless jaws. Even then it was with the greatest difficulty that I
killed it, that I might put it out of its misery.

Rather exhausted, I turned to look for Nah-ee-lah, and much to my
surprise, I found her standing directly behind me.

I thought you had run away, I said.

No, she said, you did not run and so I did not, but I never thought
that you would be able to kill it.

You thought that it would kill me, then? I asked.

Certainly, she replied. Even now I cannot understand how you were
able to overcome a tor-ho with that pitiful little stick of wood.

But if you thought I was going to be killed, I insisted, why was it
that you did not seek safety in flight?

If you had been killed I should not have cared to live, she said
simply.

I did not exactly understand her attitude and scarcely knew what reply
to make.

It was very foolish of you, I said at last, rather blunderingly, and
if we are attacked again you must run and save yourself.

She looked at me for a moment with a peculiar expression upon her face
which I could not interpret and then turned and resumed her way in the
direction in which we had been traveling when our journey had been
interrupted by the tor-ho. She did not say anything, but I felt that I
had offended her and I was sorry. I did not want her falling in love
with me, though, and according to earthly standards, her statement that
she would rather die than live without me might naturally have been
interpreted as a confession of love. The more I thought of it, however,
as we moved along in silence, the more possible it seemed to me that her
standards might differ widely from mine and that I was only proving
myself to be an egotistical ass in assuming that Nah-ee-lah loved me. I
wished that I might explain matters to her, but it is one of those
things that is rather difficult to explain, and I realized that it might
be made much worse if I attempted to do so.

We had been such good friends and our fellowship had been so perfect
that the apparently strained silence which existed between us was most
depressing. Nah-ee-lah had always been a talkative little person and
always gay and cheerful, even under the most trying conditions.

I was rather tired out after my encounter with the tor-ho and should
have liked to stop for a rest, but I did not suggest it, neither did
Nah-ee-lah, and so we continued on our seemingly interminable way,
though, almost exhausted as I was, I dropped some little distance behind
my beautiful guide.

She was quite out of sight ahead of me upon the winding trail when
suddenly I heard her calling my name aloud. I answered her as,
simultaneously, I broke into a run, for I did not know but what she
might be in danger, though her voice did not sound at all like it. She
was only a short distance ahead and when I came in sight of her I saw
her standing at the edge of a mighty crater. She was facing me and she
was smiling.

Oh, Julian, she cried, I have found it. I am home and we are safe at
last.

I am glad, Nah-ee-lah, I said. I have been much worried on account of
the dangers to which you have been constantly subjected, as well as
because of a growing fear that you would never be able to find Laythe.

Oh, my! she exclaimed, I knew that I would find it. If I had to hunt
through every mountain range in Va-nah I would have found it.

You are quite sure that this is the crater where lies the entrance to
Laythe? I asked her.

There is no doubt of it, Julian, she replied, and she pointed downward
over the lip of the crater toward a narrow ledge which lay some twenty
feet below and upon which I saw what appeared to be the mouth of a cave
opening into the crater.

But, how are we going to reach it? I asked.

It may be difficult, she replied, but we will find a way.
