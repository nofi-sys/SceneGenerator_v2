SCENE:
From The Wall Street Journal:

D' B' ttn Ent' pses-Open 68 Close 43 off 25

Editorial From _The Journal of Temperance_:

"Elsewhere on these pages is an apology for not printing the
interview between our science reporter, Miss Agatha Westlake, and
Mr. Dusty Britton. The interview was not concluded because Miss
Westlake believed that she could detect the fumes of alcohol on Mr.
Britton. It is deplorable that the youth of this fair land have put
their faith and their future ideals into the character of a man of
such despicable hidden leanings. A package of cigarettes was visible
on the deck of Mr. Britton's boat and nearby was a small glass of
the kind only found in those dens of iniquity, the formal name of
which is forbidden to these pages.

"Let us therefore seek a new champion, who will eschew these vices;
who will find it more godlike to extend his gracious invitation of
vacation time to his youthful admirers instead of a woman of low
moral fiber. We feel--"

TIME _Magazine_, Science Section:

"Dr. Willy Ley, in an interview today in his retirement home in
Jackson Heights pointed out that he had always been convinced that
the limiting value of the speed of light was a false theory.
Therefore Dr. Ley concluded that it was entirely possible that an
extra-solar race could have developed interstellar travel.

"My grandson, Gregory, is aboard the Venus Rocket," said Dr. Ley in
the rich German accent that seventy five years in New York have not
diluted. "I hope to see the day he takes off for Alpha Centauri.

"But I do feel that there is reason to doubt the story offered by
Mr. Dusty Britton. Certainly the more intelligent persons of any
galactic civilization would be less likely to contact an actor than
scientists or government officials? This story of phanobands,
barytrine fields and menslators sounds too much like the fancies of
science fiction to me."

Article in _The American Weekly_:

"With heat rays and weapons of unimaginable power the enemies of
the Earth will swoop down to--"

From _The Chicago Tribune_:

"Not since the days of King George III has the threat of foreign
entanglements been so great--"

From _The Daily Worker_:

"Without a doubt this advanced culture has developed a perfect
galactic State, capable of serving all men according to their
needs. We feel that a pardonable mistake has been made by their
representatives in contacting a man of Dusty Britton's character,
and we will wait with open arms the return of the galactic
emissaries, who will bring with them the glories of--"

From Mount Palomar:

"Variable stars are of natural origin and can neither be started
nor stopped. The theory that such stars are used by a galactic
civilization as beacons and celestial stop-lights is utterly
fantastic."

From the teletypes of _Worldwide Press_:

"Dusty Britton was arraigned today in Federal Court for having
violated the rulings of the Federal Communications Commission and
the international rulings of the Havana Conference of 1972. An
indictment is expected from the grand jury, still in conference.

"Dusty Britton is charged with having caused the transmission of a
false distress signal. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment and
will probably plead not guilty if his case comes to trial. A fine
of ten thousand dollars or three years in jail (or both) is the
maximum penalty for a conviction. Public sentiment will probably
make the maximum sentence mandatory; this is an election year and
the Administration is interested in demonstrating that its foremost
desire is to serve the public interest."

Press Release from Cosmic Studios:

"The filming of first run of the new series, _Jack Vandal, Space
Rover_ was completed here after an extensive eighteen day program.
Jack Vandal is patterned after the characters of The Saint and The
Lone Ranger. Unrestricted by the laws that prevent a policeman from
performing his moral duty, hated by the underworld, Jack Vandal is
to become a Robin Hood of Space. The world premiere will take place
at The Palace Theatre, in Greater New York."
