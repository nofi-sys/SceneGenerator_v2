What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
A vague dread of evil in advance afforded apprehension of he knew not
what, that always, when the gloaming darkened most, seemed parted to a
tremulous, dim light, like summer coming through the morn, and made his
pulse go quicker, while those yearning memories faintly glimmered, as
if within a shaded reflex of the glowing day.

He kept himself strictly secluded; yet, day by day, those dainty
missives crept in upon him by some mysterious agency. At first they
were read mechanically, and, amidst his troubled doubts, produced no
apparent effect; but, by and by, they grew more chaste, more delicately
worded, and more sweetly toned.

Was it that they were really advanced upon the blundering specimens
we have seen? or could it be that his fancy had become excited with
regard to themthat he was merely idealising unconsciously? or was
it that those awkward first attempts at producing imitations of
the rhapsodical style peculiar to himself, which had so excited his
contempt, as obviously taken from the study of his writings, had now
been cunningly improved upon, since personal intercourse had afforded
his correspondent a closer insight of his purer and more simple forms
of expression?

Had his haughty egotism been touched at last, by a skilful reflex of
himself, thrown shrewdly into his eyes, from the dazzling surface of
this snowy crow-quilled page?

We shall see, perhaps. Here is the last that he received from her:

MY POOR FRIENDMy heart yearns over you; I am oppressed with your
suffering, for I feel how you suffer yethow you are struggling, by
day and by night, with those twin fiends of Doubt and Pride. I know
my letters soothe you, though they cannot heal. Had you not informed
me so, in your note, I should yet have been conscious of it. Had you
never written to me again, I should yet have known that the great deep
of your soul had been stirred at last, and that, though pride had
triumphed in the struggle, love, genial, human love, had yet found,
beneath the dark shadow of his wing, a warm resting-place once more
beside thy heart.

No human aid can save thee nowthat stiff neck must be bowedyou must
be humbled! Then will come the full influx of the light from heaven.
Then you will know joy and peace againthe pure raptures of a holy
rest will calm this dark, bewildering struggle. I pray for you without
ceasingweary the throne with supplication that you may be humbled!
Your little sister sends you her tearful greetingsshe weeps for you
with me alwaysfor she dearly loves her tiger-brother. She says that,
like all terrible creatures, he is _so_ beautifuloh, that he were
only good!
MARIE.

This letter strangely thrilled upon the already over-wrought
sensibilities of Manton, whose nervous organisation had been rendered
intensely susceptible by the protracted excitement under which he
had been laboring. He read it over and over again, with increasing
agitation, until it seemed, while his eyes suffused, as if the accusing
angel of his own conscience spoke to him in mild rebuke.

Long he moaned and tossedthe dim moisture struggling all the while to
brim over those parched lids, that for years before had never known a
freshening. Those tearless lidshow rigid they had been! how bleak!
Like some oasis fountain where the hot simoon had drank!Dry! dry!

Suddenly, with a deep groan, the young man bowed his head upon his
hands, while the tears gushed between his fingers in a flood, that
seemed the more violent from its long restraint. His body shook and
rocked, while he gasped aloud

It is true! It is true! This woman tells what is true! This sullen
pride has been the cause of allI feel its crushing judgment on my
shoulders now! Great God! deliver us from this thraldom! Let me but
know my race once more! let me but weep when others weep, and smile
when others smile, and it will be to me for a sign that thou hast
received the outcast into the family of thy love, once more! Forgive,
oh, forgive me, that have so long held thy goodly gifts of earthly
consolation in despite! The worms presumptuous arrogance has but moved
thy pity, oh, thou Infinite One! Forgive! forgive! oh, let me feel that
countenance reconciled once more! Give back to my weary soul the holy
communion of thy creatures! Pity! Pity! Pity! Ah, there is a paradise
somewhere on the earth, for the most wayworn of her darkened childrena
rift in the sunless sky, a glittering point above the darkened waters!
Men are not all and totally accursed by their defiant passions. Pity
sends star-beams through the port-holes of the dungeon. Mercy comes
down on holy light of visions, where stars cannot get in. Oh, love,
Infinite Love! Thou art so powerful of penetrationcome to me now!

For a long time he sat thus, while his frame shivered in voiceless
throes; when suddenly straightening himself, with a powerful effort,
and while the tears yet rained like an April shower, he drew towards
him his paper, and wrote
