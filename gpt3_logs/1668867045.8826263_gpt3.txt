What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
I was the closest to her and the moment that I saw her danger I started
forward; but even as I ran, there passed through my brain some terrible
thoughts. She is Kalkar! She is the spawn of the beast Pthav and of the
woman who turned traitor to her kind to win ease and comfort and safety!
Many a little life has been snuffed out because of her father and his
class! Would they save a sister or a daughter of mine!

I thought all these things as I ran; but I did not stop
runningsomething within impelled me to her aid. It must have been
simply that she was a little child and I the descendant of American
gentlemen. No, I kept right on in the face of the fact that my sense of
justice cried out that I let the child die.

I reached her just a moment before the bull did and when he saw me there
between him and the child he stopped, and with his head down he pawed
the earth, throwing clouds of dust about, and bellowedand then he came
for me; but I met him half way, determined to hold him off until the
child escaped, if it were humanly possible for me to do so. He was a
huge beast and quite evidently a vicious one, which possibly explained
the reason for bringing him to market, and altogether it seemed to me
that he would make short work of me; but I meant to die fighting.

I called to the little girl to run and then the bull and I came
together. I seized his horns as he attempted to toss me and I exerted
all the strength in my young body. I had thought that I had let the
hellhounds feel it all that other night; but now I knew that I had yet
more in reserve, for to my astonishment I held that great beast and
slowly, very slowly, I commenced to twist his head to the left.

He struggled and fought and bellowedI could feel the muscles of my
back and arms and legs hardening to the strain that was put upon them;
but almost from the first instant I knew that I was master. The Kash
Guards were coming now, on the run and I could hear Or-tis shouting to
them to shoot the bull; but before they reached me I gave the animal a
final mighty wrench so that he went down first upon one knee and then
over on his side and there I held him until a sergeant came and put a
bullet through his head.

When he was quite dead Or-tis and Pthav and the others approachedI saw
them coming as I was returning to my wethers, my skins and my cheese.
Or-tis called to me, and I turned and stood looking at him, as I had no
mind to have any business with any of them that I could avoid.

Come here, my man, he called.

I moved sullenly toward him a few paces and stopped again.

What do you want of me? I asked.

Who are you? He was eyeing me closely now. I never saw such strength
in any man. You should be in the Kash Guard. How would you like that?

I would not like it, I replied. It was about then, I guess, that he
recognized me, for his eyes hardened. No, he said, we do not want
such as you among loyal men. He turned upon his heel; but immediately
wheeled toward me again. See to it, young man, he snapped, that you
use that strength of yours wisely and in good causes.

I shall use it wisely, I replied, and in the best of causes.

I think Pthavs woman had intended to thank me for saving her child, and
perhaps Pthav had, too, for they had both come toward me; but when they
saw Or-tis evident hostility toward me, they turned away, for which I
was thankful. I saw Soor looking on with a sneer on his lips and
Hoffmeyer eyeing me with that cunning expression of his.

I gathered up my produce and proceeded to that part of the market place
where we habitually showed that which we had to sell, only to find that
a man named Vonbulen was there ahead of me. Now there is an unwritten
law that each family has its own place in the market. I was the third
generation of Julians who had brought produce to this spotformerly
horses mostly, for we were a family of horsemen; but more recently
goats, since the government had taken over the horse industry. Though
Father and I still broke horses occasionally for The Twentyfour, we did
not own or raise them any more.

Vonbulen had had a little pen in a far corner, where trade was not so
brisk as it usually was in our section, and I could not understand what
he was doing in ours, where he had three or four scrub pigs and a few
sacks of grain. Approaching, I asked him why he was there.

This is my pen now, he said. Tax collector Soor told me to use it.

You will get out of it, I replied. You know that it is ourseveryone
in the teivos knows that it is and has been for many years. My
grandfather built it and my family have kept it in repair. You will get
out!

I will not get out, he replied truculently. He was a very large man
and when he was angry he looked quite fierce, as he had large mustaches
which he brushed upward on either side of his noselike the tusks of
one of his boars.
