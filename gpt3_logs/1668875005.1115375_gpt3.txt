What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
But he looked as much pleased as his inexpressive face ever allowed him
to look. And when Mrs. Briggs came in just in time to get tea ready,
affecting great surprise at their being home before her, and protesting
that she had understood both of them to say they would dine out, they
were both still chatting amicably by the kitchen fire. Aubrey was in
such high spirits that he seized the occasion to thunder forth a long
harangue at the frightened and apologetic old woman.

Is this the way to treat two members of a profession which numbers
in its ranks the fairest of Englands women and the noblest of her
men? Woman, do you take us for amateurs? Your four hours of trifling
and foolish chattering in the market-place--a thing which Bunyan
condemns as most reprehensible--have been gained at the expense of an
afternoon of unspeakable suffering and wretchedness to two of the most
pecuniarily desirable inmates who have ever condescended to take up a
temporary residence under your inhospitable roof!

Mrs. Briggs was overwhelmed.

I am sure, sir, I am very sorry. But you looked pretty comfortable
sitting there by the fire together.

Comfortable! This woman says we looked comfortable, said Aubrey,
turning in amazement to Annie, who hastened to say:

And so we were, Mrs. Briggs--at least, I was. As for Mr. Cooke, some
people are never contented, you know.

And she ran away laughing to her sitting-room, while Aubrey went
up-stairs to his, singing Siebels song in Faust in a very loud but
very melancholy voice.

After that afternoon in Mrs. Briggs kitchen, Miss Langton and Mr.
Cooke were very good friends. Annie found in him just the same boyish
high spirits which had made William such a delightful companion, while
the fact of his being well-educated and witty gave him a charm in which
the Braithwaites were one and all sadly deficient. So that it gradually
came to be a matter of course that he should find out what was worth
seeing about each town which the company visited, and that he should
then take her to see it, and that, if they were in sentimental mood,
they should unite in conjuring up pictures of the olden time in the
ruined abbeys and crumbling walls they inspected; while, if they felt
inclined to scoff at antiquity, they laughed together. The half-tender
tone of deference which gradually grew up in his manner to her did not
cause Annie the least uneasiness. She looked upon him as a universal
lover, who could not keep sentiment quite out of his intercourse
with any woman, and, if any one had told her that Aubrey Cooke was
growing seriously in love with her, and that her friendly manner was
encouragement, she would have been very much amused at the suggestion.

But Aubrey had in truth grown quite conscious of the fact that this
capricious little woman, with her alternate fits of cold shyness and
madly high spirits, who could parry his nonsense with nonsense just as
wild one moment, and the next hold her own in a serious discussion, had
a charm for him which made all other women seem insipid in his eyes.
She was lovely to him; even when her little brown face looked colorless
and unattractive to others, it was full of pathetic interest to him;
when she was looking her best, when the wind had brought the bright hue
of health to her cheeks and her eyes were sparkling with fun or easily
roused excitement, he could not take his own vacuous light-blue eyes
off her face. If his face had been more expressive, she could not have
failed to discover that his interest in her was deeper than was safe
for his own peace of mind; but unluckily Aubreys features were the
most perfect mask ever worn by a man whose feelings were in reality as
keen as his intellect.

Time after time he had made up his mind that he would propose to her at
such a time, at such a place. For it had come to this, that he felt he
must make her promise to be his wife, if she would, before this tour
was over. But, whenever the moment came which he had looked upon as
propitious for the plunge, his heart failed him, or she would be in the
wrong mood, too friendly or too satirical, and the question had to be
put off. After all, there was no need to hurry matters; there were some
weeks of the tour to run yet, and in the meantime their intercourse was
delightful, and in the awful possibility of her saying No there would
be an end of even that.

And there was a burden on his mind which he was anxious to find an
opportunity of removing. It concerned Colonel Richardson and the
interest Miss Langton took in that handsome Lovelace. He made himself
an opportunity rather clumsily. They were reading an epitaph of the
usual order on some man who seemed to have had all the virtues, to have
been beloved and respected by everybody, and to have made a blank in
the universe by his death.

He was too perfect, said Aubrey. I suppose his widow put up this as
a salve to her conscience after worrying her husband to death.

Well, perhaps she really thought it.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Annie and Aubrey, and to hint at Aubrey's feelings for Annie.
The author achieves this by having Aubrey take Annie to see the sights of each town they visit, and by having them share intimate conversations. The author also hints at Aubrey's feelings for Annie by having him notice even the smallest details about her, and by having him feel nervous about proposing to her.
