Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
She asked me to tell her the circumstances which had brought me to
Lautenburg, She had heard some of the details from Marais, but from
the smile with which she told me this I had no difficulty in guessing
her opinion of that diplomatist's perspicacity.

It was plain that she wanted to know my story, and I met her wishes with
straightforward simplicity. Towards the end, as I felt her interested
and friendly, I could not help giving her a moving picture of the
distress our first meeting had caused me, I who had no sooner set eyes
on her than my sole idea in life had been to gain her regard.

Melusine von Graffenfried nodded approval, closing her eyes as she blew
rings from her cigarette to the ceiling.

"Please let us forget all that, Monsieur Vignerte," said the Grand
Duchess. "Give me your hand." Then, turning to Melusine, she spoke in
Russian, not knowing that I had a smattering of her native tongue.

"It's no good relying on him for my admission to the _Kirchhaus_."

Frulein von Graffenfried replied with a shake of the head, which might
be interpreted as "Didn't I say so?"

"Melusine," said the Grand Duchess, "light the samovar."

While the girl arranged the teacups round the heavy, humming tower of
burnished copper, Aurora rose from the bed and opened a small
secretaire. She beckoned me to her.

"Do you know that writing?" she asked, holding out a letter.

I examined the paper. I had never seen the writing in question.

"It is the hand of the late Grand Duke Rudolph," she said simply.

My surprise grew to amazement. She could not restrain a smile.

"But, excuse me, madame. I don't understand. Then whose is the document
I sent you, to which I owe ..."

"Don't get excited; keep calm, Monsieur Vignerte. The paper to which you
owe my regard--nay, my friendship--was not written by my husband, the
late Grand Duke. But it is not without its value for me. It may even
have a greater value."

As she spoke she unfolded the document "I see there a name," she said.
"Sangha. Do you know where it is?"

"Yes," I answered. "I found out this morning. It is a miserable village
in the Cameroons--the last German post, ten leagues from Fort Flatters,
the first French post."

"That's the place," she added, "and you don't seem to know that it was
in that very village that the Grand Duke Rudolph died of sunstroke on
the 10th of May, 1911. He is buried there. Now you will realize my
feelings on seeing in the list of projected stages of his journey the
name of the place where he was to stay for ever."

"But whose is this list, then? Who drew it up?"

"A friend," replied the Grand Duchess, "the Grand Duke's faithful
companion. The same man who saved his life twice in the Congo. The same
who stayed with him to the end, and rendered him the last services,
though he was unable to save him from the fell malady."

"What was his name?" I asked.

"Baron Ulrich von Boose."

"Boose!" I cried. "So it was Boose!"

The Grand Duchess turned rather pale and drew herself up to her full
height. Melusine, at her feet, had stopped playing the guitar, which was
lying on the floor.

"What do you mean, monsieur?" said Aurora of Lautenburg. "Please explain
yourself."

I had already recovered myself somewhat, and was vaguely conscious of my
stupidity. I wanted to turn the conversation, but the Grand Duchess was
not to be put off.

"Do you know Baron von Boose?"

"Excuse me, madame," I stammered. "I don't really know whether I ought,
whether I can ..."

"What oughtn't you to say? What can't you say?"

I cursed my clumsy and premature exclamation, which looked like
compromising in one second two months of patient approach. Thoroughly
alarmed, and grasping at a straw, my eyes fastened on Melusine.
