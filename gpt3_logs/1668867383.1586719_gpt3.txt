SCENE:
III A PERIL OF TROPICAL WATERS


Days and nights followed. All the time the boat continued to head into
the south, and leagues upon leagues were placed behind them. Sometimes
they were able to pick up glimpses of land far away to the west; and
one night the boys were told that the flashlight they watched, so like
a distant star, was Jupiter Light situated at the lower extremity of
the Indian River in Florida. Off somewhere in the opposite quarter lay
the Bahamas, and Old Nassau, of which they had read so often.

They were now getting down to a warm climate, and on this account
spent as much time on deck as possible. Here the ocean breeze fanned
their already ruddy cheeks, and they could watch the white-winged
gulls and other sea birds flying in eccentric fashion here, there, and
everywhere, now dipping to snap up a fragment of food cast overboard,
and anon wheeling high overhead, or following the course of the
speeding submarine as though keeping time with its progress.

Occasionally they met some vessel bound north. Now it might be a
lumber schooner, and then again a coastal steamer. When one of the
latter passed not far away the side seemed to be black with people,
all staring at the strange, squatty craft, for doubtless the officers
passed the word around that it was one of those species of undersea
boats that had been creating such terrible havoc across the Atlantic.

So the time slipped along, and one sunny day they drew near an island
in the Caribbean Sea where the palms hung low over the water, and made
a picture that set Jack busy with his camera, for it was really his
first chance to do anything along that favorite line.

Seems that were meaning to lay by here a short spell, Ballyhoo
announced, as the ardent photographer was busying himself with his
camera.

Whats the scheme? asked Oscar. Have we arrived at the first pocket
where they believe they can strike a rich bonanza?

Not yet, along those lines, he was informed by the wise Ballyhoo,
evidently seeking to let them know that he had been interviewing
Captain Shooks. Our port engine doesnt work as it should, you see,
and our careful skipper believes in taking time by the forelock, so
hes going to spend a few hours in overhauling it. You see, theyre
putting out an anchor in the lee of this island. If we only had time we
might get the collapsible boat out and go ashore.

It would hardly pay us, ventured Oscar. Well have plenty of other
chances to stretch our legs on a tropical cocoanut island, I imagine.

Then I wonder if it wouldnt be a bully good idea to have a swim?
continued the other, evidently bent on making some sort of dent in the
monotony of the programme.

Better ask the captain about that first, suggested Oscar.

But why should he care, when I can swim and dive like a duck?
objected Ballyhoo.

Just then the commander coming up from below the Jones boy put the
question to him, and in such a wheedling way that the grizzled old
skipper chuckled as he went on to say in reply:

Well, I can feel for you, Ballyhoo, because when I was young swimming
was my best hold. Id go any distance just to get in the water. Its a
fine day for a duck, too, with those clouds sailing over, and dimming
the hot sun part of the time. So I guess you can enjoy yourself for
half an hour or so. But stick close by, son, and if you hear a shout
make for the boat like greased lightning.

Ballyhoo looked curious on hearing him talk in that way.

Whos going to bother with me here, sir? he asked. I can see a
couple of natives in canoes headed out this way, but the Indians are
only bent on trade of some sort; most likely theyve got cocoanuts or
oranges or bananas to sell. What should I be afraid of here, Captain?

Oh! I dont really believe theres any danger, lad, but in these
Southern waters its always wise to keep an eye to windward for
squalls, and by that I mean sharks.

Gee whiz! I forgot that! exclaimed Ballyhoo; and then thinking that
he saw Jack laughing in his sleeve he hastened to add: but that
doesnt faze me one little bit. I guess I could get out of the way of
a lazy old shark any time.

Accordingly, Ballyhoo commenced to undress. He was a regular water duck
when it came to all such aquatic sports as boys delight in, and could
both swim and dive in a way that no other fellow in all Melancton ever
equalled.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Ballyhoo is on a submarine headed south. They pass an island in the Caribbean Sea and the captain decides to anchor the submarine and do some repairs. Ballyhoo asks the captain if he can go for a swim and the captain agrees. Ballyhoo is a strong swimmer and dives well. He swims around for a while and then hears a shout. He swims back to the submarine and is told that a shark was spotted.
