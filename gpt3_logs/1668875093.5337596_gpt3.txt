SCENE:
XVI.


Annie soon found herself in a difficult position between the
brother-in-law she liked and the husband she disliked. William was
always wanting her to be out of doors with him, Harry teased her
with sulky reproaches if she was away from him for more than half an
hour at a time. The invalid came down to the drawing-room, which was
well warmed and cheerful, on the second day after Williams arrival,
leaning on his brothers arm. The ascendency over him which Annie
had gained in the sickroom she managed to maintain still; and the
artless William would make gestures of admiration and astonishment at
Harrys docility to her from behind her husbands back, and there was
much unpleasantness on one or two occasions when his brother caught
him. William also made himself obnoxious by calling Harry the Ogre,
sometimes out of hearing of his elder brother and sometimes within,
and by assuming an intimate knowledge of Annies movements during the
four years of her absence from the Grange, which Harry of course did
not possess.

In these early days of her return Annie put off questions about the way
in which she had occupied those four years, and left Harry to imagine
that she had supported herself by teaching. Her skill in conversational
fence being much greater than that of either of her companions, she
could always lead the talk into what channel she would; but it was
growing a delicate matter to avoid collision between Harry and William,
each of whom considered himself to have an exclusive right to her
attention, when the situation was changed by the arrival on the same
day, though not by the same train, of Wilfred and Sir George.

William was dispatched by Annie to Beckham in the dog-cart to meet his
eldest brother, and, when he was gone, Harry, who, under his wifes
care, was getting rapidly through his convalescence, fidgeted about the
room, and at last knocked over a gypsy-table covered with trifles.

All right, Harry; Ill pick them up, said Annie, hearing a muttered
oath from her husband.

What are you in such a hurry for? I do hate a woman to be in a hurry,
said he, testily, noticing unusual haste in his wifes movements as she
knelt on the floor gathering up the things his clumsiness had scattered.

It is getting very late, and I must dress for dinner now George is
coming back.

Harry flung himself into a chair and scowled at her.

Oh, all this fuss for George! Your appearance didnt matter for me, I
suppose? Im only your husband!

My dear Harry, if you will take the trouble to think you will see
that, as, since you have been ill, you have not had late dinner, I
have not insulted you by changing my gown to see you eat toast and
mutton-broth in your dressing-gown. Besides, I should like to hide the
falling off in my looks which you were kind enough to tell me of from
George, who will not hurt my vanity by mentioning it, if he does notice
any great change.

Look here, Annie! I didnt want to hurt your feelings; I didnt think
you were vain; and--and--do you know--I really--I think sometimes, when
you tell us anything to make us laugh, for instance, you look prettier
than you ever did. You--you look so mischievous, and your eyes sparkle
so, you make one want to kiss you--only then--then, somehow, you never
seem to want to be kissed--at least not by me! he added, testily.

Annie burst out laughing, a little constrainedly perhaps.

Why, whom should I want to kiss me except my husband? said she,
carelessly, as she bent over her occupation of fitting together two
pieces of broken Dresden china.

I dont know, I am sure, said Harry, rather sulkily, feeling that his
conciliatory speech had not met with the response it deserved--George,
perhaps.

Why, surely you are not jealous of George, Harry! she cried, laughing
more naturally.

I dont know that Im not; but it wouldnt make much difference to you
if I was, would it? he asked; and, as, for one moment, she did not
answer, he walked, with the aid of the intervening chairs, from the one
on which he was sitting to one beside her, and laid his sound arm, the
right, on her shoulder. It wouldnt make any difference, would it? he
repeated.

Annie looked up rather mischievously.

I dont think it would, Harry.

This was a disconcerting answer to a husband.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between Harry and William, and to foreshadow the arrival of Wilfred and Sir George. The author achieves these goals by having Annie put off questions about her four years away, leading to tension between the brothers, and by having Harry knock over a table when he's fidgeting.
