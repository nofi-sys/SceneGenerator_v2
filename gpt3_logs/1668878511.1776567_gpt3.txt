Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Pipe dreams, the boy muttered. Weve seen all we ever shall of
Joe Marino.

Roy, quit that mumbling and speak up! Teddy exclaimed. Whats on
your mind?

The Pup, for one thing, Roy answered grimly. Hes got a horse of
ours, and four hundred dollars. I hate to let him get away with a
raw thing like that without an effort to catch him.

Well make more than an effort, Roy, when we get this cattle
business finished, Mr. Manley called back. Well have every
sheriff in the state on his trail, and maybe well take a hand in it
ourselves. He was the man who put Gus on the bum. I cant forget
that.

Theres another little item that sticks in my mind, Teddy remarked
in a low voice. It happened near the corral the night the horse and
the money were stolen. Guess you know what I mean, Roy. Though Id
rather have it sticking in my mind than in my chest, he added
significantly.

The knife with J. K. on it, Roy returned. Sure, I know, Teddy.
But the sooner we forget The Pup the better. Hes gone. If we catch
him, fine! If not--well, charge it up to profit and loss.

Thats the right idea, Roy, Mr. Manley agreed. Weve got enough
on our hands now. If we get our cattle back Ill be satisfied.

I suppose I ought to be--and maybe Ill have to be; but it sure
sticks in my craw to let a thing like that get by me! muttered
Teddy.

The gloom of evening was at hand, and the men rode in close
formation, talking in subdued tones. Pop and Bug Eye were ahead,
leading. Roy and Teddy brought up the rear, their father riding just
ahead of them. They had planned to cover as much distance as
possible before dark, so that when morning came they would be near
enough to the rustlers to seize them before they had a chance to
escape.

They soon came to the lowlands just beyond the range of Whirlpool
River Ranch. The air here was damp and chill, due to the moisture
from the river which had settled in the depressions. To add to this,
the night promised to be cloudy, with no moon showing. Already the
dull, gray canopy was curtaining the evening sky, cutting off, in
the fullness of its glory, the western sunset.

This is the first real touch of fall weve had, Roy remarked,
buttoning his shirt collar higher. Then, raising his voice: Where
are you figuring to stop, Dad? Going to ride part of the night?

Mr. Manley, the better to reply, wheeled his pony and circled back
toward his son.

Nope, he answered. Soon as we top this rise ahead well call a
halt. We sure dont want to camp in this place. Golly, its damp!
and he shivered slightly.

The leaders of the column quickened their pace, so that they might
leave the lowlands as quickly as possible. Pop, like most old
ranchmen, had his pet superstitions, and one of them was that it was
unlucky to stay long in such a place.

Things happen, he declared vaguely. The mountains are all
right--dont care how high they are. Open range is all right. But
every time I ride through land that sets low, I get a feelin that
somethin is goin to turn up. Dont know why, but I do.

Ever hear that dampness was bad for rheumatism? Teddy chuckled.
That might have something to do with it, Pop.

No sir, and Pop shook his head obstinately. Its got nothin to
do with rheumatism. Even Nat Raymonds pony knows what I mean. Look
at the way hes actin.

In truth, the bronco Nat rode, which had come from the home ranch
with him, was acting queerly. The pony would come to a dead stop,
lift its head, whinny, and proceed. This performance was repeated
several times.

Mr. Manley observed the horse with interest.

What makes him do that, Nat? he asked. You pullin him up?

Not any, boss. Nat answered sincerely. Hes doin it himself.
Like Pop said, I guess, he dont like lowlands.

Seems to me as though he sensed a stranger around, Teddy said to
Roy in a low tone. Ive seen Nats bronco do that before, when a
new man came into the yard of the X Bar X. Its got nothing to do
with the place were in now.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with Roy and Teddy discussing their plans to catch the Pup, the man who stole their horse and money. They are joined by their father, who tells them that they need to focus on their current task and not worry about the Pup. The three men then ride off into the evening, heading for the lowlands near the Whirlpool River Ranch.
As they ride, the air grows damp and chill, and the night becomes cloudy. They soon come to a rise and decide to camp there for the night, as they do not want to camp in the lowlands.
As they make camp, they discuss Pop's superstition that it is unlucky to stay in lowlands. Suddenly, Nat's pony begins acting strangely, stopping and whinnying as if sensing something. Teddy comments that the pony has done this before when there was a stranger around.
The men then settle down for the night, keeping watch in shifts. During Teddy's shift, he hears a noise and wakes the others. They discover that the Pup is trying to steal their horses.
The men give chase, but the Pup gets away. They return to camp and discuss their options. They decide to split up and search for the Pup in pairs. Teddy and Roy will take the lowlands while their father and Pop take the highlands.
As they search, Teddy and Roy find themselves growing more and more tired. Suddenly, they see the Pup in the distance. They give chase, but he gets away again. They return to their father and Pop, who have also had no luck.
The men then decide to head back to the ranch. As they ride, they discuss their options. They decide to put up flyers with the Pup's description and offer a reward for his capture. They also decide to notify the sheriff and ask for their help.
