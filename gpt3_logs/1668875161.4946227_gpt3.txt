SCENE:
I hope there is nothing the matter with his head, thought Annie,
anxiously, as she got into the carriage.

Annie went to the station to meet her sister-in-law, without any of the
nervousness she had once felt before an interview with that imperious
beauty. If Lilian should resent the change in her position at the
Grange, Annie was quite ready to go, and was rather hoping that Mrs.
Falconers arrival might pave the way for her own departure. She bought
the _Era_ on her entrance into the station, and, having some minutes to
wait before the train from London was due, went into the waiting-room,
cut the leaves of the paper roughly with a pencil she happened to have
in her pocket, and glanced through the pages eagerly. She found what
she wanted--a notice of a morning performance in which she knew that
Aubrey Cooke was to play a part; and, with flushed cheeks and beating
heart, she read that he had made the chief success in the piece, in a
character so well played that the critic pronounced him the coming
comedian. Annie knew that this sentence was one she had heard before
of other young actors who never came to anything in particular. But
her pleasure in reading this testimony to his talent was none the less
great, and with trembling fingers, she almost involuntarily drew a
shaky line with her pencil down that part of the notice which referred
to him.

She was looking brilliant when she met Lilian, who complimented her on
her appearance, and said she had heard from her brothers that she would
now have to subside meekly into the second place, since Annie had grown
into such a charming woman.

But you might have let me know you were on the stage, said Lilian,
with good-humored reproach. I find now that I know several of the
actors who were with you at the Regency. And only think! I went there
one night when you were playing in the piece, and never recognized you.

I recognized you, though.

Did you? Can you see people you know among the audience when you are
acting?

Oh, yes! And I saw Colonel Richardson.

Most people can see him when you are about, broke in Stephen, who
had come from town with his cousin, but had sat silent in the carriage
until now.

This was a bolder speech than he would have ventured to make in the old
times to Lilian, Annie thought. She noted that the cripple had grown
much older-looking; his face, which had once been handsome, was thin
and wasted, and he looked sullen and discontented.

Lilian took no notice of his remark, and asked Annie if she had seen
many of the people of the neighborhood since she had been at the Grange.

Yes, most of them have called, to my surprise, since William let out
to old Mrs. Knowles that I had been on the stage. She and her niece
made a tentative call, and I suppose the rumor spread that I did
not bite, so everybody came and praised my wifely devotion, which I
certainly did not deserve.

Lilian laughed.

Harry ill must be a great trial, though.

He is rather; he has such strange freaks.

Husbands always have, dear. Only fancy--my husband wanted to prevent
my coming to the Grange!

Really? For what reason?

Oh, he disapproves of my brothers, or some such nonsense! said Lilian
lightly.

But Stephen raised his eyes to his cousins face with a penetrating
look which Annie noted and remembered.

Dinner that night was a banquet of rejoicing. The two ladies were both,
in different ways, among the most charming women of the day. Lilian
was very handsomely dressed in dark red velvet, which showed off her
fair, queenly beauty well; Annie, in maize-colored silk, with soft
folds of Indian muslin about the throat, looked like a little fairy.
The style of each was so different from that of the other that their
attractions did not clash, and Annies quiet, simple manner of saying
amusing things was the best contrast possible to Lilians laughing
impertinences.

Lilian was very anxious to know at once all about her sister-in-laws
stage-experiences, and was seized with a strong desire to become an
actress herself.

Dont you find people off the stage very dull after the nice, amusing
people you meet in the theater? she asked at dinner.
