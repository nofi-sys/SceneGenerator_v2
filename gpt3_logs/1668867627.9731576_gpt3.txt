SCENE:
XIV INGOTS OF GOLD


No luck that time, lads, the skipper went on to say, as soon as they
detached the big heavy helmet that had been securely fastened to its
base, resting on his shoulders. I scoured every part of the old hulk
I could reach, but it seems that in all these years the bars have been
knocked about, and perhaps many of them are buried deep under the sand
if they ever got outside the shell of the wreck.

Now was Oscars chance to mention what he had on his mind.

Id like to take a turn down below, Captain, if you dont object, he
said.

The skipper looked at him quizzically.

Id be only too glad of the chance for a new recruit, if only you knew
the ropes, lad, he observed seriously. Both of my men are tired out,
and need a spell of rest. Its no childs play to stay down there an
hour at hard work.

But I have been down in a divers suit before, protested Oscar.

You dont tell me! ejaculated Captain Shooks; well, itd be hard
to run across any sort of game you boys havent tried. Where did it
happen, lad?

Oscar explained in as few words as possible.

So you see I know a little about the business, he continued,
believing he had made some sort of an impression on the commander. I
would promise to be very careful, and not take any unnecessary risks.
So say yes, Captain. There is just time between now and sunset for
a little look around, and I want to see what the inside of the old
Spanish galleon is like.

Captain Shooks smiled as though a pleasant thought had flashed through
his mind. These Motion Picture Comrades had a great record for being
lucky. Many things they had told him connected with their previous
exploits pointed to that as a positive fact. Hence, it might be a wise
thing for him to let one of them take a hand in searching the old
wreck. If that little cherub aloft that seemed to be guarding their
fortunes continued on the job, possibly something fine might come out
of the little look-in Oscar declared he wanted.

Well, have your own way, lad, have your own way, he told Oscar; only
if you do get into any trouble dont try to shove the blame on to me.

Everything will work all right, Captain, I promise you that, said
the boy, who felt a thrill pass over him at the thought of being about
to go down, just as these veteran divers had been doing, and prowling
around there amidst that strange waving growth, where all sorts of
queer creatures might have their abiding places.

And then there was the old hulk of the Spanish galleon, too, with all
its romantic association; Oscar wondered whether he would run across
any grisly reminder of the fact that human beings once walked that
sloping deck, and that they had gone down centuries back with the
ancient ship to an ocean grave.

The two divers had listened to all this talk with more or less
interest. They knew that if the captain figured they should work
throughout the night, taking turns, they would have all they could
reasonably do; and if Oscar was able to spell them as he suggested
doing it would be something gained. Besides this, they had come to
take a great interest in the trio of venturesome chums, having, with
considerable interest, heard them tell of their previous undertakings.

They commenced rigging the boy up in the suit worn by Hicks, the first
man who had gone down. As they worked they told Oscar many things, both
with regard to how he should manage the air pipe, and the life line.
Besides this they explained to him as well as was possible, just how
the wreck lay, and what he must do in order to keep from getting caught
in the same.

Finnegan, a warm-hearted Irishman, also told the boy where he had
discovered the three bars which came up by rope.

Sure the trend all sames to be in thot direction, me bye, he
concluded, as he got ready to affix the headpiece that would complete
Oscars diving armor. Look beyant the place where I set three stones,
wan on top av the rist. Twas mesilf meant to continue me labors in the
same quarrter av I wint down agin.

Ill remember that, Finnegan, the boy told him thankfully.

Ballyhoo insisted on shaking hands with Oscar.

Look here, dont get the notion in your head, the latter told him,
laughingly, that its good-bye this time for good. I expect to come
up again in good shape. If you keep your head about you theres little
danger, Hicks says.
