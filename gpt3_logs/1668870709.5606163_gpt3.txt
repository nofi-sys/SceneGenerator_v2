Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
I go till wurk in the mornin, said he with a rapturous smile. Young
Nolan is a man av his wurd; he promised me a job at the first chance,
an now he have give me wan. McQuirk an his political bums kin go till
the devil, for me!

Good luck, lad, wished the grocer. Gartenheim is the man for yez
till stick till.

He have the contract for layin the sewer above, at Frankford, went
on Burns; an hell start till open the strate tmorry.

Nolans a good guy, commented Jerry.

Thats no joke, agreed McGonagle. Hes a real good ting.

Its a pity, commented Clancy, that his mother is so tuck up wid the
sup av drink.

Ay! said Tim, shaking his head dismally.

She hocks everyting she kin carry, said McGonagle. Dick cant trust
her wit a cent.

Small blame till him, said Clancy; shed git drink wid it. He comes
in an pays me bill every Saturday noight himself, poor by.

Makes big money, too, remarked McGonagle; and she cud live like a
lady if shed cut the bottle. Its hard lines for Dick, leme tell
youse; for hes a hard worker, an hes got mighty big notions bout
gittin to the top o the heap.

That sister o his is a nice-lookin fairy, said McGonagle.

Poody as a bicture, agreed Schwartz. OHara gave a grunt; the barber
snatched away his blade and inquired, Does der razor hurd?

Yez damned near cut me chin! growled the dealer in second-hand goods.
Shut up, an tind till yez wurk.

Shes a nice girl enough, said Jerry, but, say, shes certny
playin Roddy Ferguson for a dead one.

An is Roddy shparkin her, sure? inquired Clancy.

Sure! I never seen anybody so broke up on a bundle o skirts in me
life. Say, hes dead twisted about her; he talks about her every time
he opens his mouth.

Roddys a study by, said Burns. I heerd that OConnorll be takin
him intill the bizness wan av these days. Its a good man hed make
her.

Dicks leary on him, said McGonagle, he wont let her even look at
him.

Dyez say so! And Clancy regarded the speaker with great surprise.
Faith an I tought they wur great buddies. They wint till the
Brothers School together, an in thim days, divil a long they wur iver
apart.

Why its a chestnut! exclaimed McGonagle. I tought everybody in the
ward was next to that. Theyve bin given each other the stony smile
ever since las election, when OConnor and Gartenheim run against each
other for select council.

Ach! cried Schwartz, dot vas a hod dime!

The warmest ever, agreed McGonagle. It was a reglar drag out or I
never seen one.

Wur they not both Dimmycrats? asked Tim. What call had they till
foight, I dunno? I wur in the division at the toime, sure, bud I niver
got the roight av the ting.

Why, when the gang went to the convention they was split an primed
for trouble, see? One crowd wanted OConnor, an the other was
a-fracturin their suspenders whoopin tings up for Gartenheim. And
when the OConnor push got the bulge, the Dutchmans people broke
for the door, and started a convention o their own upstairs o
Swinghammers saloon. Both o em was in the fight from that on, and
the way they shovelled out the long green ed make youse tink they was
rank suckers. Why a mug couldnt turn aroun witout runnin into a
bunch o money.

Glory be!

Nolan worked for Gartenheim, of course; he couldnt turn down his
own boss, ye know. An Ferguson lectioneered for OConnor for the
same reason, see? An he chased aroun the ward waggin his face for
votes an givin Gartenheim the knife every chance he got. On election
night, continued McGonagle, proudly, we had the returns at the club
by private wire, ye know, and when Roddy was dead sure that Kelly had
flim-flammed the push, he opened up on Nolan an said that Gartenheim
had been workin wit the other side, all along. In a minute they was
clinched an the crowd had to pull em apart. Thats how it is.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

In the morning, Burns tells the others that he has been given a job by Nolan. He is excited about the prospect of working for a good boss. The others congratulate him and wish him luck.
McGonagle comments that Nolan is a good guy, but his mother is an alcoholic and this causes problems for him. Clancy agrees, saying that she is a burden on him.
Tim says that it is a shame, and Jerry adds that her drinking habits are preventing her from living a better life.
O'Hara grunts in agreement, and Schwartz says that she is a pretty woman.
McGonagle then says that Nolan's sister is also attractive, and Jerry comments that she is playing Roddy Ferguson for a fool.
Clancy asks if Roddy is interested in her, and Jerry says that he is. He adds that Dick is protective of her and doesn't want her to get involved with anyone.
Burns then says that O'Connor is going to take Roddy into the business, and McGonagle says that Dick is wary of him.
Clancy is surprised to hear this, as he thought they were friends.
 McGonagle explains that they are not on good terms because of the election. He goes on to say that the election was a heated one, and both men are still sore about it.
O'Hara interrupts to say that it was a bad time, and McGonagle agrees, saying that it was a "regular drag out."
He explains that the two men were fighting for the same position, and when one of them won, the other's supporters left and started their own convention.
Both men were in the fight from that point on, and they spent a lot of money on it.
Nolan worked for Gartenheim, and Ferguson campaigned for O'Connor.
On election night, when Roddy realized that Kelly had tricked the push, he accused Gartenheim of working with the other side.
This led to a fight between him and Nolan, and the two had to be pulled apart.
That is how the situation stands now.
