Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Upon the opposite side of the desk from us was another doorway directly
behind Nah-ee-lah, and in the instant that she saw Sagroth fall, she
called to me in a low voice: Come, Julian, quick! Or we, too, are
lost.

Realizing that the Jemadar was dead and that it would be folly to remain
and attempt to fight this whole roomful of warriors, I leaped the desk
and followed Nah-ee-lah through the doorway beyond. There was a cry,
then, from someone within the room, to stop us, but Nah-ee-lah wheeled
and slammed the door in their faces as they rushed forward, fastened it
upon our side and then turned to me.

Julian, she said, how can you ever forgive me? You who have risked
your life for the Jemadar, my father, in spite of the contemptible
treatment that in my ignorance I have accorded you?

I could have explained, I said, but you would not let me. Appearances
were against me, and so I cannot blame you for thinking as you did.

It was wicked of me not to listen to you, Julian, but I thought that
Ko-tah had won you over, as he has won over even some of the staunchest
friends of Sagroth.

You might have known, Nah-ee-lah, that, even could I have been disloyal
to your father, I never could have been disloyal to his daughter.

I did not know, she said. How could I?

There suddenly came over me a great desire to take her in my arms and
cover those lovely lips with kisses. I could not tell why this
ridiculous obsession had seized upon me, nor why, of a sudden, I became
afraid of little Nah-ee-lah, the Moon Maid. I must have looked very
foolish indeed, standing there looking at her, and suddenly I realized
how fatuous I must appear, and so I shook myself and laughed.

Come, Nah-ee-lah, I said, we must not remain here. Where can I take
you, that you will be safe?

Upon the outer terrace there may be some of the loyal guards, she
replied, but if Ko-tah has already taken the palace, flight will be
useless.

From what I know of the conspiracy, it will be useless, I replied,
for the service of Sagroth and his palace is rotten with the spies and
retainers of the Javadar.

I feared as much, she said. The very men who came to assassinate
Sagroth wore the imperial livery less than an ola since.

Are there none, then, loyal to you? I asked her.

The Jemadars guard is always loyal, she said, but they number scarce
a thousand men.

How may we summon them? I asked.

Let us go to the outer terraces and if there are any of them there we
can congregate the balance, or as many of them as Ko-tah has left
alive.

Come, then, I said, let us hasten; and together, hand in hand, we
ran along the corridors of the Jemadars palace to the outer terraces of
the highest tier of Laythe. There we found a hundred men, and when we
had told them of what had happened within the palace they drew their
swords and, surrounding Nah-ee-lah, they shouted:

To the death for Nah-ee-lah, Jemadav of Laythe!

They wanted to remain there and protect her, but I told them that there
would be nothing gained by that, that sooner or later they would be
overwhelmed by far greater numbers, and the cause of Nah-ee-lah lost.

Send a dozen men, I said to their commander, to rally all of the
loyal guards that remain alive. Tell them to come to the throne room,
ready to lay down their lives for the new Jemadav, and then let the
dozen continue on out into the city, rallying the people to the
protection of Nah-ee-lah. As for us, we will accompany her immediately
to the throne room, and there, place her upon the throne and proclaim
her ruler of Laythe. A hundred men may hold the throne room for a long
time, if we reach it before Ko-tah reaches it with his forces.

The officer looked at Nah-ee-lah questioningly.

Your command, Jemadav? he inquired.

We will follow the plan of Ju-lan the Javadar, she replied.

Immediately a dozen warriors were dispatched to rally the Imperial Guard
and arouse the loyal citizens of the city to the protection of their new
Jemadav, while the balance of us conducted Nah-ee-lah by a short course
toward the throne room.
