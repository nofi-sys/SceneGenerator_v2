SCENE:
Quietly, Wayne Randall slipped through to the corridor and went down
to the deserted street. There was no cab or for that matter no moving
vehicle of any kind in sight. He started walking, his thoughts filled
with dark foreboding.

Wayne knew now that there was something worse than fear of death. Of
all the people on earth, he suddenly realized, only he would not feel
the effect of this unknown sleep-producing agency. His dendrites didn't
contract, they had said. Maybe he didn't have any dendrites, whatever
they were.

Yes, worse than the fear of death was the stark, overwhelming fear of
being completely, utterly alone. Probably within a few hours, a day
at most, he would be the only person awake in Chicago, in the United
States, in the world! Left awake to watch humanity die. Even sweet,
radiant Marcia, whom he had just found.

Resolutely, he thrust the thought away. He must keep his mind clear,
until he was certain there was nothing he could do. There would be
time for demoralization, madness. Plenty of time.

He must think coldly, logically. The air was normal. It was suspected
the influence possessed electrical properties. A field, perhaps? Some
sort of electro-magnetic field that affected neurons? Why not? What man
didn't know about electrobiology would fill volumes.

Even in radio, his own field, there was plenty of scope for research.
A sudden hope shot swiftly through Wayne's mind. There were powerful
broadcasting stations scattered all over Earth, and their waves covered
all of the globe. Would it be possible to send out waves, short or
long, which would damper or neutralize the menacing field?

It seemed such a desperately slim chance, there was so little time in
which to work--but it was a chance, nonetheless. And Wayne determined
to exhaust it thoroughly.

Spotting a cab parked across the street, he yelled at the driver,
and ran toward him. Loud snoring came from the front seat. Wayne tried
frantically to wake the cabbie, but hard and repeated slaps on the back
only changed the tempo of the snores. Finally Wayne pushed him to one
side, slid behind the wheel and a moment later was speeding through the
desolate streets toward Station WRV.

WRV, he knew, would be the best bet. Not only was it one of the
most powerful stations in the country, but there was an excellent
experimental laboratory equipped for research. And perhaps it was even
possible that one of the technicians or research men had struck upon
the same idea.

It was dawn when he parked the cab in front of the big building that
housed the broadcasting station. The policeman on guard at the doorway
was--sound asleep. Wayne ran past him and up the stairs. He'd been here
before, as a visitor, and knew where the laboratory and workshop were
located.

A haggard, red-eyed man in overalls that had been pulled on over
pajamas met him at the open doorway of the lab.

"Thought I heard someone coming. You a research man? I'm Grayson.
Look"--he waved a hand that pointed first to one part of the spacious
laboratory and then another--"all asleep. I'm holding out on caffeine
citrate. Took ten grains."

Wayne peeled off his coat, tossed it on a chair, and stepped across a
figure lying prone on the floor.

"Got anything yet?" he asked tensely.

"Not much." Grayson swayed on his feet as he spoke. "Guess it's too
late, but I'm going out trying. You look fresh, maybe you can carry on.
Here, let me show you."

He led the way across the room to a huge mechanism.

"Burkewell super-microscope. Living nerve-tissue in a nutrient solution
in focus. There's the projection. See those curly little things,
retracted? Rogers, the biologist, set it up for us before he passed
out."

"Any clues as to the nature of the field?"

Grayson lighted a cigaret with trembling fingers.

"We can't even prove there is one. None of our instruments show a
thing. It's only living tissue that shows any effect. We deduce a field
just because it _can't_ be chemical. Good old Chicago air. Checked
fifty ways. Qualitative and quantitative tests."

Wayne bent over the chassis of a small transmitter that was already
plugged into operation, tubes glowing brightly.
