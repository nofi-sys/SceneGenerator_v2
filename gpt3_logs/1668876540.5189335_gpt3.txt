SCENE:
XII

SMOKED-GLASSES


Saidee Isaacs was the first to recover her voice and reason. She seized
Fays left arm and drew him away from the edge of the cliff. She feared
that he might cast himself into the sea.

You shouldnt have thrown them away, she said quickly. Chesteryou
should have looked them over carefully. Perhaps

Im done! To think what a fool Ive been. Weve both been gulled. It is
the end of a wild-goose chaseif ever there was one!

She let go of his arm. Her face lifted to his. She saw his eyes flash
out and over the sea. A bitter light was in their depths. Defiance
flamed there. He squared his shoulders and dropped his hands to his
sides.

Come on! he said. Lets go inland and find out where we are. We can
get a railroad train or something for the north. The country is full of
refugees and broken soldiers. No one will notice us. We can go to
Stavanger and then to the States.

She furrowed her brows and blocked his way by thrusting her body before
him.

We mustnt leave here yet! she declared positively. Youve done
something you shouldnt have done. Suppose the key was written on the
wrapping paper of that package. Suppose the smoked-glasses were
hollowor something like that. We wouldnt expect the key to be right
out in plain view. I wonder if there is any way to get them back?

Get them back? No! I never want to see them! Im doneI say! They were
ordinary glasses like beggars or blind men buy for a shilling. There was
nothing on the wrapper or the box. The whole thing was a hoaxor an
accident.

Do you think that the embassy would put such a thing in the inner box
of their strongest safe?

They didnt know what was in the package.

But, Chester, they refused to give it upeither to Germany or to
England. They knew it was important. They knew that the commercial war
was on. The signing of peace had nothing to do with the dye secrets.
They belong to the man who is strong enough and clever enough to get
them. You got the key to the whole thingthen threw it away.

Fay stared back over the pathway. He hesitated, then turned toward the
girl. Her eyes were dark and smoldering. She was very sure of herself.
The fire within her had reddened her olive cheeks. Her lips had
hardened.

I despise you! she said. Youre so thoughtless! You overlook the
trifles of life. What are we going to say to Sir Richard?

Sir Richard will never find me. You can go back! Im going to the
States. Im done, I tell you!

She realized that he was not to be moved from his declaration.

How deep is the water where you threw the glasses? she asked as he did
not move from his position.

Fifty or sixty feet, Saidee. Theres an undertow and tides and waves.
Its no use! Lets forget the smoked-glasses and go to Stavanger. Weve
got a right to live in this world. Has the Yard any strings on you?

She did not answer him. Instead, she stepped to the edge of the cliff
and glanced downward. She swayed, braced her foot and stood there in an
attitude of thought. Finally she turned and came back to him.

Her hand clutched his left arm as she drew him toward the side rocks and
a shelter from the wind. She spread her damp skirt and sat down upon a
driftwood plank which someone had carried up from the sea. She dropped
her face in her hands. He watched her.

Quit that! he said with feeling. What are you doingcrying?

She glanced up swiftly. Her eyes were bright and free from tears. Im
thinking, Chester, she said, of a number of things. Im not like other
womenor girls. I can hate and I can despise. I almost hate you, now.
Your friends are Sir Richard and MacKeenon. They helped me get you out
of Dartmoor. You say they did it for a purpose. Granting that does not
change matters. The purpose is a high one. You responded at first. You
took their parole and went to Holland. Now, when you may have held the
key to the dye cipher in your hand, you threw it away. You talk of going
to Stavanger and to the States. Dont you realize the obligation you owe
to me?
