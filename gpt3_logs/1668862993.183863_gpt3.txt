SCENE:
Then youd better go upstairs and sleep. Mr. Budd says hell watch your
prisoner till night.

And what then? asked Hugh. We cant just saddle up and hit the trail
for Carson. Never in the world get there. By this time theyve wired to
Ralph Dodson. Hes on the job at the other end of the line.

What makes you think so? Vicky asked.

Because Bob Dodson hired Dutch to shoot Scot. He showed it when he lit
out with him in the middle of the night. Dodson has got to stand by
Dutch to keep him from telling all he knows. Hes sure sent a hurry-up
call for help to brother Ralph. Their play is to prevent me from
reaching Carson with Dutch a prisoner. Once there, with feeling in the
town high against him, the killer would be liable to tell who was back
of the shooting. Hed do it out of revenge because he had not been
rescued.

I can telegraph to Carson for help and have friends come and meet you.

That would mean a pitched battle. Cant have that.

Oh, well, you go to bed and sleep, Vicky said imperatively. We can
decide later about how youre going to reach Carson.

Hugh nodded. Youll have me wakened if any word comes about Scot?

Of course.

Within a few minutes both men, and Dutch, too, were sound asleep. It was
late in the afternoon when Mrs. Budd knocked on Hughs door to awaken
him.

He found Vicky waiting for him in the sitting room.

You look better, she said.

I feel a hundred years younger, he answered. Any news about Scot?

No.

Ill leave to-night. Cant stay away any longer.

Yes. That would be best.

Is the house watched?

Yes.

Cant help it. Ill go soon as Ive eaten.

Im going, too, she told him. I ought to be with Mollie.

You come to-morrownot to-day. There may be trouble.

No, there wont be any troubleand Im going with you, she answered.
There was a queer little smile on her face, a smile of friendly mockery.

Im not going alone, you know, he explained. Dutch travels with me.

Then therell be three of us. She stepped to the kitchen door, but
before she opened it mirth bubbled in her face and broke to laughter.
Come in, Mr. Dutch. We start on a long journey about dusk.

Dutch shuffled into the roomat least the man was Dutch in walk, in
manner, dress, and beard. Hugh looked at him again, and still a third
time, before he discovered that this was Jim Budd made up for the part
of the desperado.

The young mans puzzled eyes asked a question of Vicky.

We three are going after supper, she explained. Their lookout is over
at Schmidts blacksmith shop. Mr. Budd will seem to have his hands tied.
Of course hell think its your prisoner.

If Jim doesnt begin to tell him all about old Grimes, McClintock said
drily.

Yes, you mustnt sing, Mr. Budd. You know there arent many voices like
yours, the girl replied, laughing. Hell notify his friends, and
theyll follow us. Probably theyll telegraph ahead that were coming.
Very likely a welcome party will come to meet us. By that time Mr. Budd
will be Mr. Budd, and somebody will be sold.

Good enough, agreed Hugh. But havent you forgot one small detail?
The real Dutch has got to go to Carson. Thats what I came here forto
get him.

Hell go. As soon as the sheriffs posse has clattered past after us,
Mr. Byers and your prisoner will take a very quiet walk up the gulch and
round Bald Knob. Horses are waiting there somewhere; I dont know just
where. Your friend the lumberjack with the axe handle took them. He and
Mr. Byers will ride across the hills with the prisoner to Carson.
