SCENE:
III.

THE SYREN AND THE MOB.

And after all the raskal many ran,
Heaped together in rude rabblement.
SPENSER.

What intricate impeach is this?
I think you all have drunk of Circes cup!
SHAKSPEARE.


The woman continued, with calm, regular breathings, to sleep for
several hours. The dusk of evening had now closed in, and yet her
patient guardian sat silently watching her motionless figure. A long
and serene self-communion had gradually restored the excellent doctor
to his ordinary equanimity, and he now, with untiring vigilance,
awaited the changes that might supervene in the condition of the
patient.

After all his thinking on the subject, he found himself now no
nearer comprehending the cause of the late unwonted disturbance of
his habitual serenity than at the beginning. He had dealt harshly
with himself, in endeavoring to account for it, and never dreamed of
reproaching the feeble and wretched being before him, as in any degree
the conscious agent of what he considered a weakness unpardonable in
himself.

With the natural proclivity of generous souls towards the extremes,
he had, in the plenitude of his self-reproach, proceeded to exalt the
sleeping woman into an earth-visiting angel with wounded wings, the
spotless purity of which the breath of his darkened thought had soiled.
The poor, good-hearted doctor!

The silence of the room was now broken by a low exclamation of fright,
accompanied by a slight movement of the patient. The doctor sprang
forward softly to the bedside.

Who?what?where am I? What has been happening? asked the woman,
with an expression of bewilderment and alarm.

Nothing! nothing, my dear madam! I am hereyou are safebut you must
not talk.

Where is he? is he gone? she persisted in a wild, terrified manner.

Yes, he is gone. He shall not come back to disturb you again. You must
be quiet now, and get well. Please be calm, and trust in me.

Trust in thee? said the patient, in a voice which had instantly lost
its vague tone. Trust in thee, thou minister of light, who hast come
to my darkened pillow, to my bloody death-bed, to console me! and here
she clutched his hand. Trust theeI would trust thee as I trust God!
and she pressed his hand to her heart.

You must be silent, madam, urged the physician, endeavoring to
extricate his imprisoned hand, for he felt strange tinglings along his
veins, which alarmed his now penitent and vigilant spirit. She only
shook her head, and clung with yet greater tenacity to his hand, and
then, first raising it to her lips with a reverential kiss, she placed
it upon the top of her head, with the palm outstretched, and signified
her desire that he should keep it there, with a smile of entire
beatitude. The doctor barely knew enough of mesmeric manipulations,
to understand that this laying-on of hands was commonly resorted to
among the believers in the science, as a remedy for nervous headache.
He could see no harm in the innocent formula, if it assisted the
imagination in throwing off pain, and he very willingly humored his
poor patient, in permitting his hand to remain there.

In a moment or two a singular change came over the face and general
physical expression of the woman, and the doctor, who had witnessed
something of mesmeric phenomena, instantly recognised this as clearly
presenting all the symptoms of such a case. He had mesmerised her by a
touch, and it was not without a thrill of vague wonder that he awaited
further developments.

There was a perfect silence of ten minutes duration, when the
mesmerised patient began moving her lips as if in the effort to
articulate. The curiosity of the doctor was now fully arousedhis
_will_ became concentratedhe desired to hear her speak; in his
unconscious eagerness, he _willed_ that she should do so with all the
energy of his firm nature; and speak she did.

Happy! happy! Ah, I am content in this pure sphere! My soul can rest
here! a long pause, then suddenly a shudder vibrated through her
frame, and she shrank back as one appalled by some spectral horror.

Ha! it is all dark now! I see! I see! his hand is red! red! red! red!
There is murder on this soul!
