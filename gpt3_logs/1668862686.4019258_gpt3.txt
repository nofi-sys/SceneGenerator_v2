What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Hugh sat in a corner with his back to the wall. He was protected by his
position from any attack except a frontal one, in case the companions of
Dutch moved to come to his rescue. They had, in point of fact, no such
intention. Though Dutch belonged to their gang, he had always been an
obnoxious bully. He was a quarrelsome, venomous fellow, and more than
once had knifed or shot those of his own crowd. Nobody liked him, least
of all those who had accepted him as leader.

Three-Fingered Jack leaned back with his elbows hitched on the bar and
grinned cynically as he listened to the whining of the huge ruffian.

He claims to be a man-eater, Sam does, he whispered to Daily. Calls
himself Chief of Main Street. Fine. Well let him play his own hand. He
sure wouldnt want us interferin against a kid. All night Ive listened
to his brags about what all hed do to this McClintock guy. Now Im
waitin to see him do it.

Whats eatin the kid? demanded Daily, also in a whisper. Why dont
he plug loose with the fireworks? You cant monkey with Sam. First thing
he knows he wont know a thing, that kid wont. Hell be a sure enough
corpus delinqui.

But Hugh took no chances. He knew what he was waiting for. Thirty
minutes by the watch he held the desperado prisoner. When Dutch got
restless he tapped the table three times with his finger tip, and the
man began to sweat fear again. The big bully never knew at what moment
the boy might crook his finger.

Youre goin on a journey, Hugh explained at last. Youre takin the
stage outa town. The Candelabria one is the first that leaves. So youre
booked for a seat in it. And youre not buyin a return trip ticket.
Understand?

Dutch understood humbly and gratefully. His gratitude was not to this
fool of a boy whom he meant to destroy some day, but to the luck which
was bringing him alive out of the tightest hole he had ever been in.

Under orders from Hugh the bartender disarmed Dutch. Still covered by
the shotgun, the sullen dethroned chief climbed into the stage that was
about to leave.

From a saloon farther down the street a Negros mellow voice was lifted
in song:

Ole Dan and I, we did fall out,
An what you tink it was about?
He tread on my corn an I kick him on de shin,
An dats de way dis row begin.

So git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,
Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,
Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,
Youre too late to come to supper.

A crowd had gathered on the street. It watched with eagerness the taming
of this bad man. In the old fighting West nobody was more despised than
a cowed man-eater. The good citizen who went about his business and
made no pretensions held the respect of the community. Not so the gunman
whose bluff had been called.

On the outskirts of the crowd a quiet manhe was Captain J. A. Palmer
and he had nerves of steeltook up the chorus of the song derisively.
Others began to hum it, at first timidly, then more boldly:

Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,
Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,
Git out de way, ole Dan Tucker,
Youre too late to come to supper.

Before the last verse the song was going with a whoop. Nearly everybody
present had sidestepped Dutch. Many had gone in fear of his vicious,
erratic temper. It was a great relief to see him humiliated and driven
away.

Dutch looked neither to the right nor to the left. He sat hunched in his
seat, head down and teeth clenched. At any moment the demonstration
might turn into a lynching bee now that Aurora had lost its fear of him.

The stage rolled away in a cloud of dust.

Hugh turned, to find himself facing Captain Palmer.

Dont you know better than to let Sam Dutch get away alive after youve
got the drop on him? Palmer asked.

I couldnt kill him in cold blood.

Hmp! Hed have killed you that way, wouldnt he?

Yes. But Im no murderer.
