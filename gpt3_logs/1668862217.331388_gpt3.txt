SCENE:
General Stark, I have only one request to make of you, in that case.

Umph--umph! What is it? grunted Stark, gruffly.

Allow your men to restore me my horse, which I see at your quarters,
and let me ride back to my chief.

Umph--umph! Very good, very good. Have your irons off first, eh?

No, sir, cried Adrian, fiercely; not a favor from you but my own
charger. I would sooner die than accept aught else from a man who
deserted his country in the hour of trial.

Umph--umph! Gritty lad--gritty lad--like your pluck, by jingo--keep
cool--better have a smith and a dinner, eh? Look faint--_must_ have
dinner.

This was indeed true, for Adrian had not touched food for twenty-four
hours. He was too angry, however, to accept the offer and turned away
to the door, when Starks sharp, metallic voice asked:

Well, youngster, what are you going to tell Phil, if you get there
alive?

That you refuse to fight, said Adrian, angrily.

Oh, no, no--not a bit of it, said Stark, in his quick manner; not
by a big sight, youngster. You stay with me, and Ill show you as much
fighting as any man wants, in two days.

Adrian paused, irresolute. There was something in the voice of Stark
that sounded as if he was mocking him.

What do you mean, General? he asked sullenly. If you are playing
with me, allow me to say that it is in bad taste to an officer in my
position, who has incurred danger to reach you.

The eccentric General changed his manner immediately. He came up to
Schuyler and forced him, with rough kindness, into a chair by the table.

You sit there, he said gruffly. I want to talk turkey to you.

Then he rung a bell, and as the orderly entered, he gruffly ordered up
the nearest smith and a good dinner. The orderly did not seem to be
amazed at the singular order. He was an old dragoon, who had once been
a ranger of Starks company in the French and Indian war. He saluted,
and wheeled swiftly about, departing without a word.

Now, see here, captain, began the eccentric General, as the door
closed, dont misunderstand me. Im going to keep you here, because
I know you cant get back to your General now. Burgoyne has a body of
his infernal dragoons on the road here, and to-night I march to meet
them. Ill not put myself under the orders of Congress--thats flat.
Theyve cheated Arnold and me out of our fairly-won commissions, and my
State has granted what they refuse. Im going to whip these British and
Hessian dragoons out of their boots, on my own hook, and if Congress
dont like it, they can lump it. Thats flat, too. When Ive whipped
the enemy, you can carry the news to Phil, if you please, and I shall
be glad of your help. What do you say now?

Adrian had been silent during this singular address, which was spoken
in short jerks, the General stumping round the room all the time.

When he had finished, the hussar answered:

I say youre a strange man, General; but Ill stay with you, if you
like. At all events, I can help you, till the roads clear.

Stark laughed in his abrupt manner, and clapped the other on the
shoulder, saying:

Youre the right grit, lad, and if I dont show you a few English
flags, the day after to-morrow, its because Molly Stark will be a
widow.

The door opened, and in clamped a big country blacksmith, with his
basket of tools, while his blue coat, brass scales, and tall hat-plume
showed that he had just come in from training.

Hang it, Zeke, we dont want to shoe a horse here, said Stark,
grinning. This gentleman has been unfortunate enough to fall into
British hands, and theyve ornamented him with bracelets. File them
off, so he can dine with me.

Thats me, Gineral, said the smith, affably. Ef I dont hev them
irons off in five minutes, you kin take my hat.

He was as good as his word, filing away at the irons with great vigor,
and when the tavern waiter entered with a large tray, some five minutes
later, Adrian Schuyler was rubbing his released wrists with a sense of
gratitude, while the smith, who had been cheerfully whistling over his
task, and replying affably to his Generals dry jokes, had just picked
up his basket to leave.
