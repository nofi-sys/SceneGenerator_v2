SCENE:
Did you see nothing of them? I asked in a tone of voice loud enough to
be distinctly heard by Peter, and then before Samuels could reply I
added: We have searched far up the river and never a sign of a goat
aboutI do not believe that they came this way after all; but if they
did the hellhounds will get them after dark. Come, now, we might as well
start for home and give the search up as a bad job.

I had talked so much and so rapidly that Samuels had guessed that I must
have some reason for it and so he held his peace, other than to say that
he had seen nothing of any goats. Not once had Juana or I let our
glances betray that we knew of Peters presence, though I could not help
but see him dodge behind a tree the moment that he saw us.

The three of us then continued on toward home in the shortest direction,
and on the way I whispered to Samuels what we had seen. The old man
chuckled, for he thought as I did that my ruse must have effectually
baffled Johansenunless he had followed Moses farther than we guessed.

Very cautiously during the ensuing week the word was passed around by
means with which we were familiar that Johansen had followed Samuels
from church; but as the authorities paid no more attention to Moses than
before, we finally concluded that we had thrown Peter off the trail.

The Sunday following church we were all seated in Jims yard under one
of his trees that had already put forth its young leaves and afforded
shade from the sun. We had been talking of homely thingsthe coming
crops, the newborn kids, Mollies little pigs. The world seemed
unusually kindly. The authorities had not persecuted us of laterather
they had left us alonea respite of two weeks seemed like heaven to us.
We were quite sure by this time that Peter Johansen had discovered
nothing, and our hearts were freer than for a long time past.

We were sitting thus in quiet and contentment enjoying a brief rest from
our lives of drudgery, when we heard the pounding of horses hoofs upon
the hard earth of the path that leads down the river in the direction of
the market place. Suddenly the entire atmosphere changedrelaxed nerves
became suddenly taut; peaceful eyes resumed their hunted expression.
Why? The Kash Guard rides.

And so they camefifty of them, and at their head rode Brother General
Or-tis. At the gateway of Jims house they drew rein and Or-tis
dismounted and entered the yard. He looked at us as a man might look at
carrion; and he gave us no greeting, which suited us perfectly. He
walked straight to Juana, who was seated on a little bench beside which
I stood leaning against the bole of the tree. None of us moved. He
halted before the girl.

I have come to tell you, he said to her, that I have done you the
honor to choose you as my woman, to bear my children and keep my house
in order.

He stood then looking at her and I could feel the hair upon my head
rise, and the corners of my upper lip twitchedI know not why. I only
know that I wanted to fly at his throat and kill him, to tear his flesh
with my teethto see him die! And then he looked at me and stepped
back, after which he beckoned to some of his men to enter. When they had
come, he again addressed Juana, who had risen and stood swaying to and
fro, as might one who has been dealt a heavy blow upon the head and
half-stunned.

You may come with me now, he said to her, and then I stepped between
them and faced him, and again he stepped back a pace.

She will not come with you now, or ever, I said, and my voice was very
lownot above a whisper. She is my womanI have taken her!

It was a liethe last part; but what is a lie to a man who would commit
murder in the same cause. He was among his men nowthey were close
around him and I suppose they gave him courage, for he addressed me
threateningly.

I do not care whose she is, he cried, I want her and I shall have
her. I speak for her now, and I speak for her when she is a widow. After
you are dead I have first choice of her and traitors do not live long.

I am not dead yet, I reminded him. He turned to Juana.

You shall have thirty days as the law requires; but you can save your
friends trouble if you come nowthey will not be molested then and I
will see that their taxes are lowered.

Juana gave a little gasp and looked around at us and then she
straightened her shoulders and came close to me.

No! she said to Or-tis. I will never go. This is my manhe has taken
me. Ask him if he will give me up to you. You will never have
mealive.

Dont be too sure of that, he growled. I believe that you are both
lying to me, for I have had you watched and I know that you do not live
under the same roof. And you! he glared at me. Tread carefully, for
the eyes of the law find traitors where others do not see them. Then he
turned and strode from the yard. A minute later they were gone in a
cloud of dust.
