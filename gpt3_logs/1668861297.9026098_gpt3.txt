Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Miss Denis was not nearly so much frightened now,nay, she felt
comparatively brave since _that_ was gone. She heard the near sound
of voices, and a noise of many steps hurrying downstairs. There was a
desperate struggle. In three minutes Aboo, once more a prisoner, with
his arms bound in his turban, was led up on deck, cursing and howling
and spitting like a wild cat. Here we behold Mrs. Creery, the centre
of an anxious circle, volubly narrating a story in which the personal
pronoun "I" is frequently repeated; and Helen, quite broken-down,
and trembling from head to foot, clinging to her father, looking the
picture of cowardice, as at the same moment Mrs. Creery might have sat
for the portrait of "Bellona" herself.

Miss Caggett (who had had a most satisfactory afternoon) approached the
former and examined her curiously.She was scarcely able to speak, and
was shaking like a leaf, and at this instant the General and Dr. Malone
came up from the saloon, followed by Mr. Lisle, minus his hat, his coat
in rags, and his arm in a sling. Every one looked at him for a moment
in silence, and then a torrent of words broke forthwords conveying
wonder, sympathy, and praise.

But he, scarcely noticing the crowd, went straight up to Colonel Denis
and said, "Sir, I suppose you know that your daughter has just saved my
life?"

"IIdid not," he replied, astounded at this rather abrupt address;
"I thought it was the other waythat you saved hers!"

"That fellow nearly strangled her; I'm afraid she got a fearful shock."

"Miss Denis," addressing her in a lower voice, "words seem but feeble
things after such a deed as yours; but believe me, that I shall never
forget what your courage and presence of mind have done for me to-day."

"No, no," she answered in a choked voice, shaking her head, "it was
you_you_." More she could not utter, as the recollection of her
recent ordeal flashed before her, when Aboo had his deadly clutch upon
her throat. She turned away, and hiding her face against her father's
arm, burst into tears.

"What a queer, hysterical creature!" remarked Miss Caggett _sotto
voce_ to Dr. Malone. "All this fuss, just because Mr. Lisle caught a
convict, and the convict tore his coat!"

"I think there was more in it than that," objected her listener. "The
man nearly strangled her, and he was armed; somehow she got hold of the
knife and threw it away. The story is all rather confused as yetbut
she is an uncommonly plucky girl!"

"She _looks_ it," returned Lizzie, with a malicious giggle.

"And," continued Dr. Malone, not noticing her interruption, "as for
Lisle, I always knew that he was a splendid chap."

This speech was not palatable to Miss Caggett; she tossed her head and
replied,

"_I_ see nothing splendid about him; and for that matter, Mrs. Creery
says that she saved everybody"

"Oh, of course," ironically. "I can tell you this much, that it's
well for Mrs. Creery that it was not an elegant, indolent fop that
happened to be aboard, like her friend, Mr. James Quentin; if _he_ had
fallen foul of Aboo, Aboo would have made short work of him with his
flaccid muscles and portly figure; it was ten to one on the convict,
an exceptionally powerful manhe was desperate, like a wolf in a
cage, and he was armed. However, Lisle is as hard as nails, and a very
determined fellow, and whatever Mrs. Creery may choose to say, we owe
her valuable life to _him_."

"He managed to save his own too," snapped Lizzie, as if she rather
regretted the circumstance.

"Yes, but he has got a couple of very ugly deep cutsone of them
dangerously near the jugular!"

"It strikes me as a very curious fact, that within the last two months
Mr. Lisle and Miss Denis have been concerned in two most thrilling
adventures: they were nearly drowned coming from North Bayat least,
so _she_ saysand now they have been all but murdered; a remarkable
coincidence, and really very funny."

"Funny! Miss Caggett. I think it would scarcely strike any one else in
a humorous light. It was a mere chance, and a lucky one for Miss Denis,
that she had Lisle to stand by her on both occasions."

"She is welcome to him, as far as I'm concerned," retorted the young
lady waspishly.

Dr. Malone grinned and thought of "sour grapes," and wondered if Miss
Denis was equally welcome to Apollo Quentin.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

Miss Denis, who had been previously scared, is now feeling brave after Aboo, a prisoner, is led up on deck. Mrs. Creery is in the middle of an anxious circle, telling a story in which she is the protagonist. Mr. Lisle, who saved Mrs. Creery, is being praised by everyone. Miss Caggett, however, is not impressed and finds the whole situation humorous.
