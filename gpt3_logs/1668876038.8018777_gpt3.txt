SCENE:
A light flashed upon his panel--something was in the ether. Behind
him everything was clear. Nothing was coming from Dhil. Ah, there it
was--coming in from open space. Nothing _could_ move that fast, but
this thing, whatever it might be, certainly was. It was a space-craft
of some kind. And, gods of the ancients, _how_ it was coming!

As a matter of fact the lifeboat was coming in at less than one light,
the merest crawl, as space-speeds go. Otherwise Darjeeb could not have
seen it at all. Even that velocity, however, was so utterly beyond
anything known to his solar system that the usually phlegmatic Uhalian
sat spellbound--appalled--for a fraction of a second. Then every organ
leaping convulsively in the realization that that incredible thing was
actually happening, he drove one hand toward a control.

Too late--before the hand had covered half the distance, the
incomprehensibly fast ship had struck his own in direct central impact.
In fact, before he even realized what was happening it was all over!
The strange vessel had struck and had stopped dead-still--without a jar
or shock, without even a vibration!

Both ships should have been blasted to atoms--but there the stranger
was, poised motionless beside him. Then, under the urge of a
ridiculously tiny jet of flame, she leaped away, covering a distance
of miles in the twinkling of an eye. Then something else happened. She
moved aside, drifting heavily backward _against_ the stupendous force
of her full driving blast!

As soon as he recovered from his shock, Darjeeb's cold, keen brain
began to function in its wonted fashion.

Only one explanation was possible--_inertialessness_!

What a weapon! With that and Luda--even without Luda--the solar system
was his. No longer was it a question of Uhal overcoming Dhil. With
inertialessness, he himself would become the dictator, not only of Uhal
and Dhil and Lune, but also of all the worlds within reach.

That vessel and its secrets _must_ be his!

He blasted, then, to match the inert velocity of the smaller craft. As
his ship crept toward the other he reached out both telepathically--he
could neither speak nor hear--and with a spy-ray, to determine the most
feasible method of taking over this godsend.

Bipeds! Peculiar little beasts--repulsive. Only two arms and two
eyes--only one head. Weak, soft, fragile, but they might have weapons.
No, no weapons--good! Couldn't _any_ of them communicate? Ah yes, there
was one--an unusually thin, reed-like specimen, bundled up in layer
after layer of fabric....

_I perceive that you are the survivors of some catastrophe in outer
space. Tell your pilot to open up, so that I may come aboard and
guide you to safety_, Darjeeb began. He correlated instantly, if
unsympathetically, the smashed panel and the pilot's bleeding head. If
the creature had had a real head it could have wrecked a dozen such
things with it without getting a scratch. _Hurry! Those may come at any
moment who will destroy all of us without palaver._

_I am trying, sir, but I cannot get through to him direct. It will
take a few moments_, the strange telepathist replied. She began to
wave rhythmically her peculiar arms, hands, and fingers. Others of the
outlanders brandished their members and made repulsive motions with
their ridiculous mouths. Finally--

_He says that he would rather not_, the interpreter reported. _He asks
you to go ahead. He will follow you down._

_Impossible--we cannot land upon this world or upon its primary, Dhil_,
Darjeeb argued, reasonably. _These people are enemies--savages--I have
just escaped from them. It is death to attempt to land anywhere in this
system except upon my home planet Uhal--that bluish one._

_Very well, then, we'll see you over there. We are just about out of
air, but it will take only a minute or so to reach Uhal._

But that would not do either, of course. Argument took too much time.
He would have to use force, and he had better call up reenforcements.
Darjeeb hurled mental orders to a henchman far below, threw out his
magnetic grapples, and turned on a broad, low-powered beam.

_Open up or die!_ he ordered. _I do not want to blast you open--but
time presses, and I will do so if I must!_

That treatment was effective, as the Uhalian had been pretty certain
that it would be. Pure heat is hard to take. The outer portal opened
and Darjeeb, after donning his armor and checking his ray-gun, picked
Luda up and swung nonchalantly out into space. Luda was tough enough
so that a little vacuum wouldn't hurt her--much. Inside the lifeboat
he tossed his trussed-up captive into an unoccupied corner and strode
purposefully toward the control board.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two main characters, Darjeeb and the strange telepathist. Darjeeb is trying to take over the strange vessel in order to gain control of the solar system, while the telepathist is trying to resist him. The scene also establishes the setting and the stakes of the conflict.
