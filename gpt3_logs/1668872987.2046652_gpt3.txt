SCENE:
XXIII.

ANOTHER INTRIGUE.


With all the apparent amount of suffering which we have attempted
to describe above, Manton was no little astonished, not only at the
promptness and completeness of the recovery of the woman Marie, but at
the shortness of the time which she permitted to elapse before he found
her again engaged deep in a bold and characteristic intrigue.

He had immediately determined that Elna should be separated from him
until the time of the proposed marriage had approached. While she was
to be sent to New England to prosecute her studies under the charge of
an artist friend, he himself proposed to spend the greater part of the
year in the northern mountains, hunting, fishing and exploring.

But before this prudent and proper step could be taken, a week or so
of preparation became necessary. It was only a week since the woman
had risen from her bed, a showery Niobe, as we have seen, when Manton
entered the house one morning at an hour when he was not expected,
he met the woman gliding hastily through a passage, with one of the
sleeves of her dress gone. The meaning of this sign at once flashed
across him, for he remembered to have seen that fair and beautiful
arm, by skilful accident, exposed to his own gaze during her first
attempts at diverting and exciting his passions, and he shrewdly
conceived that there must be some new victim on hand, even already.

Ha! said he maliciously, as she was hurrying past. Why, whats
become of your sleeve this morning?

The woman flushed very red, and her eye turned obliquely upon him as
she muttered confusedly

IIve lost it!

Ah, well, come! Let us look for it! Let us find it! The morning is too
cold! I will help you! I fear you will suffer!

No, no, never mind! I will find it myself!

But I insist! We must find it at once, before you take cold! Come, we
will look in the parlor! And he made a movement of his outstretched
hand as if to open the door.

She clutched him nervously, saying in a low whisper

Dont go in there, I have a visitor!

But as Manton only smiled at this and showed no disposition to desist,
she continued in an imploring voice

Dont go in! Mr. Narcissus, the editor, is there! I will get the
sleeve and put it on immediately! Dont disturb us now; I am just
reading to him the MS. of my new novel, which I hope he will undertake
to publish in his paper!

Well, said Manton, quietly stepping back, it must be confessed you
are prompt in finding alternatives! I wish you success in your new
publishing enterprise! And I suppose this bare arm is to have nothing
to do with his anticipated commentary upon your text!

Manton turned away with a light laugh, but the look which was sent
after him would have chilled his very soul could he have met it. His
sneering conjecture was only too true. She had already fastened upon
a new victim. But for once it turned out that it was file cut file.
She had at last met her equal in all that was detestableher peer in
baseness, and only an under-graduate to _her_ in cunning.

She had selected him as she did all her victims, with reference to
social and pecuniary position. He was at the time a co-editor and
ostensible part-owner of one of the most brilliant and successful
weekly papers of New York. She had always aspired to command
an organ. And anything in that line, from a review down to a
thumb-paper, to her restless ambition, was better than nothing. For by
a process more hideous to the world than anomalous in fact, she had
come to reconcile any degree of private intrigue, by balancing it with
the value of abstract teachings for the public good, under that liberal
postulate of the school to which she belonged, that the end justifies
the means.

In setting herself down for a regular siege before this newspaper
establishment, she had first in her eye, all three of the associate
owners. It was a matter of entire indifference to her, through which
she succeeded in obtaining an entrance to its columns, which might
lead to her control of the future tone of the paper. She opened the
investment in the usual form; first, by visiting them alone, in
their offices; then by bombarding them, from the distance of her own
writing-table, with a constant hail of those snow-white missives, with
the sugared contents of which we have before been made acquainted.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is light and mocking. The tone is one of amusement, and the point of view is that of an omniscient narrator.
