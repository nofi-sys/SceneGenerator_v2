Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Sylvia Shapleigh appeared to him more and more captivating, and he
realised after a while that he was as much in love with her as he
could be with any woman. But a great many things would have to be
settled before he could speak to Sylvia. He reflected that no man could
guarantee to himself one single day of life, and, on the whole, it was
better to have matters arranged in his lifetime. Then it occurred
to him for the first time that if he could satisfy the Blairs that
Lewis put an embargo upon their suppositious claims, there would be no
occasion for making it public. Of course, it would have to be known
to a certain number of persons, but they were chiefly legal people in
England, and England was in those days almost as far off as another
planet. And it must come out at his death, but that might be many
years off, and Lewis might have married into a good family, and the
gossip might have become an old story, and everything much better than
springing it suddenly on the community then. Skelton went quietly to
work, though, and accumulated the proofs of Lewiss parentage, and
found them much more conclusive than Bulstrode had thought them to be.
He was meanwhile gradually making up his mind to ask Sylvia Shapleigh
to marry him. Of course he must tell her all about Lewis, but he
thought it likely that she knew as much as he could tell her, and if
she really cared for him she would be good to the boy for his sake--to
say nothing of Lewiss sake, for he was undoubtedly lovable. It was
very unfortunate; he did not know of any man who had a complication so
painful; but still there were ways out of it. One thing was certain:
no one would ever trouble him with remarks on the subject, or Sylvia
either, if they should be married. People might think as they pleased,
but he and Sylvia and Lewis could afford to ignore gossip and idle
tittle-tattle.

Lewis, although obviously depressed, took a suddenly industrious turn
about his lessons. He began to study so hard, that Bulstrode was amazed
and delighted.

Why, he cried one day, you are learning so fast that youll soon be
as big a knowledge box as the British Museum.

I think Id better work hard, sir, because some day I shall probably
have to earn my living, answered Lewis quite gravely.

Pooh! said Bulstrode, youll have the greatest fortune that ever
was.

Lewis turned perfectly crimson, and said nothing. Presently Bulstrode
continued:

It seems to me, youngster, that you have been going through with a
change lately.

I have, sir, answered Lewis in a low voice. Mr. Skelton tells me
that if I will acknowledge that--that--I am not Thomas Pryors son he
will give me a fortune.

Showed you all the kingdoms of the earth to tempt you, eh?

Yes, sir, something like it.

And you dont want em?

Not at the price I have to pay for them, sir.

But I dont believe Skelton can help himself, or you either, from your
having that fortune. I think he wants to marry Miss Sylvia Shapleigh;
and if he dies, or marries, his wifes money either goes to you or to
the Blairs; and I believe the poor dead woman would turn over in her
grave if she thought anybody that Skelton hates like the Blairs would
get it.

But wouldnt she hate for me to get it? asked Lewis.

Well--here Bulstrode began to rub his shaggy head--not so much as
the Blairs. You see, you are innocent yourself; nobody would feel any
grudge against you; it all happened before Skelton married her; and
Mrs. Skelton was so desperately fond of Skelton, that she would be very
likely to be tolerant towards any innocent creetur that he loved.
Queer subjects women are.

If Mr. Skelton thinks I am going to give up without a fight, hes very
much mistaken! cried Lewis suddenly.

Bulstrode clapped him on the back and roared out, Good for you, boy!

Some days after that Skelton sent for Lewis into the library. Lewis
went with a beating heart. There had not been the slightest change in
their relations since that morning in the library, but it had been
wholly Lewiss own doing. He maintained a reserve towards Skelton
that was unbroken. Much as he loved the boy, Skelton could not bring
himself to become a supplicant, as it were, for his affections; and so,
although each watched the other, and they lived under the same roof,
there was a grim reserve between them.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Skelton is in love with Sylvia Shapleigh, and he realizes that he needs to tell her about Lewis in order to marry her. He also realizes that if he can convince the Blairs that Lewis is not their son, he can keep the whole matter private. He works hard to accumulate proof of Lewis's parentage, and he also begins to make plans to ask Sylvia to marry him. Meanwhile, Lewis takes a sudden interest in his studies. Skelton eventually calls him into the library and tells him that he is going to fight for him.
