SCENE:
XII.

SPIRITUAL CONFIDENCES.

And under fair pretence of friendly ends,
And well-placed words of glozing courtesy,
Baited with reasons not unplausible,
Wind me into easy-hearted man,
And hug him into snares.
MASK OF COMUS.


We shall follow the bedraggled heroine of the last chapter, begging
leave of the reader to see her home.

Mark with what an elate and vigorous step she trips it up Barclay
Street into Broadway, after taking leave of Manton at the door of the
Graham House. One would think that she should surely be tired, after
that tremendous mornings work, trudging and splashing through the
dirtiest mire of three-fourths of the great city. But noshe springs in
her gait, and her strange, animal eye, glitters fairly with a devilish
obliquity, which has for the moment usurped its expression. She does
not mind that people turn and stare after her dragging and bespattered
skirtsnot she!her very soul is possessed with the pre-occupation of
an ecstatic gloating over some great conquest achieved, or closely
perceived already in the prospective future into which she glares.

We shall see what we shall seeonly follow, still follow. She has
turned up Broadway, and threads the great throng there with rapid
glide, as street after street is passed. Ah, now we have it! She
crossesthis is Eighth Street! There, in Broadway, near the corner,
stands a great house, with wide-open door; the smeared and dirty
lintels, the greasy latch, the wide, uncarpeted hall of which, at
once reveals it to be one of those miscellaneous and incomprehensible
edifices, which are not unfrequently met with on the great
thoroughfare, and the uses of which are not generally more specifically
known, than that they are fashionable boarding-houses.

Into this ever-gaping entrance she wheeled, and darted up the broad,
uncarpeted stairway, which she continued to ascend with almost
incredible ease and swiftness to the fifth story. When near the end
of a long and narrow passage, she paused before one of the doors, and
tapping it slightly, entered without farther ceremony.

A handsome and well-dressed woman, who was engaged in writing at a
small escritoire, looked up indifferently as she entered, but the
moment she caught the expression of the newcomers face, she sprang
to her feet, throwing down the pen, and with a strangely shrill and
unmusical laugh, screamed out in a most inconceivably voluble style

Why, I declare! Marie, whats the matter? Your eyes are almost
bursting out of your head! You look as if you had found a bag of gold,
and meant to give me half! Why, bless the woman, how she looks! Have
you caught him at last? Well, were in luck! Ive caught my man for
sure! Hes been here all the morning, hes just left! Why, how the
woman looks! She keeps staring so! You havent gone crazy for joy, have
you? Now, do tell! how have you managed to catch that insolent baby,
you seemed to have set your heart on so? Why, how muddy the woman is!
she shrieked, looking down at the condition of her dress. Ha! ha! ha!
ha! Do tell, what sort of a game have you been playing? Did you have to
hunt him through a pig-sty?

The woman had been standing motionless, in the meantime, with distended
eyes and compressed mouth, stretched in a rigid smile of supernaturally
savage exultation. She gazed towards the face of the speaker, but
did not seem to listen to her, or see her features. She looked the
abstracted embodiment of triumphing evil. Very soon her stiffened lips
quivered slightly, while the voluble lady stepping forward, shook her
sharply by the shoulder, shrilling out again

Do look at the woman! Why, what can be the matter? Cant you talk? The
cats got the womans tongue surely! I did not think you were so much
in earnest about that green boy! Why, I could twist him about my finger
like a tow-string! I have achieved something in conquering _my_ man!

Y-your man! said the woman slowly, interrupting her. But these words
were accompanied by a look of such strange and taunting significance,
that the other turned instantly pale and sprang back, as if she had
received an electric shock from those singular eyes, that fell upon her
for a moment with their evil obliquity, and then returned instantly to
their natural expression. Wh-why, what do you mean? stammered the
other angrily.

The woman only answered with a pleasant smileNow dont be a jealous
fool, Jeannette ShrewellI shall never interfere with your schemes if
you dont with mine.

Yes! but because you knew Edmond long ago, continued the other in a
fierce and shrewish voice, you dare to insinuate to me that he too has
passed through your hands!


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with the heroine, who has just been through a tough morning, walking with a spring in her step and a gleam in her eye. She is headed to a large, fashionable boarding house and, upon entering, is immediately accosted by another woman. This woman, after taking in the state of the heroine's clothing, starts to interrogate her about how she managed to "catch" her man. The heroine is nonplussed by the woman's questions and seems lost in her own thoughts. The other woman, growing impatient, demands to know what is going on. The heroine then comes out of her reverie and, with a smile, tells the other woman that she has "caught her man" and that she need not worry about him anymore.
