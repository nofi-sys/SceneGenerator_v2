Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Lilian Braithwaite came of a handsome race. Tall, with a well-molded
figure, gray eyes, brown hair, and complexion rich enough in its
tints to promise something more lovely still when a season or two in
town should have toned down its coloring, she gave promise of beauty
distinguished enough to hold its own amongst the fairest women she
might meet. The plain white cashmere which looked so simple on Betty
Mainwaring had quite a different effect upon her handsome figure, and
the tulle headdress, half cap, half veil, which she wore in common with
the other candidates of her own class, had as much of the veil and as
little of the cap about it as possible. Already, at seventeen, she
walked through the crowd of admiring faces with a bearing which showed
more of the dignity of an acknowledged beauty than of the modesty of a
young girl. She smiled at the young governess good-humoredly enough,
however, and would even have entered into a whispered conversation,
with scornfully critical remarks upon the rest of the candidates,
if Miss Lane had not received her overtures shyly and with all the
primness of her profession. Miss Braithwaite, who was not easily
repulsed, gave a little amused shrug of the shoulders, and said, in a
loud whisper:

Are you afraid the vicar is looking at you?

And then she met his rather uneasy glance in her own direction with a
bland smile.

It had been rather a difficult matter for him to bring himself to
believe that Miss Braithwaite was in all respects fit for confirmation;
but, as no scruple had ever entered her own head, and as, moreover, she
was technically prepared for the rite, being able to repeat the Lords
Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and the Catechism with perfect fluency,
he had no choice but to bring her to the bishop with the rest of the
candidates.

When the service was over, and she rejoined her mother and brother,
a young man with a rather handsome face, but deformed and resting
on crutches, came up to her and stood silently by while her brother
wrapped her again in the long, white mantle she had come in.

You here, Stephen! How did you come? The doctor said you were not to
go out until your cough was better, said Miss Braithwaite, in a voice
scarcely as low as it ought to have been.

I wanted to see you--all in white like a bride, making all the other
girls look ugly and clumsy, whispered the cripple, with his face
flushing; so I got Thompson to get the pony-carriage ready, and
followed you as fast as I could.

Stephen Lawlers contempt for the appearance of the rest of the
candidates was not shared by his cousin, Harry Braithwaite, who turned
to watch one of the girls admiringly, and whispered:

I say, Lilian, how awfully fetching little Miss Prim looks in that
get-up! Little Miss Prim was Annie Lane, the governess.

Yes, she is a pretty girl, answered his sister, who was handsome
enough to be able to afford to acknowledge beauty in others.

Meanwhile the crowd was surging toward the door, and Harry Braithwaite
kept his mother and sister as near the Vicarage party as he could. At
the church door they discovered that a heavy shower of rain was coming
down, and Mrs. Mainwaring was lamenting piteously that her husband, who
had come on the box of the brougham beside the coachman, would lose
his voice entirely if he were to return in the same way through the
rain. Harry Braithwaite whispered a few words into his mothers ear,
and, raising his hat, stepped forward and placed a seat in their own
carriage at the disposal of the vicars wife, in his mothers name.

If Miss Lane will come with us, there will be lots of room in the
brougham for you and your two daughters and the vicar too, said he.

And before Mrs. Mainwaring could say more than Oh, thank you, but, he
had severed Miss Lane from her pupils and was escorting her under an
umbrella to the big Braithwaite barouche.

Mrs. Mainwaring looked uneasy; her two daughters, Joan and Betty,
looked displeased.

I am sure papa will not approve of that arrangement, mamma, said
Joan, the eldest of the family, who had come to see her sister
confirmed.

Well, what could I do, Joan? He meant to be good-natured; and it would
not do for the wife of the vicar of the parish to show any prejudice.
Of course I should not have allowed you or Betty to go, but with Miss
Lane it is different; she can take care of herself.

I should think so! said Joan, sharply.

And then the vicar came up, and his wife hurried him into the brougham,
saying there was plenty of room; and it was not until they were on the
point of stating that she confessed, in answer to his inquiries, that
Miss Lane was going home in the Braithwaites carriage.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene takes place at a church, where a group of girls are being confirmed. Among them is Lilian Braithwaite, a beautiful 17-year-old. She is accompanied by her mother and brother, as well as by a young man named Stephen Lawler, who is deformed and uses crutches.
After the confirmation service, the crowd begins to disperse and Lilian's brother helps her put on her mantle. Stephen tells her that he wanted to see her in her white dress, and she scolds him for coming out despite his doctor's orders. Harry Braithwaite, Lilian's cousin, then admires another girl in the crowd, Annie Lane, the governess.
As the crowd begins to make their way to the door, it starts to rain heavily. Mrs. Mainwaring, the vicar's wife, is worried that her husband, who is outside in the carriage, will catch a cold. Harry Braithwaite offers to take her, Miss Lane, and the vicar in their own carriage to shelter them from the rain. Mrs. Mainwaring is hesitant at first, but decides to accept when Harry assures her that there is plenty of room.
Once they are in the carriage, Mrs. Mainwaring begins to worry that her husband will disapprove of her letting Miss Lane ride with them. However, Joan, her eldest daughter, points out that Miss Lane is a grown woman and can take care of herself. The vicar then arrives and they set off.
