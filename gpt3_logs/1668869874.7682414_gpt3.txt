SCENE:
Grabbing it by the collar and stooping low, in case I had to take
a new breath, I dragged it swiftly back through the door and up to
the companion, where the air was somewhat sweeter. I recognized the
captain, and as men were overhead on the poop, waiting for orders,
I had them haul him up, and lead the deck hose into the forward
companion. Then, to get there the more quickly, and thinking of Fred,
possibly suffocating in his room, I took another blind dash into the
forward cabin, and found sweeter air, also more light. And there was
Fred, who had opened the forward door for air, coolly playing the
stream from a fire extinguisher into the blazing storeroom.

"Never mind your hose," he said. "I'll have it out in a jiffy."

But the men were already crowding into the cabin with the hose; and,
directing me to go on deck and watch the ship, he ordered the men to
drag out on deck all half-consumed articles, as fast as they could
handle them. Angry and jealous that this young prig should have proved
himself the man of the hour, I obeyed him, and found the skipper and
the young lady aft near the wheel, both conscious, but weak. I reported
that the fire was out, thanks to the first mate and a fire extinguisher.

"Yes, it was in his room, ready for such an emergency," said the
captain. "Josie, this is the second mate, Mr. Winters; my niece, Mr.
Winters. She has been very seasick, so far, and has not shown herself.
Do you know, Mr. Winters, I have hopes of our first officer. He is
young, but efficient."

"Of course he is, sir," I answered hypocritically. "His education is a
valuable asset."

"Oh, but it was not his education, in this case. Why, he went down in
that stifling smoke, and rescued this little girl, just as she was
fainting away; then he went on into the forward cabin, and hauled me
out to safety. I honor that young man."

"Yes," said the girl. "I saw him, just as my senses were leaving me. He
seemed a demigod, so big, and broad-shouldered, and fearless. I knew I
was safe at that moment."

Before I could speak, Fred appeared, and I backed away. I knew that the
matter was too trifling of itself to make a point of--to assert that
I was the heroic individual that went down into the smoke; yet, when
I looked on and listened, while that apology for a seaman responded
politely to their thanks for saving their lives, I escaped the scene. I
went forward of the house, where I soon met the steward.

"Look here, you animated frankfurter," I said, as I collared him. "Did
you tell the skipper that the mate went down the after companion, and
pulled him out?"

"Sure," he answered earnestly. "You're a mate, ain'dt it?"

"Get out," I rejoined, pushing him from me. "If it wasn't for the
shame of it, I'd hit you. The 'mate' aboard ship is the first mate,
always--not the second, or the third."

"But I will tell him, all right, sir," he said.

"Don't trouble yourself," I responded angrily. "Let the matter drop.
The mate put the fire out, and that's all that's important."

So the matter dropped. It was my watch below from eight to twelve
that night, and I slept well, in spite of my anger and chagrin. It
was my watch on deck from twelve to four, and I stood it in the
tranquil poise of mind that usually comes to men after a sleep. I
forgave the poor, vain weakling, knowing that I was the stronger. But
in my watch below, from four to half-past seven in the morning, I
fought monsters and fled from the horrible _thing_, and awoke weak,
shaken, and nerveless. I had never tasted whiskey in my life, but in
my half-conscious condition there seemed to be the thought that I had
tasted it--a thought which merged into the mental query as to whether
it would not be better to stupefy myself, like drunkards, rather than
endure such torture when asleep and helpless. Then came full awakening,
and a return to my normal self.

As second mates eat at the second table, I went on deck and relieved
Fred. He seemed anxious to avoid direct conversation with me, and after
giving me the course and the happenings of the watch, hurried below.
When he came up, at eight bells, he was more friendly.

"Stunning fine girl," he said. "Just able to make a pretense at
breakfast, but she thinks I'm all right."

I mentally consigned him to the lower regions, and went to my
breakfast; but there was no sign of the young lady.

The wind died away that morning, and I made sail. For the first time
since sailing, the ship wore royals and skysails, sliding along with
a quartering breeze over a sea that was just a little too heavy for
seasick folk. Yet, about eleven, the girl came up, escorted by the
skipper. And as I looked at the pale, pure, clean-cut little face and
big, luminous eyes, I lost what philosophy my last nightmare had left
me. I knew that from that moment this girl was to be everything to me.
And I cursed the mock hero who had stolen my vantage. She went down
soon, and the wind seemed to blow colder.
