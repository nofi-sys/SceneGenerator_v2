SCENE:
She wandered into the kitchen and whipped together a salad for luncheon.
She knitted two rows on a sweater at which she was working, and flung it
aside to plunge into one of Chopins waltzes at the piano. But Ruth was
not in the mood for music. Restlessly she turned to a magazine, fingered
the pages aimlessly, read at a story for a paragraph or two, then with a
sudden decision tossed the periodical on the table and walked out of the
house to the garage. Yet a minute, and she was spinning down the road
toward Boviers Camp.

It was such a day in late summer as comes only to the Rockies. From a
blue sky, flecked with a few mackerel clouds, poured a bath of sunshine.
Her lungs drank in an air like wine, pure and strong. The sunny slopes
of the high peaks pushed up into the rare, untempered light of Wyoming.
The scent of the pines was in her nostrils. Once, when she stopped to
look at a doubtful tire, the murmurous voices of the desert whispered in
her ears. In spite of herself Ruths heart answered the call of the
distant, shining mountain to rejoice and be glad.

The car topped the rim of the saucer-shaped valley and swept down toward
the little village. What Ruth saw quickened her blood. Beyond the post
office a great huddle of sheep was being driven forward. At the head of
them rode a man with a rifle in one hand lying across the horn of the
saddle. On the porch of the store sat Larry Silcott and her husband
watching the man steadily. Neither of them carried any arms exposed to
view.

The young wife drove the car down the basin and stopped near the store,
leaving the engine still running. None of the men even glanced her way.
Their eyes were focused on each other with a tenseness that made her
want to scream. She waited, breathless, uncertain what to expect. The
pulse in her throat beat fast with excitement. That a collision of some
sort impended she did not need to be told.

The man with the rifle spoke thickly in a heavy, raucous voice: Ive
been looking for you, Rowan McCoy. First off, Ill tell you something.
Im here with my sheep like I promised, on the way to Circle Diamond.
Im going right past the door of the ranch to Thunder Mountain. If any
man tries to stop me, Ill fix his clock. Get that?

Rowans eyes were like chilled steel, his body absolutely motionless.
Better turn back while you can, Tait, he advised quietly.

Ill see you in hell first. Im going through. But theres another
thing Ive got to settle with you, Rowan McCoy. Thats about my wife.
Stand up and fight, you white-livered coyote! A sudden passionate venom
leaped into the voice of the sheepman. He cursed his enemy savagely and
flung at him a string of vile names.

Ruth, terror-stricken, believed the man was working himself up to do
murder. She wanted to cry out, to rush forward and beg him to stop. But
her throat was parched and her limbs weighted with heavy chains.

Your wife left you because you are a bully and a drunkard. I had
nothing to do with her going, retorted McCoy.

Youre a liara rotten liar! You got her to run away with you. You
took her in your car to Wagon Wheel. You gave her money to buy a ticket.
You were seen on the train with her. I swore Id kill you on sight, and
Im going to do it. Get out of the way, Silcott!

The energy flowed back into Ruths limbs. She threw in the clutch and
drove forward furiously. There was the sound of a shot, then of another.
Next moment she was pushing home the brake and shutting off the gas. The
car slammed to a halt, its wheels hard against the porch. She had driven
directly between the sheepman and his intended victim.

Out of the haze that for a moment enveloped Ruths senses boomed a
savage, excited voice:

Turn me loose, Mac! Lemme go! Ill finish the damned sheepman while Im
on the job.

The scene opened before her eyes like a moving-picture film. On the
porch her husband was struggling with a man for the possession of a gun,
while young Silcott was sagging against a corner pillar, one hand
clutched to his bleeding shoulder. Thirty yards away Tait lay on the
ground, face down, beside his horse. From the corral, from the store,
from the adjoining doctors office men poured upon the scene.

The place was suddenly alive with gesticulating people.

Rowan tore the rifle from the man with whom he was wrestling. Dont be
a fool, Falkner. Youve done enough already. I shouldnt wonder if Tait
had got his.

He had it coming to him, if ever a man had. If Id been two seconds
later youd have been a goner, Mac. I just beat him to it. Good riddance
if he croaks, I say.

McCoy caught sight of Ruth. He moved toward her, his eyes alive with
surprise and dismay.
