Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
A sound, a very slight sound, made him raise his head. There was no one
in sight. He had the earth, as I have told you, to himself. Only the
wind whispered among the heather and grass, and rustled softly through
the gorse bushes.

John went down on his knees and raised the flat stone. Sheer idle
curiosity prompted the action. He hadnt the faintest expectation of
seeing anything beneath. He peered within; and then gave vent to a
tiny chuckle of amazed surprise. He put his hand within the circle
of stones, and drew forth three objects,--firstly, a piece of green
ribbon; secondly, a small, a very small, thimble; and thirdly, a rosary
of red beads.

Oh, ho! quoth he to himself, if fairies have been at work here, they
are Catholic fairies, it would seem.

He fitted the thimble on the top of his little finger, where it sat in
an insecure and ludicrous position.

A _cache_, said John, but whose?

He looked before him down the sloping moorland. And now, far off, he
descried a small black speck. The black speck was a figure. It was
coming towards him.

Theres just the faintest conceivable chance, said John.

He removed the thimble from its ridiculous position. He put it, the
ribbon, and the rosary once more within their hiding-place, replaced
the flat stone, and withdrew himself to a post of vantage, couched
behind a gorse bush. Therefrom he awaited possible developments.

As the black speck drew nearer, it defined itself as a girl child, some
eleven years old or thereabouts. A gypsy-looking elf she was. Coming
nearer still, he saw that she was dark-haired, smutty-eyed. Her head
was uncovered; she was clad in a faded green frock; her brown legs were
bare, her feet cased in old shoes. She was walking quickly; eagerness,
expectation, were in her bearing. To Johns mind the possibility
already resolved itself into something akin to certainty. The next
moment he saw that his surmise had been correct.

She came straight across the heather to the small circle of stones, and
went down on her knees beside it. The flat stone was pushed aside; the
small brown hand dived within the circle.

Ah!

John heard the little gasp of pleasure.

She came to a sitting posture, the treasures gathered on to her lap.
John saw her face plainly. The ribbon and thimble were examined with
sheer and palpable delight. The rosary was handled gravely; there was
the tiniest hint of question in the handling. Then suddenly she lifted
it to her lips. The next moment she was on her knees again, telling the
beads devoutly.

If, quoth John to himself, I am not much mistaken, tis that young
limb of mischief, Molly Biddulph.

And there she knelt in the sunshine, among the heather, looking, for
all the world, a young, rapt devotee of prayer, the scarlet beads
falling through her small brown fingers. Her eyes were closed; her
lips moved rapidly. Here was matter for a poets pen; a subject for an
artists brush. The soft wind stirred the dark hair on her forehead,
the sun kissed her bronzed cheeks. A butterfly flitted to her shoulder,
lighted a moment, circled round her head, and flew away.

Coming to an end of her orisons, she made a great Sign of the Cross,
got to her feet, and sped away down the hill, clutching her treasures
tightly.

John came from behind the gorse bush.

Well! said he aloud.

It might be called a pretty little scene, said a voice behind him.

Turning, amazed, he met a pair of laughing eyes, saw a white-robed
figure, and two attendant knights.

You! quoth John.

She laughed.

We were afraid, so dreadfully afraid, lest you should decamp with the
treasures, said she. I had the greatest difficulty in restraining
these two from rushing to the rescue.

I _thought_ I heard a sound! ejaculated John.
