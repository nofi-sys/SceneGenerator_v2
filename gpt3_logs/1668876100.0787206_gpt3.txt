Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
How should I know? asked Fay.

Well, it was! It was made by the Seabold people of Hartford. Guaranteed
fire-proof and burglar-proof and non-pickable. It didnt burn up, but
everything else happened to it.

Fay smiled openly. He liked Sir Richard better for the remark. He grew
more at ease as he waited. Well, he suggested, Im here with you, and
youve got something for me to do. I can guess that much. Does it
concern a Seabold safe?

It most certainly does!

Fay stared at the three boxes. He furrowed his brow. They were not part
of any American safe he had ever known. They were more like the
tin-cases which middle-aged drabs carried about the Law Courts or the
Brokerage Houses. Their locks could have been opened with a hair-pin.

Youll have to explain, chief.

Sir Richard swung open his coat and drew from the inner pocket a small
notebook. He thumbed the pages and paused at one. Seabold Safe
Corporation, Limited, he said. They placed a number of their
strong-boxes in England and the Continent. Their salespeople were very
enterprising. We have a record, from their own files, of seven. Four of
the seven were smaller than the one in Hatton Gardens. The lock, or
whatever it is called, was different.

Sir Richard glanced up and then buried his nose between the pages of the
notebook.

Two of the larger, he said musingly, were installed in Paris. Theyre
there yet. The one that interests us is in the countrynorth and east of
here. It is the same size and general dimensions as the unfortunate one
you opened in Hatton Gardens. I understand the situation is
similarparallel. It would be ridiculously easy for a man of your talent
to go to this country, north and east of here, and open that
strong-boxwithout trace.

Sir Richard snapped the book shut and glanced up at Fay.

The cracksman slightly moistened his lips. The cat was out of the bag!
The reason for MacKeenons visit to Dartmoorthe release when five years
were yet to be servedthe sudden interest of Sir Richard Colstrom, were
all explained. England, who had severely punished him, now wanted a
favor done.

The two men exchanged a glance of mutual understanding. Fays mind
worked swiftly. He went over the details of his arrest. He recalled the
method he had used in opening the great safe in Hatton Gardens. No other
man could have done it, save by bungling.

Suppose, he said, feeling surer of his ground. Suppose, Sir Richard,
we will say that I can go to Holland and open that boxwithout trace.
What would there be in it for me?

Ah, were getting on!

Im not so sure that we are getting anywhere, for what would happen to
me if I were lagged in Holland? Suppose somebody tipped me off? What
then?

You and I alone know what you are going to do.

MacKeenon?

He obeys orders. I like you, Fay. Damnit, I admire enterpriseeven if
it is opening strong-boxes! What would Scotland Yard be if there werent
men like you in the world? Youre a mark and all that, but youve done
one or two big things in your line.

Fay rubbed his wrists as if handcuffs were still binding him. He shifted
his weight and eyed the three boxes with new concern. My price, he
said, may be more than you or England are willing to pay.

No price is too high to pay for the key to this cipher. Sir Richard
jerked a thumb toward the black boxes. The secret for making these dyes
will save the world from a galling monopoly. It will make the place we
live in, Fay, just that much safer for Democracy. The war between
nations is over. There will come another warthe commercial one between
Germany and the world. We can best win that war by being preparedby
dye-works and potash deposits and freedom from secret formulae.

Fay nodded at this statement. My countryAmericais interested in
this? he asked.

Yes and no! Your country shares with England in every discovery. This
set of boxes which contain the cipher were obtained in Switzerland at a
high cost. Three of our men were waylaid and killed. Two more were
trapped in a Berne hotel and had to fight their way out. The German
chemist who offered the dye secretsat a priceis dead by poison. We got
the boxes through. They contain the full details of manufacturing
thirty-six of the principal dyes. They are in a baffling cipher which
has held us up.
