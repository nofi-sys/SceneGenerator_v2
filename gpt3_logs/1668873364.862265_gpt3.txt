Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
The smoke has become quite dense by this time, and as she looks out
across the river she sees leaping spires of orange-colored flames amidst
the lifting, rolling clouds of smoke.

Ah, baby Lucy, we are fortunate not to be over there, she says, and
clasps the little one more closely while she croons a lullaby.

Suddenly she is attracted by the strange actions of the family cat,
which has been stretched out upon a rug across the room. Puss darts
across the floor to the window, and placing her forepaws upon the
window-seat, looks out. Then with a look of terror she runs to Lissa,
and crouching at her feet begins to mew piteously.

What is it, Menkin? asks Lissa, putting down her hand to stroke the
creatures back. The cat darts again to the window, and Lissa, following
her, sees that which blanches her face and lips to chalky whiteness.

The fire has crossed the river! The wind has carried the burning cinders
even to the nearer bank, and now, only three-quarters of a mile away,
she can see the curling smoke, and tongues of red fire lapping the dry
grass.

Frantic with alarm, her thoughts work rapidly. She drops her baby into
the basket and rushes out to the well, which, with its buckets, stands
near the house.

Heavens! How long it seems ere, working desperately, hand over hand upon
the rope, she can bring the filled bucket to the top of the curb. Then
with a pail of water and a gunny-sack she flies across the fields to
meet the oncoming fire. With supernatural strength, evolved from her
terror, with the wet sacking she beats back the ravening flames madly,
frantically, and with all the force of over-strained muscles and
fear-nerved energy she fights the merciless element, until at last,
blinded by smoke, and scorched and blackened, she turns toward the
house, and flies with all the strength left her, her only hope now to
get her baby and run with it to the only haven of safety, the black soil
of the plowed land.

Snatching her child from its pillow and folding it in her smoke-begrimed
arms she dashes again through the doorway and runs on and on over the
soft earth, until, with many yards of the moist, upturned sod about her,
she pauses and turns her eyes backward toward her humble yet beloved
home.

With fascinated gaze she watches the flames creep nearer and nearer, now
only like red snakes in the grass, then as the tall weeds catch, like
sheets of scarlet, wound and twisted in smoke-clouds.

The fire has parted at the place where her frenzied efforts have been
most effective, and one part is sweeping down the side of the road
opposite the house, the other around the barn-yard toward the stables.
She can see the horses corralled beyond the barn, and anticipating their
fate she hides her face in her childs clothing and sobs.

She is startled by hearing the sound of galloping horses and looks out
to see a drove of frightened animals come madly down the road ahead of
the flames. Will their instincts guide them toward a place of safety? A
burning stack across the road is adding to the blinding smoke, and she
can see through smarting eyes but a short distance around her.

O God! spare the poor creatures tied there and helpless, she prays.
Oh, why didnt I think to loose them?

She crouches down over her child and gives away to her grief. Suddenly
she hears steps near her, and glancing up, the pink nose of Puss, her
pony, is thrust into her hand.

O you dear creature, how did you get away? she falters. Then as she
perceives the dragging rope, yet fastened to the up-pulled stake, she
knows what Puss in her fright has been able to accomplish.

We all have superhuman strength given us in our time of need, she
murmurs. She strains her eyes for a glimpse of the burning house, but
the smoke is so painful she is fain to hide her face, while her faithful
horse rubs its head against her as if to assure her of sympathy.

Lissa! cries an anxious voice near her.

O Nate! Oh, our poor horses and our home! What shall we do?

I am thankful _you_ are safe, Lissa. I feared you might not remember to
come here soon enough. Keep your eyes covered and crouch down close to
the ground. This smoke from that burning stack is overpowering.

And our burning house and barns! O Nate, wails Lissa, those poor,
poor horses! She bows her head again, and for some moments neither
speak.

Lissa, Lissa, look up! cries Nathan suddenly, his voice thrilling with
a note of exultation. Our home is safe! Do you hear? Safe!
