SCENE:
XII.

On Board the Schooner.


Fotheringay, in his kindly way, conveyed the captains orders to Hoppy
and strongly advised the Cape Codder to make the best of a difficult
situation.

I feel sure, Captain Mayo, that your patriotism urges you to refuse
Captain Raggetts ultimatum; but, after all, you are not asked to take
arms against your compatriots. My interpretation of your orders is that
your duty will be to assist Dunton in keeping the schooner clear of the
shoals during the surveying cruise.

Im not any too well read in the law, lieutenant, but I can plainly
see that my assistance to the enemy in war time looks pretty much like
treason to my country. I have heard Uncle Jabez Rich tell the story of
Benedict Arnold too often not to know something of a traitors fate.
All the same, lieutenant, tis very kind of you to try and make it easy
for me.

Captain Raggett is determined to have his way in this matter, Captain
Mayo, and it pains me to think of your position should you refuse
to carry out his orders. I have heard some stories of the fearful
punishments suffered by recalcitrant American prisoners and I know
Barclay of the Grampus does not mince matters when dealing with such
unfortunates.

Aye, said Hoppy, I know the poor devils are badly treated. Dunton
seems to know that we are to be shipmates; he passed me a short time
ago and there was a triumphant leer on his countenance. I shouldnt
call him a handsome man at the best of times, but the look he favored
me with would become the devil himself!

Yes, Captain Mayo, Dunton has got orders to be ready for the cruise. I
regret that you should be under his command, but I trust you will see
the uselessness of running foul of him.

Oh, you can trust me for that, lieutenant. I shall make it a point to
steer clear of him as much as I can. Anyway, as the schooner will have
a crew of twenty it looks like a poor chance for me in case of trouble!

The crew will treat you all right. They are all good men and
especially detailed for this business on account of their good
characters. Like all man-o-wars men they like their frolic and their
grog, but Dunton is not very popular and he is sure to limit the strong
waters.

Then his popularity wont increase, Mr. Fotheringay. When do we start?

The frigate sails tomorrow for a practice cruise in Massachusetts bay
and it is probable that the schooner will leave at the same time.

All right, Mr. Fotheringay; you can tell Captain Raggett that I shall
do my best to help Dunton in the survey. Between us we should be able
to find out the dangerous places, and they are many. I wonder what Win
Knowles thinks of all this!

Captain Knowles will be very busy getting that ransom money, replied
the lieutenant smilingly.

Hell be in a devil of a state of mind when he finds that he cant get
back to the frigate! However, I gave him a broad hint that his journey
would do me no good, but Win was always one of those fellows that you
cant convince when hes made up his mind that his own ideas are the
best.

Fotheringay reported Hoppys decision to the commander and the latter
expressed his satisfaction at the Cape Codders acquiescence in the
project. Next morning, the frigate passed out of Provincetown harbor
and headed for the northwest. Soon after, the schooners anchor was
weighed and the memorable cruise began.

It was a lovely morning. Before the gentle breeze the schooner
took her leisurely way across Cape Cod bay and in the direction
of Barnstable. As he stood on her deck, Hoppy Mayo was a prey to
conflicting thoughts. He little dreamed that at the finish of the
adventure in which he was an unwilling participant he should occupy a
niche in the temple of fame, or that his name should be handed down
through the years as that of a man who had not hesitated in the face of
fearful odds to match his strategy against the foes of his country and
win undying renown by an act of individual daring which has rarely been
equaled in our naval annals. No such thought crossed his mind; but, on
the contrary, he felt already the opprobrium which would be his lot
when history should record the fact that he had aided the enemies of
the fatherland. True, he had not abandoned all hope; his keen mind had
been at work and he had reasoned it out that there was still a chance
left. This chance was a remote one, but stranger things had occurred
and fortune might yet favor him.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Hoppy Mayo agrees to help the British survey the Massachusetts coastline, despite knowing that it is considered treasonous. He hopes to find a way to help the Americans win the war. His plan is risky, but he is determined to try.
