What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
The little scamp has circumvented me, I see, he remarked, and did not
seem displeased at the idea.

Lewis soon sidled up to Sylvia, proud and delighted at her notice. But
it was all the notice he had, except from Mr. Conyers, who patted him
on the head, and a smile from Mrs. Blair. The clergyman had come in
response to a personal note as well as a card from Skelton, and walked
about sadly, thinking on the vast and sorrowful spectacle of human
nature even in the presence of so much fleeting joy. He had not been
in the house an hour, though, before he came up to say good-night.
There was not only much card playing going on in the library, but
considerable betting, which was the fashion in those days, and to that
Conyers was unalterably opposed.

Mr. Skelton, said he, coming up to him, I must say good-night.

Why so early? asked Skelton graciously. Since you have done me the
honour of coming, why not do me the pleasure of staying?

Because, said Conyers, who spoke the truth in season and out of
season, it is against my conscience to stay where betting is going
on. Forgive me, if I apparently commit a breach of hospitality, but
consider, Mr. Skelton, you will one day be held accountable for the
iniquity that is now taking place under your roof.

I accept the responsibility, answered Skelton, with unabated
politeness, and I regret your decision. You are always welcome at
Deerchase, Mr. Conyers, and you have the most perfect liberty of
expressing your opinions.

Thank you, replied poor Conyers, with tears in his eyes. If
everybody was as tolerant as you, my ministry would be easier than it
is.

As Conyers went one way, Skelton went off another, thinking to himself,
Was ever a man so openly defied as I? True it was he could be openly
defied, and everybody had full liberty, until Skeltons own orbit was
crossed: then there was no liberty.

Old Tom Shapleigh swung, like a pendulum, between cards and dancing. He
danced with all the vigor of colonial days, and his small, high-bred
feet, cased in white-silk stockings and low shoes, with silver buckles,
twinkled like a ballet dancers as he cut the pigeon wing. Mrs. Blair,
who danced sedately and gracefully, was his partner. Bob Skinny, his
head thrown back and wearing an expression of ecstatic delight, watched
the dancers from a corner, occasionally waving his fluke to mark the
time. However, by some occult means he had become acquainted with the
champagne punch, and when Skeltons back was turned, Bob proceeded to
cut the pigeon wing too, and to back-step and double-shuffle with the
most surprising agility. In the midst of this performance, though, a
hint of Skeltons approach being given, Bob instantly assumed the most
rigid and dignified pose imaginable.

Lewis, after dancing once with Sylvia and once with Mrs. Blair, who
spoke to him kindly, wandered about, lonely enough. The people did not
relax in the least their aloofness towards him. He felt inexpressibly
sad and forlorn, and at this ball, too, which, as a matter of fact,
might never have been given but for him. But the beauty and splendour
of the scene dazzled him. He could not tear himself away.

Something of the same spell was upon Bulstrode. He knew little and
cared less for social life; he was one of those unfortunates who have
but one single, solitary source of enjoyment--the purely intellectual;
but the lights, the music, the gaiety, the festal air, had its
effect even on his sluggish temperament. He sat in a corner of the
drawing-room, his bulky, awkward figure filling up a great chair, and
Lewis came and leaned silently upon the back of it. In some way, master
and pupil felt strange to the rest of the world that night, and drawn
together.

Mr. Bulstrode, said Lewis presently, I always feel alone in a crowd.
Dont you?

Yes, boy, answered Bulstrode, glancing about him with an odd look of
dejection. And in a crowd of merry-makers my old heart grows chill
with loneliness.

It is much worse to be lonely when you are young, Lewis moralised.
But there is Miss Sylvia Shapleigh. I wonder if she will come up and
talk to us?

Sylvia did come up and speak to them. There was a new brilliancy in her
smile, and a deep and eloquent flush upon her cheek. Bulstrode felt
compelled to pay her one of his awkward compliments.

My dear young lady, he said, to-night you look like one of those
fair Greek girls of old, who lived but to smile and to dance and to
love.

Sylvias colour deepened; she stood quite still, gazing at Bulstrode as
if he had uttered a prophecy; but then Lewis, suddenly seeing people
going out of the bay windows on the lawn, cried out excitedly: Now the
finest part of the fireworks is going off! Come along! And, seizing
her hand, they went out on the smooth-shaven lawn as far as the river.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the relationship between Lewis and Mr. Bulstrode, and to show how they are both feeling out of place at the party. The author also uses this opportunity to describe the setting and the atmosphere of the party.
