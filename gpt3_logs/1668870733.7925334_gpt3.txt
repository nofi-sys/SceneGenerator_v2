Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
The men are all in the kitchen, said Mary to the young man, and I
suppose you will want to go there, too.

Arrah, then, Mary, spoke his mother who sat among the group of women,
its himself that ud stay here till the cows come home iv Annie
Clancy were ony here.

A titter ran about and Goose looked embarrassed. Dont mind her, said
he.

Annies a nice girl, said Mary, smiling at him with her kind eyes.

Do Goose still droive the milk wagon, Mrs. McGonagle? asked Mrs.
Burns after the young man had gone into the kitchen.

He do that same, proudly, an arns a good profit ivery wake.

The street door had opened and voices were heard in the entry.

It sounds like the OHaras, said Mrs. McGlory, wife of the
contractor, who sat in a corner fanning herself, with all the dignity
of her social position. Mrs. Burns elevated her hands in dismay.

Theyll be keenin, jewel! she cried to Mary.

I wouldnt have it! declared Mrs. Clancy, the grocers wife. Whatll
people tink?

The OHara sisters came bobbing into the room in queer-looking
quilted bonnets that hid their faces, and triangularly folded shawls
pulled tightly about their narrow shoulders. Espying Mary, they threw
themselves upon her with lamentations.

Mary, darlin, cried Bridget, its a heart full av trouble yez have
this noight!

God be good till yez, allanna! exclaimed Ellen, an kape death from
uz all for many a day!

Then they crouched down beside the ice box, betraying every symptom of
great grief.

Divil a tear did I see in her eyes, muttered Ellen.

Shes vexed at not gittin the bit av money, said her sister in the
same low tone.

Then they began muttering prayers in the Irish tongue; the others
watched them, silently, from time to time exchanging intelligent nods.
Then the sisters began swaying their bodies back and forth in unison,
and the other old woman rose to her feet.

Its comin, said she, divil choke thim!

A long, low wail burst from them that immediately filled the kitchen
doorway with the grinning faces of the men. It was the weird death cry
of the Irish race, with which they lamented the passage of a soul, in
their island home. Mary quickly approached the women and spoke a few
determined words; they bounced upon their feet angrily.

Shame on yez, Mary Carroll, cried Ellen.

Is it prevint our showin our rayspects till the dead yed be doin?
demanded Bridget.

The custom is not understood in this country, said Mary quietly; and
they flounced indignantly down upon the sofa and glowered about them.

Luk at that stuck-up shtrap, McGlorys wife, makin game av uz,
muttered Bridget. Sure an iv shed git her drunken brother out av the
House av Correction t wud be fitter for her!

Ah, the big, fat hussy! exclaimed Ellen, its well I raymimber the
toime whin her owld man drove an ash cart, an hersilf tuk in washin.

All unknowing, Mrs. McGlory was smoothing out her silk dress and hoping
that the others noticed the sparkle of her chip diamond ring.

Mary, inquired she, leaning forward as far as her tight waist would
permit, is it owld Kate Sweeney yezll have till lay him out?

I hadnt thought of that, answered Mary, but I suppose so.

Kate do have illigant taste, affirmed Mrs. Clancy.

Troth she do that! spoke Mrs. McGonagle, an sorra a few have doide
in the parish in the last thirty years that she havent put the shroud
on. Yell have till have some wan, Mary, an yez moight as well put the
troifle av money in the poor owld craytures way.
