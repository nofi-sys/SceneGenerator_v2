Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
I am afraid you are incorrigible. You know very well thats not what I
mean.

O, isnt it? ruefully. Perhaps you wouldnt mind telling me how I am
at fault. I dont want to be told. Iam very sensitive, as sensitive as
aa nettle, so please do let me down easy, thats a good fellow, she
said in a wheedling tone.

You are not sensitive. You dont care what any one says or thinks of
you.

Dont I? Then I must be desperately wicked. My mother used to say that
Dont Care represented total depravity.

It is evident you do not care what I think of you, Donald said,
looking straight before him.

Mr. Bartram, your discernment is wonderful; or is it intuition?
Whichever it is, you arrive at correct conclusions. What did you kill
when you went hunting last week? Lovely little birds, whose song has
been wantonly stilled forever?

Indeed, no. I am not so wicked as to kill song birds, not even though
heartless women delight to decorate their hats with their dead bodies.

Ugh, I do not, said Tibby, with a shudder. I dont even like women
who are thoughtless enough to wear them. They are as bad as the Indians
who love to dangle scalp-locks from their belts.

Granted it is thoughtlessness rather than carelessness, why do you not
make it your business to do missionary work among your fashionable
sisters and help save the birds.

The girl shook her head slowly.

I havent enough influence. I do use what I have. But it does no good.
Womans vanity is such that she will sacrifice even the lives of
innocent little birds for the sake of adding to her finery. O, I am
really disgusted with my sex when I think of it.

Why not use the other power you have and make women see this as you
do?

Tibby looked at Donald thoughtfully.

Ill do it. When I get back to

Civilization, you mean. Why not say it? I shall not be offended.

The first service I attend in church Ill make every woman feel the
weight of the poor bird upon her hat, if possible. It shall be the
heaviest sin upon her conscience. She shall feel the Thou shalt not
kill. But you have not told me what you did kill.

Nothing except prairie chickens and a gray wolf.

Are there wolves here?

Not right here, perhaps, but not many miles away. You may see them in
the gray of the morning standing on the top of the sandhills, apparently
taking a survey of the country.

The gray wolf like a sentinel stands, quoted Tibby. Do you know I
dont like to think of hunting or killing anything and I think the
reason so many accidents happen to hunters is because the spirits of the
victims come back to play mischief with the guns.

If you really believe that, you are a spiritist, are you not? Donald
asked absently as he looked at the glowing face before him. It is a
fact there are a great many accidents among hunters.

Yes, guns are discharged unaccountably. If we may believe the Eastern
religions that our souls are reclothed in the form of animals, why may
not one of these freed spirits avenge itself; that is, if it be
permitted to drift about in ether and overlook us?

Or if there is an animals heaven. You know Professor Russell saw the
spirit of my cat.

So I heard. It must have been a spirituelle cat.

You look very pretty with your hat tilted in that way, Donald said
irrelevantly.

Thank you, but such a remark is entirely foreign to the subject under
discussion and in very bad taste, replied Tibby, with a pout of her red
lips. To punish you, I shall not speak to you for a long time.

Wont you, he answered dreamily, his eyes partly closed against the
half-veiled sun.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Donald and Tibby are discussing the hunting of animals and the possibility of animals coming back to haunt hunters after they are killed. Tibby expresses her belief that this is possible and Donald does not argue with her. He changes the subject abruptly, telling her that she looks pretty with her hat tilted in that way. Tibby is offended by his comment and tells him that she will not speak to him for a long time.
