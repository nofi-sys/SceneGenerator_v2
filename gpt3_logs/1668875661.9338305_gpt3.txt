SCENE:
VII


Topham never remembered how he got through the next hour. He went from
place to place with Risdon, talked and laughed, met men--some of them
famous men, too--but he did it all mechanically. His thoughts were with
the girl whom he had seen in the automobile--the girl with whom he had
crossed from New York--the girl who had told him her name was Elsa
Ferreira--the girl who had warned him to be careful. Clearly she was
one of the conspirators against himself, but he did not care. He had
given the letter safely to Risdon and was free to act for himself for
twenty-four hours--till it was time to leave Berlin.

When at last the hour for luncheon was at hand and he could leave
Risdon on a plea that he must hurry back to the embassy, he did so with
an alacrity which he feared the reporter would detect.

Once alone he lost no time in making his way to the ornate stone
pile that Risdon had pointed out to him as the home of the Count and
Countess of Ouro Preto.

Scarcely could he control himself while he waited for a reply to the
card he sent up. It seemed to him incredible that it had been only that
morning that he had parted from Elsa--he thought of her as Elsa--at the
steamer. It seemed weeks even since he had gazed into her eyes across
the traffic that thronged the street.

By and by a man came down the stairs. Topham recognized him as his
Spanish-American acquaintance of the cigarette episode and grinned.
Theyre all in it, he observed. But I dont care. I dont care a
continental damn.

He turned as a trim maid servant came running down the stairs, and
bowed before him.

The wohlgebornen Grafin will receive the Herr Lieutenant Topham, she
said. Be pleased to walk up!

Topham did so without delay.

As he entered her apartment the countess rose, and for an instant the
two stared at each other. Curiosity was in that gaze, for those two
had learned much about each other since they had parted. Defiance was
in it, for both felt instinctively that their wills were to clash and
both were ready for the encounter; fascination--or something strangely
akin to fascination--was in it. The pause was that of two fencers
who hesitate before they cross swords. It was for a second only, then
the countess swept forward and held out her hand. Mr. Topham? she
murmured. I am glad to see you.

Topham bowed as he took the hand in his. She wore a wonderful gown of
clinging silk against which her dark beauty scintilated star-like. He
could not speak. Her loveliness and what it meant--must mean--to him in
the future took his breath away and held him for the moment dumb.

But you ought not to have come! she went on, slowly, when he did not
speak.

Topham shook his head. You knew I would come, he declared, meaningly.

The countess flushed, and Topham pushed the fight. Did you not know
it? he demanded.

Changing emotion swept across the countesss mobile face. Surprise,
indignation, panic succeeded each other and at last gave place to an
expression hard to define. She flushed, trembled slightly; and her eyes
dropped before those of the man who still held her hand.

Yes! she breathed. Yes! I knew.

Ahem! An elderly lady had risen and came forward and seemed somewhat
amazed by the scene. Ahem! Ahem! she coughed, and then more
violently, Ahem!

The countess started. One would have said that she had forgotten her
companion, which was singular for a girl brought up under the duenna
system, however much she might have emancipated herself. Then she
turned. You know the Baroness Ostersacken, Mr. Topham, she said.

Topham bowed. Yes! he said. I know.

Ach! Gott! The baroness seemed confused. You are welcome, Herr
Topham, she declared. Will you not be seated?

The countess led the way to a window beside which two chairs were
placed, while the baroness, waddling back to the seat some distance
away, from which she had risen, picked up some fancy work.

The countess sat down and indicated the chair by her side. Sit down,
Mr. Topham, she invited.
