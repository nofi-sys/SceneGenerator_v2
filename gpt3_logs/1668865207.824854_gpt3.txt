SCENE:
There was a less difficult task with the women, whose sorrow was too
deep for words. Then Dr MColl agreed with Mr Hindes that they had
better travel down to Dover by an early train on the morrow, as every
endeavour was being made to have the inquest on that day, on account
of the hot weather rendering it desirable to get the burial over as
quickly as possible. Hindes shuddered at the thought, but showed no
emotion beyond that which was evinced by his white face and silent
demeanour. Luncheon was then served for the doctor, and he departed to
interview Mr Philip Walcheren on the matter, when Henry Hindes was free
to return home.

Here, as may be imagined, he had a difficult task before him, but he
felt freer, for, in the presence of his wife, who had loved Jenny
Crampton so dearly, he was not ashamed to break down himself, and give
some relief to his overcharged feelings. Hannahs grief was extreme,
but she tried to curb it for the sake of her husband, who only rose in
her estimation for the tears and moans which he felt he might indulge
in at last.

Both husband and wife had quite exhausted themselves with their
emotion, when a servant entered to announce that a constable desired to
speak to his master. Hannah could not help observing how vividly white
Henry became at this intimation. She could not understand it, unless
the sad events of the day had so undermined his usual intrepidity as to
make him start at shadows.

Only a constable, Henry, dear, she repeated, seeing how he trembled.
It is probably something to do with this unhappy business! Will you
see him here?

No! no! replied her husband, as he wiped the sweat from his
forehead, not here! Let him wait, Johnson! I will be with him
presently--presently!

Could anything have been discovered? he thought to himself, as he leant
against the form of his wife for support, and she passed her cambric
handkerchief across his wet hair. Was it possible he had dropped any
article belonging to him on the spot where he and Jenny had stood
together? Had this man come to tell him that he was suspected, and must
consider himself under arrest until the inquest had been held on the
morrow?

He pushed Hannahs kindly ministrations away and stood upright.

I cannot see him in this condition, he said, alluding to his swollen
eyelids and stained cheeks. I must go to my room first and smooth my
hair.

He escaped by a back way as he spoke, and gaining his dressing-room,
arranged his toilet a little. Then he searched in a drawer for a bottle
of morphia, which he had been occasionally in the habit of taking to
induce sleep, for the condition of his mind regarding Jenny Crampton
had not been conducive to sound and restful repose.

If I am taken away from here, he thought, I will not reach Dover.
They shall see I know a trick worth two of that.

He thrust the vial in his breast and descended to the hall to interview
the constable. But he had come on a very simple errand. He had received
information from the Dover police that the inquiry on the death of Mrs
Walcheren had been fixed for the morrow, and that Mr Hindes presence
would be necessary.

You see, sir, said the man, fumbling with his papers, were sorry
to trouble you, but as you went down to Dover to see the lady, it
is necessary the coroner should hear the why and the wherefore of
everything to come to a right understanding of the case. Its a sad
thing, aint it, sir? A poor young creature done to death in a moment,
as you may say, and only married on the Friday.

A frightful thing, indeed, constable! replied Hindes.

The poor gentleman, they say, is almost out of his senses, as he well
may be, continued the policeman; they cant get him away from the
corpse, and he turns round like a madman on any one who proposes of it.
Perhaps so be youre a relation, sir!

No, no; only a friend, said Hindes, quickly.

Well, he ought to have some friend by him now, if all they tell me is
true, for the shock seems to have unsettled his mind. The inquiry wont
be till three oclock to-morrow afternoon, sir, at the Bottle and
Spurs public-house, where the poor lady lies. If youre there, sir,
theyll get it over at once, but if so be as youre not there, the jury
will have to be called to attend another day.

I shall be there, replied Henry Hindes, and then he went upstairs
again and replaced the vial in the drawer before he rejoined his wife.
Only a notice to attend this miserable inquest, my dear, he said in
explanation as he threw himself on a couch and buried his face in his
hands.
