SCENE:
Shes coming in soon. She just wanted to see the end of the sunset.

She passed into the hall, sorry--oh, so sorry! But the library door
was open and she halted, poised birdlike for one glance. The man at
the desk had his back to her and she said nothing, yet he turned, gave
a smothered sound and jumped up. She shut her eyes as she felt his
arms go about her and his kisses on her hair, her senses blurred in a
strange ineffably sweet confusion of timidity and delight.

Oh, Anne, she heard his voice between the kisses. I was waiting for
you.

Some one will see us, she whispered. Take care.

She could feel the beating of his heart through his coat. Her hands
went up to his shoulders feeling along the rough tweed and with her
lids down-drooped she lifted her face.

Darling, he breathed, when the kiss was over, I thought you were
never coming.

I had to stay with Sybil. She didnt want to be alone.

But _you_ wanted to be here?

Just _here_, she laid a finger on his breast and broke into
smothered, breathless laughter.

He laughed too and they drew apart, their hands sliding together and
interlocking. It was all so new, so bewilderingly entrancing, that they
did not know how to express it, the man staring wonder-struck, the
girl, with her quivering laughter that was close to tears, looking this
way and that, not knowing where to look.

I ought to go, she whispered. Theyll be coming, but made no move.

Wait till they do. Then with a sudden practical facing of realities,
When will we be married?

Oh, not for ages! Im not used to being engaged yet!

I am--I never was before but I must have had a talent for it, Ive
taken to it so well.

Oh, Hugh! Her laughter came more naturally, his with it. They were
like a pair of children, delighting in a little secret. Wont they be
surprised when they hear? Nobody has a suspicion of it.

She looked so enchanting with her eyebrows arched in mischievous query
that he made a movement to clasp her again, and then came the creak of
an opening door from the floor above.

Hist! she held up a warning hand and slid away, her face, glancing
back for a last look, beautiful in its radiant joy.

Bassett moved to the stair-foot. Once again he had to come down to
earth with a bump. He passed his hand over his face as if to wipe off
an expression incompatible with disagreeable interviews. This must be
Joe.

It _was_ Joe, dressed for travel in knickerbockers and a Norfolk
jacket, a golf cap on the back of his head. He carried an overcoat
across his arm, in his hands a suit-case and a fishing-rod done up in
a canvas case. At the sight of Bassett he halted, and the elder man
noticed a change in his expression, a quick focusing to attention.

Oh, he said. Want to see me, Bassett?

Yes, I want to speak to you before you go.

Joe descended. Stopping a step above Bassett, he set down his baggage
and leaned on the banister, politely waiting.

Bassett spoke with lowered voice:

I heard something this morning that I can hardly believe--an
accusation against you. That youve been using your position here to
act as one of the police spies whove been keeping tab on Sybil.

The boy looked at him with impenetrable eyes and answered in the same
lowered key:

Who told you that?

She did. She accuses you of having come here with that intention, got
the job knowing that no outsiders were to be allowed on the island.

Bassett was certain he had paled under his tan, but his face retained a
masklike passivity.
