SCENE:
He rose, thrust his arms in the sleeves of his coat, and pulled his cap
down over his head. He glanced into a tiny mirror. His beard on chin and
upper lip showed prominently. He had not shaved for days. There was a
fighting light in his eyes, however, which had always been with him.

Im not beat! he declared as he passed out the cabin and into a
narrow, steel-lined alley-way. Ill find Saidee and talk things over.

The alley-way terminated at a ladder which led to the deck. Flanking
this ladder, to port and starboard, were two closed doors. Fay went up
and lifted a hatch. He staggered to the duck-boards and gripped an iron
railing. He glanced about with his eyes widening at the wilderness of
water and fog and spindrift.

The super-destroyer was knifing westward like a hurtled javelin. Her
four funnels belched fire and oily smoke. Her superstructure of nested
boats, ventilators, pilot-house, chart-house, battened guns and two
taper signal-masts vibrated and throbbed under the steady hammering of
the high-speed engines.

The dawn was breaking to the eastward. A yellow light was on the fog. A
sea bird wheeled and fell astern. A great wave curled the sharp bow,
combed the flush decks and seethed to leeward.

Fay wound his fingers about the rail and turned until he faced the after
part of the destroyer. A few of the crew were on deck. They crouched in
the lee of shelters. The stern gun had a jaunty tilt to its long muzzle.
A mark showed on the sponson where a German shell had exploded.

Saidee Isaacs appeared in oil-skins and a yellow southwester. She was
followed by the lean form of MacKeenon. They worked forward and stood by
Fays side. They swayed with the movements of the fast-flying destroyer.

Yon is Scotland, said MacKeenon. Ye are in the heart of the North
Sea.

Where do we land? asked Fay.

The Firth o Tayat Dundee or Perth.

Saidee Isaacs pulled down the brim of her southwester and stared
forward. She pressed her fingers against Fays arm.

Well be in London by tomorrow afternoon, she said warningly.

Fay nodded. He was helpless. There was no possible escape from facing
Sir Richard.

A have sent a wireless, said MacKeenon between gusts of wind. They
will be expecting distinguished guests, he added dryly. A warn ye both
that if ye have the cipher-key or know where it can be gottendont
destroy it or cause it to be whisked away. It is also the key to
Dartmoor.

Then Im gone, thought Fay as he glanced at the girl. She shook her
head slightly. Her fingers uncoiled from the rail. Her hand passed
slowly over her mouth. She had indicated silence without MacKeenon
catching the motion.

Fay dropped his eyes and glanced at the hatch. Lets go below, he
said. Im getting wet and cold up here. How about some breakfast, Mac?

Ye shall both be served, said the Scot. A shall breakfast with ye
both.

The morning passed in the silence of the ward-room. Afternoon deepened
the light that came through the port-holes. Green changed to opal, and
opal to gray. Fog swirled and wound the destroyer with a protecting
cloak. The speed was not reduced until the old mine barrier was reached
off the Scotch coast. A shot gave the warning. Voices called from ship
to ship. Once the bright flare of a two-second light flashed and was
gone. They entered the Firth of Tay and glided for the anchorage off
Dundee.

A quick passage, was all that MacKeenon said as the rattle of the
anchor chain followed the shutting down of the engines.

Fay waited in the ward-room as Saidee Isaacs went for her hat and
gloves. She returned within a minute. She stood erect and faced the Scot
as two ensigns came down through the companion and saluted.

Ye go with us, said the inspector. There shall be a mon or twa
waiting in Dundee. Passage has been booked for the south. A think it
will be long after midnight when we board the Royal Scotsman for London.
A hae no doot yell thank the commander for me.

The ensigns stared at the girl admiringly. They saluted and started up
the ladder which led to the deck. Fay preceded Saidee Isaacs. MacKeenon
waited discreetly, then climbed rapidly upward. The group stood on the
dark deck of the destroyer. Lights showed where ships rode at anchor. A
diadem of fire rimmed the quays and water front. A hotel added its glow
over the citys housetops. All this was a glimpse of England to Fay. He
turned as he heard a metallic sound. MacKeenon had opened a pair of
handcuffs. They clicked softly upon the cracksmans protesting right
wrist.
