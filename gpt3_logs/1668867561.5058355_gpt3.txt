SCENE:
XI EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY


Whee! then theres a nigger in the woodpile, I should say! burst out
the impulsive Ballyhoo. That smart old Badger has been too tricky for
our skipper. Why, if those fellows have been on the island all the
while, of course its dollars to doughnuts theyve watched everything
weve done, and know that were working on that old hulk of a wreck!

No doubt about it, said Oscar promptly, shutting his jaws together in
the way his chums knew meant business.

What ought we to do about it, Oscar? continued Ballyhoo.

First of all we must get across to our boat in as big a hurry as we
can, came the answer. Captain Shooks ought to know whats in the
wind, so he can act.

What dye suppose he can do about it? continued the Jones boy.

They had already turned, and were making off hastily; and their last
glimpse of the retreating boat showed them the two men handling the
oars just as carefully as before.

Well have to wait and see, snapped Oscar. But dont talk any more
than you can help, Ballyhoo; well need all our wind for running.

They had one advantage, since in returning they followed the tracks
they had made in coming. Thus they could avoid certain obstructions
that had delayed them more or less on the former occasion.

Arriving at the other end of the island they found Jack sitting there,
still busily engaged with his camera. He had evidently taken what
pictures he wanted, and was amusing himself while waiting for the
return of his chums.

Upon seeing the pair come rushing out of the palmetto scrub he
scrambled to his feet, looking more or less alarmed.

What is it--a bear, or a wildcat? he demanded, starting to place his
precious camera and tripod in the boat, so as to be ready for a hasty
departure.

Get away from here in a hurry, Jack! gasped Ballyhoo; weve seen
something that threatens all sorts of tough things, and Captain Shooks
ought to know about the same.

The boat was launched without loss of time, Ballyhoo even wading in the
wash of the sea up to his knees, in order to shove off, for that was
the kind of a fellow the Jones boy was.

Then the paddles fairly flew, and they sped out toward the spot where
the float and the squatty submarine lay. How fortunate, Oscar told
himself as he worked his paddle, that the undersea boat chanced to be
on the surface just then. Had it been otherwise the delay consequent
upon getting their message to the skipper might have made all the
difference imaginable with regard to results.

Captain Shooks was on the float talking with the diver, who had
apparently just before come to the surface. Oscar noticed that the
bronzed face of the skipper appeared to be wreathed in a broad smile,
as though he had received some happy news in the report of the diver.

As the three boys hastened to climb aboard the float, he called out to
them:

Well, weve struck oil, lads! What dye think of that for a starter,
now?

He was holding something out toward them, and the boys could see first
of all that it required an effort for him to do so, as though the
brick-like object might be quite heavy. They stared hard at it. So far
as a first look went there did not seem to be anything very remarkable
about the thing. It had a peculiar, greenish look, as though the action
of the sea water had covered it with a slime in all the long years that
it had lodged there far down in the depths.

What is it? asked Ballyhoo eagerly, yet evidently puzzled to guess
the truth.

Bullion! said Captain Shooks with a queer chuckle, some of the bully
stuff that we organized this expedition to find. And Hicks here says
theres more down in the bowels of the old Spanish galleon where he got
this, much more!

Oh! what dye think of that, now? cried Ballyhoo, reaching out his
hands for the weighty object, and showing by his actions as soon as he
received it that he had all he could do to hold the same, it was so
heavy.
