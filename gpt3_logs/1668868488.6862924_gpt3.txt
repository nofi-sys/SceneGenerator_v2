Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
In my youth, they were not so far advanced, there was no medium between
the absolute denial of all visions and a blind belief in apparitions.
They laughed at those who were tormented by these visions that were
attributed to credulity and fear, and only excused in cases of serious
illness.

So during this terrible watch, I reprimanded myself severely and
unjustly for my weakness of mind, without ever once thinking of
attributing it all to the effect of a bad digestion or atmospherical
influence. Such an idea would have been entertained with difficulty as
with the exception of a little fatigue and bad humor I did not feel in
the least ill.

Thoroughly resolved to boast of my adventure to no one, I retired and
slept very well until Baptiste knocked at my door to inform me that
breakfast would soon be ready. I admitted him after having thoroughly
convinced myself that my door had remained bolted, as I had previously
assured myself before going to sleep; I had observed, and I again
noticed that the other door of my apartment was in a like condition. I
counted the large screws which secured the tiles of the fire-place. I
sought in vain for the slightest indication of a secret door.

Besides, of what use would it be, said I to myself, whilst Baptiste was
powdering my hair; have I not seen an object without substance, a robe,
or a shroud which vanished beneath my touch?

Without this conclusive circumstance, I might have attributed it all to
a joke of Madame dIonis, as I learned from Baptiste that she had
returned the evening before towards midnight.

This news snatched me from my preoccupation. I bestowed particular pains
upon my _coiffure_ and my toilet, and was a little vexed that the nature
of my profession condemned me to wear black; but my mother had supplied
me with such fine linen and such well cut coats that I considered myself
on the whole, very presentable. I was neither ill-looking or badly
formed. I resembled my mother, who had been very beautiful, and without
being foppish, I was accustomed to remark the general approval that a
pleasing countenance produces.

Madame dIonis was in the _salon_ when I entered. I beheld a bewitching
woman indeed; but much too small to have figured in my trio of spectres.
Neither was there anything fantastical or diaphanous about her. Hers was
a realistic beauty, fresh, gay, lively, expressing gracefully, what was
designed in the style of the period, an amiable embonpoint, discussing
every subject clearly and sensibly, and revealing great energy of
character combined with singular sweetness of manner.

After exchanging several words with her, I understood how, thanks to so
much intelligence and resolution, candor and cleverness, she managed to
live on good terms with a pretty bad husband and a very stupid
mother-in-law.

Scarcely had we begun breakfast, when the dowager, scrutinizing me
closely, declared that I looked ill and pale, although I had so far
forgotten my adventure as to eat with a good appetite, and to be
pleasantly affected by the amiable attention of my beautiful hostess.

Then recollecting Zphyrines instructions, I hastened to say that I had
slept well and had had very pleasant dreams.

Ah! I was sure of it, cried the old lady evidently enchanted. One
always sleeps well in that room. Tell us your dreams, Monsieur
Nivires.

They were very confused; still I think I can remember a lady.

Only one?

Perhaps two!

Perhaps three also? said Madame dIonis, smiling.

Precisely, madame, you remind me that they were three!

Pretty? said the triumphant dowager.

Rather pretty, but somewhat faded.

Really? said Madame dIonis, who seemed to communicate through her
eyes with Zphyrine (who was seated at the lower end of the table), in
order to answer me. And what did they say to you?

Incomprehensible things. But if it interests madame, the dowager
Countess, I will do my utmost to remember.

Ah! my dear child, said the dowager, it interests me more than I can
say. I will explain by and by. Begin by telling us.

But it will be very difficult for me to tell. Can any one recount a
dream?
