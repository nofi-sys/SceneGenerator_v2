What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Do you know that they offered gold?

They offered all the gold they found, so the histories say: thousands
of pounds for hundreds of years: believe some of what you see and a
tenth of what you hear: it is still likely that they brought a lot of
gold here, and here it is still.

That will be a find.

Well, what do you say to giving me a hand to get it? Ive cleared this
space by the help of the Indians, but Im not going to have these
Indians looking for the gold: not likely. That is the white mans perk:
none of my brown brothers in this for me: no fear: the hunting parties
would go wearing gold till the Barboes learned of it: news soon spreads
in this forest. Then we should have the Government in. As you can see,
its more than a one mans job in there, but I reckon that two could
shift the stuff and find the altar. And wed need two to get the gold
melted down and into Santa Barb. They buy it there, pesos for weight,
at the Assay Office. I tell you, the Ballarat field is just footle to
it. This is Tom Tiddlers ground, that the kids play.

It sounds pretty thrilling, Hi said.

Thrilling? I guess it is thrilling: p.d. thrilling.

Im awfully keen on getting to Anselmo first, Hi said.

I know you are, the man said, I know you are. But what is Anselmo
beside what I offer you here? We should shift our traps to here for a
couple of weeks, and after that what would Anselmo be? Why, you would be
able to buy Anselmo: buy it ten times over and all thats in it: miss
and mister. And Id be a lord at home and have a bloody deer-park.

Yes, I know, Hi said. I say, it sounds exciting. But have you any
picks and crow-bars?

Yes, in a stone trough there: out of the way of the ants.

I suppose we could get done in a couple of weeks?

Well have to, for the sooner we lift it the better. Not that anyone
will come.

You mean that the fever will come down?

No, but these Aracuis go talking: and news spreads. Shall we start,
then? What do you say? Off saddle and at it?

Id like to, frightfully, Hi said.

Well, here you are then, the man said. Ill give you a third share in
anything we find: very likely a million pounds.

I say, thats generous. But before we start work, Hi said, Id like
frightfully just to walk along the building and look at it, from close
to. Ive never seen one of these places before.

Look your bellyful, the man said. I hoped youd see sense when it
came to the point. Ill get the picks along.

The man kept his eyes upon Hi, who took a pace back to consider the
front of the building. He did not see the temple: it was all a blur of
angry gods topped by a foam of flowers and the spears of palms in a
glare of light as red as blood. He knew that the man was watching him:
he knew that the man had killed Wigmore so that he might be alone in
possession. The facts of the murder were all bright in his brain.
Wigmore, the scholar, had found the place and cleared it. Then this man,
the wanderer and waster, had come thither, by some Fate or chance, and
had murdered Wigmore. Now that he himself had come thither, the man
wished him to help in the finding and the raising of the treasure. If he
refused, he would have a bullet in his brain within ten seconds. If he
accepted, he would have a weeks or a fortnights toil: then the bullet.
If he tried to escape, what hope had he, save to wander in the fever
forest in the fever season till he died miserably or was lost in the
marsh?

Well start in that door where the tree was, the man said. It may not
have been the main entrance, but the stone is all worn away there by
peoples feet: it is a used entrance.

All right, Hi said, with the words sticking in his throat. He did not
know what he was to do; there was nothing that he could do. He felt
suddenly that there was nothing for it but to plunge into the forest,
cost what it might. Ill never get out of it, he thought. But
anything to get away from this fellow.

The building faced him, running north and south across the clearing.
They were standing close together nearly opposite the central point.

Well, have you looked enough? the man asked. Youll have plenty of
chance to look at it in the next ten days or so.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two main characters. The man has murdered Wigmore in order to get the treasure for himself, and now he wants Hi to help him find it. Hi is reluctant to help, but he knows that he has no other choice if he wants to stay alive.
