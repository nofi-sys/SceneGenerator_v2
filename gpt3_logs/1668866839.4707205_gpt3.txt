Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
I hope so, Nah-ee-lah, I said, but without a rope or wings I do not
see how we are going to accomplish it.

In the mouth of the tunnel, explained Nah-ee-lah, there are long
poles, each of which has a hook at one end. Ages ago there were no other
means of ingress or egress to the city and those who came out to hunt or
for any other purpose came through this long tunnel from the city, and
from the ledge below they raised their poles and placed the hooked ends
over the rim of the crater, after which it was a simple matter to
clamber up or down the poles as they wished; but it has been long since
these tunnels were used by the people of Va-nah, who had no further need
of them after the perfection of the flying wings which you saw me using
when I was captured by the Va-gas.

If they used poles, so may we, I said, since there are plenty of
young trees growing close to the rim of the crater. The only difficulty
will be in felling one of them.

We can do that, said Nah-ee-lah, if we can find some sharp fragments
of stone. It will be slow work, but it can be done, and she started
immediately to hunt for a fragment with a cutting edge. I joined her in
the search and it was not long before we had discovered several pieces
of obsidian with rather sharp edges. We then started to work upon a
young tree about four inches in diameter that grew almost straight for a
height of some thirty feet.

Cutting the tree down with our bits of lava glass was tedious work, but
finally it was accomplished, and we were both much elated when the tree
toppled and fell to the ground. Cutting away the branches occupied
almost as long a time, but that, too, was finally accomplished. The next
problem which confronted us was that of making the top of the pole
secure enough to hold while we descended to the ledge before the mouth
of the tunnel. We had no rope and nothing with which to fashion one,
other than my garments, which I was loth to destroy, inasmuch as in
these higher altitudes it was often cold. Presently, however, I hit upon
a plan which, if Nah-ee-lahs muscles and my nerves withstood the strain
it put upon them, bade fair to assure the success of our undertaking. I
lowered the larger end of the pole over the side of the crater until the
butt rested upon the ledge before the mouth of the tunnel. Then I turned
to Nah-ee-lah.

Lie down flat at full length, Nah-ee-lah, I directed her, and hold
this pole securely with both hands. You will only have to keep it from
toppling to the sides or outward, and to that, I think, your strength is
equal. While you hold it, I will descend to the mouth of the tunnel and
raise one of the regular hooked poles which you say should be deposited
there. If they are not, I believe that I can hold our own pole securely
from below while you descend. She looked over into the vast abyss below
and shuddered. I can hold it at the top, she said, if the bottom does
not slip from the ledge.

That is a chance that I shall have to take, I replied, but I will
descend very carefully and I think there will be little danger upon that
score.

I could see, upon a more careful examination of the ledge below, that
there was some danger of an accident such as she suggested.

Nah-ee-lah took her position as I had directed and lay grasping the pole
securely in both hands at the rim of the crater, which was absolutely
perpendicular at this point, and I prepared to make the perilous
descent.

I can assure you that my sensations were far from pleasurable as I
looked over into that awful abyss. The crater itself was some four or
five miles in diameter, and, as I had every reason to suspect, extended
fully two hundred and fifty miles through the lunar crust to the surface
of the Moon. It was one of the most impressive moments of my life as I
clung balancing upon the edge of that huge orifice, gazing into the
silent, mysterious depths below. And then I seized the pole very gently
and lowered myself over the edge.

Courage, Julian! whispered Nah-ee-lah; I shall hold very tight.

I shall be quite safe, Nah-ee-lah, I assured her. I must be safe, for
if I am not, how are you to reach the ledge and Laythe?

As I descended very slowly I tried not to think at all, but to exclude
from my mind every consideration of the appalling depths beneath me. I
could not have been more than two feet from the ledge when the very
thing that we both tried so hard to guard against transpireda
splintered fragment of the poles butt crumpled beneath my weight and
that slight jar was just sufficient to start the base of my precarious
ladder sliding toward the edge of the narrow projection upon which I had
rested it, and beyond which lay eternity. Above me I heard a slight
scream and then the pole slipped from the ledge and I felt myself
falling.

It was over in an instant. My feet struck the ledge and I threw myself
within the mouth of the tunnel. And then, above me, I heard Nah-ee-lahs
voice crying in agonized tones:
