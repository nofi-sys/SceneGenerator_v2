SCENE:
XVI
AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE


Among the visitors at Lissas home was one whom she at first received
with scant hospitality, if not actual discourtesy. This was Professor
Russell.

How he had chanced to come to their neighborhood she never knew. He had
accompanied her husband home from the post one evening, and the dismay
she felt at the sight of him had not been easily disguised.

Why he should have sought them was a question that often returned to her
as the months brought frequent visits from him, sometimes prolonged into
weeks of sojourn in the neighborhood. Sometimes for months nothing would
be seen of him, then suddenly he would appear like a dangerous comet,
bringing a feeling of uneasiness to Lissa, wherefore she could not have
told.

When inquired of as to his wanderings and uncertain appearances, he
always said he had been in the East, but added no further account of
himself.

Lissa at first distrusted and disliked him instinctively. His bland,
insinuating manner was thrown away upon her, she told herself.

And yet she feared him too much to refuse him admittance to her home.
Since that night when, at the house of Squire Bartram, he had so
accurately described her brother-in-laws encounter with the Sioux she
had not doubted his power of divination or clairvoyance, or whatever the
faculty might be termed. But it was an uncanny, unpleasant power, and
she felt a shudder of superstitious terror whenever he approached her.

She would have been glad of any justifiable pretext to keep him from
visiting them, and was happy when the weeks would roll by without his
appearing among them.

This feeling, however, gradually wore away in some measure as she became
more accustomed to his presence, and as her sister, and later her
mother, became interested in his theories, she began to tolerate with
more patience his teaching of spiritism.

He held frequent seances in the neighborhood, and many of the families
about her had become more or less interested in the doctrines, few of
them openly opposing them and their teacher, except her handsome
brother-in-law, Mark Cramer. He was outspoken in his condemnation of
both the man and his _ism_.

One mild November afternoon, when the sisters and mother were together
at Lissas home, the name of a sister who had died in infancy was
mentioned.

If, said Alice, there is any truth in Professor Russells
communications, I would like to have him bring me word from Elsie. No
one here, not even Mark, knows of her having existed, as we so rarely
mention her.

Lissa assented, and observed that it was the anniversary of her death,
the thirteenth of November.

Before they had finished their conversation upon the topic they were
startled by a rap at the outer door and Lissa opened it to see the
ubiquitous Professor himself, who, after shaking hands with the sisters
and Mrs. Clyne, seated himself, and without asking for either Nathan or
Mark, observed suavely:

As both of your husbands are to be at home to-day, I called to see if
we might not invite in some of the neighbors and hold a seance this
evening.

But Nathan is absent, said Lissa, and will not be home until
Saturday.

And Mark is out upon the plains, forty miles from here, added Alice.

The Professor smiled indulgently.

They are both coming home and will be here before evening, he said
with an air of assurance.

The three women exchanged glances. Was this but talk, or did he have the
power of unveiling the future as well as the past? Or did he
clairvoyantly see Nathan and Mark directing their course thither-ward?

You speak with conviction, Professor, Lissa at length replied. Have
you received intelligence from the absent ones which is not known to
us?

That which I see, ye cannot now perceive, the man said sententiously.
Yet the time is coming when you as well shall have the power to lift
the veil which hides the dreaded unknown and learn the mysteries which
are only revealed to those who are willing to seek in the right manner
and submit themselves to the spirit influences which surround them. You
can never know, Mrs. Clyne, the peace you will experience when you have
ceased to resist and rebel against the gentle influences which seek only
to promote your happiness and well-being. There is one angelic form now
hovering about you and anxiously striving to win recognition from those
so near and dear to her when on earth.
