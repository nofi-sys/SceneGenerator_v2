SCENE:
VI

THE THREE HORSEMEN


When Mr. Manley entered Rimors he looked sharply about him. After
the bright sunshine of the street, the subdued light in the
restaurant, due to shaded windows, caused the cattleman to squint
his eyes. He hitched up his belt, from which, in a holster, hung a
heavy revolver, and walked forward.

A bar, ostensibly for the serving of soft drinks, ran from the front
of Rimors place to the rear. To the right of this, on the other
side of the room, were a number of tables, three with signs on them,
Reserved for Ladies. These tables were the excuse for the title
Restaurant.

An odor of staleness permeated the room. Flies buzzed lazily in the
hot, close air. When the ranchman entered the only other person in
the place was the bartender, an aproned figure with New York
plainly written on his patent leather shoes and slick plastered-down
hair. He sat on a chair in front of the bar, eagerly reading a
week-old copy of a Manhattan paper.

As the cattleman approached, the barkeeper raised his eyes from the
paper and calmly surveyed Mr. Manley.

Well, Manley, what can I do for you? he asked in a surly voice.
Bardwell Manley was no favorite with the Rimor outfit.

You might do a whole lot, Mr. Manley replied slowly. Then, again,
you might not. You know a puncher who hangs around here with a
checkered shirt?

Do I know a puncher who hangs around here with a checkered shirt?
the barkeeper repeated. Well, now, I cant say that I do. Theres
plenty of punchers that come in here, but I never knew one yet that
hung around with a checkered shirt. Sure its the puncher, and not a
collar that youre lookin for?

Mr. Manley flushed beneath his tan, but he held himself in check.

I guess you know right enough what I mean, he said genially. So
you aint seen him, hey?

No, I aint, the man replied, with an accent of irony on the last
word. He resumed his reading.

Mr. Manley stood for a moment looking down at the hunched figure
before him. He tightened his jaw, and little knobs of muscles showed
just below his ears. To those who knew Bardwell Manley, this was a
sign not to be ignored.

Mind if I take a look around? the cattleman said easily.

Nope! Go as far as you like. The barkeeper did not look up.

Mr. Manley walked toward the rear of the place. As he did so, a man
stepped from a side door and confronted him. It was the cowboy in
the checkered shirt.

Lookin for some one? he asked.

Was. Found him now, Mr. Manley answered shortly. I want to talk
to you. Do you know Gilly Froud?

Suppose I do? the puncher answered insolently.

This much. I think you know something about my broncs that were
stolen from the hitchin rail out there a while ago. Mr. Manley
looked at the man keenly.

Yea? The puncher drew a sack of tobacco and cigarette papers from
his shirt pocket. Deftly he rolled a cigarette and applied a match
to it. Well, suppose I do? he asked, blowing out a cloud of smoke.
His right hand slid inside his heavy shirt and toward his left
armpit.

Mr. Manley saw the motion and his own hand flashed down to his side.
Suddenly there was a wild yell behind him, and an empty bottle
whizzed past his head. The barkeeper, seeing Mr. Manley going for
his gun, had picked up the bottle and aimed for the ranchmans head.

Swift as light Mr. Manley turned. His gun leaped from its holster,
and he brought down the butt end on the barkeepers wrist.

The rascals right arm went limp. He uttered another yell and sank
back in alarm.

At that moment the door burst open, and Pop, followed by Roy and
Teddy, leaped into the room. The barkeeper bent to pick up a bottle
with his left hand, but before he could reach it Roy kicked it into
the corner and shoved his revolver into the mans ribs. Teddy,
seeing that his father was uninjured, made a dash for the man in the
checkered shirt.
