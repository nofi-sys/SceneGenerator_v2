SCENE:
It sounds strangely enough, said Manton, shortly.

I assure you I have no means of accounting for these things, said the
woman in a meek, deprecatory tone.

Suppose you demonstrate it, madam, in my case; and a slight sneer,
which crossed the face of Manton, whose manner had entirely changed,
did not escape the hawk-like quickness of the womans eye. My life, I
am willing to submit to the scrutiny of your inscrutable sense.

Oh, by all means! exclaimed Doctor Weasel, springing to his feet in
a paroxysm of delight. Let us have the experiment, by all means! Do
please place your hand on the top of her head!

Manton turned, and with a bow most studiously deferential, seemed to
ask of the lady her permission to do so.

Oh, yes, yes, and her head was bowed forward to meet his upraised
hand; while the daughter, who seemed to understand the thing, either
from previous experience, or from some private signal, rose from her
clinging position about his knee, and stepped back, leaving the two
alone, without other contact.

In a few moments after the hand of Manton had rested upon the meek,
submissive head of the woman before him, she commenced exhibiting the
common and preliminary attitudes, muscular retchings of the throat,
nervous twitchings of the lips and limbs, accompanied by the apparently
palpable, organic changes, which are recognised to be symptomatic with
well-known conditions of the mesmeric sleep.

Manton watched all these phenomena with the sharpest attention, and
then, as the lips began to move as if in inarticulate enunciation, he
leant forward over her, and asked

What can you tell us of the soul, with which you are now in
communication?

After several preluding and spasmodic efforts to articulate sounds, the
Clairvoyant at length said, in a voice only distinct above a whisper

I see light! all light!pure, holy light. It fills the universe with
a mild radiance! I can see no blurs, no clouds in the foreground. I
can see only angels, seraphs, and seraphim, and all forms of light
revolving in the sphere of this mighty soul!

Is there no evil there? said Manton.

No, I see none; I see only white light.

But look closeperhaps you might find something dark. Look long and
steadily into the world you visitsee if there be not clouds there.

There was a pause. The lips moved without articulation again; and again
Manton askedWhat do you see now?

I see, I see, the light is parting on either side; out in the far
distance, between those walls of light, a giant form uprears itself in
shadow. Down the long vista stands this darkened giant. He is fierce
and stern, and wears a cold, hard front, with flaming eyes, that
scare the ministering angels all away. He strikes around him with the
imperious sway of his huge, knotted club, and all the bright forms
flee. He seems the savage Hercules of pride!

There is a pause; and after a stillness of some moments, Manton asked
again

What now is the vision, to your sense?is the giant gone?

No, he is humbled but not subdued; and from afar behind him, down this
darkened vista, a light has grown up, like a rising star. It advances
slowly, rising over his head. The splendor increases as it comes.
Now, the dark and wrathful giant has fallen on his kneesthe flood of
glory overcomes him. His club is dropped. His eyes, upturned in awe,
seem dimmed by the sudden glory of an angels presence. Ha! I see! the
features of that angel are like his whose soul I see! The giant is
subdued! His pride has bowed its forehead in the dust, before the angel
radiance of a visiting mother!

Manton felt his flesh creep as this was spoken, and as the Clairvoyant
paused for some moments, he asked: What does this spirit of the mother
say?

The slow answer was

She seems to rebuke this pride even more with her effulgence, and
to say, My son, I am with thee in the spirit, but I cannot be with
thee through the medium of the flesh which thou hast so poisoned and
corrupted, since I passed from thee into this higher sphere. Make
thy body clean and purify thy life, and I shall be always with thee
present, in the spirit. It is necessary for your usefulness in your
present life that you should accept of human sympathies. It is only
through such that you can establish a true community with the material
world of which you form a part. Accept human loveaccept a moral
representative of myselfbelieve in the possibility of its chasteness
as well as utility, and you will yet be strong, powerful of good, and
happy.
