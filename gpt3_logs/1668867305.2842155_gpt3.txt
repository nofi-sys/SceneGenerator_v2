SCENE:
I am a Yank; and you?

I am Julian 20th, The Red Hawk, I replied.

He raised his brows. I have heard of you in the past few days, he
said. Your people are fighting mightily at the edge of The Capital; but
they will be driven backthe Kalkars are too many. Raban will be glad
of you if the stories they tell of him are true. One is that he eats the
hearts of brave warriors that fall into his hands.

I smiled. What is the creature? I asked again. Where originates such
a breed?

He is only a Kalkar, replied Okonnor; but even a greater monstrosity
than his fellows. He was born in The Capital, of ordinary Kalkar
parents, they say, and early developed a lust for blood that has
increased with the passing years. He boasts yet of his first murderhe
killed his mother when he was ten.

I shuddered. And it is into the hands of such that a daughter of the
Or-tis has fallen, I said, and you, an American, aided in her
capture.

He looked at me in startled surprise. The daughter of an Or-tis? he
cried.

Of _the_ Or-tis, I repeated.

I did not know, he said. I was not close to her at any time and
thought that she was but a Kalkar woman.

What are you going to do? Can you save her?

He drew his knife and cut the bonds that held my arms behind me. Hide
here among the trees, he said, and watch the Raban until I return. It
will be after dark, but I will bring help. This valley is almost
exclusively peopled by those who have refused to intermarry with the
Kalkars and have brought down their strain unsullied from ancient times.
There are almost a thousand fighting men of pure Yank blood within its
confines. I should be able to gather enough to put an end to Raban for
all time, and if the danger of a daughter of Or-tis cannot move them
from their shame and cowardice they are hopeless indeed.

He mounted his horse. Quick! he cried, get among the trees.

Where is my horse? I called as he was riding away. He was not
killed?

No, he called back; he ran off when you fell. We did not try to catch
him. A moment later he disappeared around the west end of the hill and
I entered the miniature forest that clothed it. Through the gloom of my
sorrow broke one ray of happinessRed Lightning lived.

About me grew ancient trees of enormous size with boles five or six feet
in diameter and their upper foliage waving a hundred and more feet above
my head. Their branches excluded the sun where they grew thickest and
beneath them baby trees struggled for existence in the wan light, or
hoary monsters, long fallen, lay embedded in leaf mold, marking the spot
where some long dead ancient set out a tiny seedling that was to outlive
all his kind.

It was a wonderful place in which to hide, though hiding is an
accomplishment that we Julians have little training in and less stomach
for. However, in this instance it was in a worthy causea Julian hiding
from a Kalkar in the hope of aiding an Or-tis! Ghosts of nineteen
Julians! To what had I brought my proud name? And yet I could not be
ashamed. There was something stubbornly waging war against all my
inherited scruples, and I knew that it was going to winhad already
won. I would have sold my soul for this daughter of my enemy.

I made my way up the hill toward the ruined tent, but at the summit the
shrubbery was so dense that I could see nothing. Rose bushes fifteen
feet high and growing as thickly together as a wall hid everything from
my sight. I could not even penetrate them. Near me was a mighty tree
with a strange, feathery foliage. It was such a tree as I had never seen
before, but that fact did not interest me so much as the discovery that
it might be climbed to a point that would permit me to see above the top
of the rose bushes.

What I saw included two stone tents not so badly ruined as most of those
one comes across, and between them a pool of wateran artificial pool
of straight lines. Some fallen columns of stone lay about it and the
vines and creepers fell over its edge into the water, almost concealing
the stone rim. As I watched, a group of men came from the ruin to the
east through a great archway, the coping of which had fallen away. They
were all Kalkars and among them was Raban. I had my first opportunity to
view him closely. He was a most repulsive appearing creature. His great
size might easily have struck with awe the boldest heart, for he stood a
full nine feet in height and was very large in proportion about the
shoulders, chest and limbs. His forehead was so retreating that one
might with truth say he had none, his thick thatch of stiffly erect hair
almost meeting his shaggy eyebrows. His eyes were small and set close to
a coarse nose and all his countenance was bestial. I had not dreamed
that a mans face could be so repulsive.
