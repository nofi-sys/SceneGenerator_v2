SCENE:

DUD LOSES HIS TEMPER


Winter, observed Jimmy very disgustedly one morning toward the last
of February, is sure lingering in the lap of spring, as the poet
hath it. Between you and me, Dud, I guess winters fallen asleep there!
Here it is almost March and everythings still covered up with snow or
ice. Or water, he added a second later, his gaze falling to the pools
of melting snow that lay in the hollows of the campus.

The windows were wide open and the air that came in, while chill and
damp, still, somehow, held a suggestionor perhaps a faint promiseof
spring. But the sky was leaden, between the walks the sod was hidden
under patches of dirty snow or ice that had begun to melt a little and
the whole morning world had a tired and bedraggled look. Jimmy, still
attired in pajamas, shivered and turned disapprovingly away. Then his
gaze fell on Dud and the disapproval increased, for Dud, half awake a
moment before, had nestled down on the rumpled pillow again and was
sleeping peacefully. Jimmy was righteously indignant.

Wake up, you sluggard! he bawled, pulling the clothes from the other.
Here Ive been talking to you for five minutes, saying perfectly
gorgeous things, and you havent heard a word! Get up, you lazy loafer,
and hear the birdies singor sneeze! Come out of there!

Dud came out, rather in a heap, blinking confusedly, and strove to pull
the clothes from the bed to his shrinking form on the floor. But Jimmy
was merciless, and Dud was forced to arise grumblingly and rub his
sleepy eyes.

Whwhat time is it? he yawned.

Never mind what time it is, replied Jimmy severely. Its time you
were up and doing

With a heart for any fate, murmured Dud poetically if sleepily.
What day is it?

Great Jumpin Jehosophat! exclaimed Jimmy. He doesnt even know
the date! Its a Tuesday, darling, and the months February, and the
year

Then its today practice begins, said Dud. I knew there was
something. He arose and sought his bath robe. Ill bet its awfully
early. I dont hear anyone up.

You hear me up, responded his roommate. As a matter of fact, I dont
know just what time it is, because you forgot to wind the clock and my
watch has stopped and I couldnt find yours. But it must be long after
six

Six! grunted Dud in deep disgust. What do you go pulling me out of
bed at six for? Im going back again!

I said it was long after six. Wheres your watch? Have a look at it.

Dud discovered that article at last dangling over the back of a chair,
it having escaped from a pocket, and in more mollified tones informed
Jimmy that it was twenty to seven. In the corridor a door opened and
slippered feet pattered toward the bathroom. Jimmy set his watch and
the clock, found his own robe and then, pausing at the door, asked
solicitously:

Hows the old arm, Dud?

Sore, was the answer. Dud bent it and flexed itit was his right
oneand observed it scowlingly. Its lame all the way to the
shoulder. _Ouch!_ And the shoulders lame, too!

Too bad, said Jimmy. I was afraid you might overdo it, Dud.

Well, whose silly idea was it, anyway? demanded Dud indignantly. Who
suggested practicing every day, Id just like to know?

I did, of course, but I didnt tell you to do too much of it and lame
yourself, did I? What youve gone and done, Dud, is catch cold in it.
You ought to be mighty careful that way. You ought

Oh, dry up, grumbled Dud. You make me tired. If you know so pesky
much about it, why didnt you say something before? I wouldnt have
caught cold in it if you hadnt insisted on slopping around in that
rink yesterday with the water up to your ankles! No wonder I caught
cold!

Well, youll have to lay off a few days, old chap. Itll be all right
again, I guess.

Thats fine, isnt it, when Ive got to report for practice this
afternoon?
