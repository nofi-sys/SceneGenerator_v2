SCENE:
XXV

Meet the Wife


Into the ranch yard of the X Bar X rode ten men--ten tired, dusty,
but triumphant men. Their job had been done. Every Durham had been
driven all the way from Whirlpool River Ranch to their own range,
and once more safely enclosed within their own fences. The long
journey was completed. They were home again.

The whole ranch turned out to welcome them. Mrs. Manley, her eyes
shining with happiness, walked down the steps of the porch. A moment
later the front door opened again, and Belle Ada, Ethel and Nell
came rushing out.

Hello, Dad! Belle called shrilly. Hello, Roy! Climb down off that
bronco and give your sister a kiss, Teddy!

Ill think it over, Teddy laughed, and slid off his pony. Hello,
Mother! Back again as good as new!

Ethel Carew and Nell Willis were frankly delighted to see the boys
again. They demanded the story of the trip with complete details,
as Ethel said, and sat with wide-eyed fascination as the story was
related.

Teddy insisted on telling of Roys fight with the eagle, though he
had not seen it, because he said Roy was too modest. It lost none
of its excitement by his recital.

Mrs. Manley was anxious to learn if any one was injured, but her
husband, with a wink at the boys, asked her if she ever heard of any
one getting hurt at a picnic.

Of course, sometimes they fall into the brook an get wet, he
added, with a grin, so Teddy an Roy had to do that, too. But were
all home now, an hungry. Think we can stop this gab-fest long
enough to eat?

It was then three oclock in the afternoon, so Mrs. Manley decided
to have an early supper. She went to help Mrs. Moore, the
housekeeper, and her daughter Norine prepare the meal, while Teddy
and Roy continued the tale of their adventures at the urgent request
of Nell and of Curly.

By five oclock all was in readiness for the adventurers first meal
since their arrival home. When they entered the long dining room,
they saw that the table had been enlarged by the addition of many
leaves and that there were places set for every one of the punchers.

Celebration, Mrs. Manley said, as she smiled. Teddy, go and tell
the boys to come in. And dont forget Sing Lung. We want everybody!
Tell every man on the place to come!

You bet I will, Mom! Teddy shouted, and made for the door. In a
few minutes he was back, followed by a crowd of grinning, jostling
cowboys. Jules Kolto had recovered sufficiently to return with them,
and he, of course, was included in the invitation, although he
protested that he wasnt fit to eat with honest folks.

Pop Burns was there, with his shoulder conspicuously bandaged. He
was accorded the place of honor--next to the boss. Sing Lung,
chatting like a parrot, was placed near Jules. Teddy and Roy sat on
either side of their mother, while Belle, Ethel, and Nell were
distributed about to keep the boys from scrappin over the
chicken, Mr. Manley laughingly insisted.

The punchers were a bit bashful at first to be eating in the big
house, but this soon wore off. There are few punchers who stay
bashful in the presence of roast chicken and cranberry sauce. There
was but one fly in the ointment. Gus Tripp was not there. Holding in
his hand a glass of water, Mr. Manley arose.

Boys, he said, I want to propose a toast--that right, Mother?--I
want to propose a toast to an absent member. Fellers, heres to Gus
Tripp--may he some day come back to us!

Nick Looker, who was sitting next to Teddy, jumped to his feet.

Wait, boss! he exclaimed. Dont drink it yet! I been waitin fer
this! Hang on to yore seats a minute! and he ran out of the door
toward the yard. Roy and Teddy looked at each other with surprised
faces. What was Nick up to, for Petes sake?

They saw in a moment. The door flew open, and on the threshold stood
Gus, not alone, but holding by the hand a blushing girl!

Boss, he said, meet the wife!
