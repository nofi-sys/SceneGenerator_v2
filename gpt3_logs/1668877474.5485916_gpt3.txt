SCENE:
XXXIV

ELIZABETH GIVES ADVICE


IVE seen the interloper, said Elizabeth.

She was walking with John by the river. He had called for her at the
Green Man, and had proposed a walk.

Yes? said John. There was enquiry in his tone.

He isnt, said Elizabeth, in the remotest degree what I imagined
him, except for his size. He--well, it is extraordinarily difficult to
describe him.

You feel that?

Theres something so childlike about him, pursued Elizabeth. If I
were to attempt to put into words what I mean, he seems to me like a
child, who had started out to get something, entirely sure that he
wanted it; and then, when he found it in his grasp, he discovered it to
be totally different from what he imagined it. He expected a sort of
toy, and he has found an enormous responsibility. He doesnt know what
to make of it. He is utterly perplexed, and it hasnt occurred to him
that the simplest plan would be to renounce it.

John opened eyes of wonder.

I always knew you were shrewd, my dear Elizabeth, he remarked, but
how you have arrived at these conclusions in so brief a space of time,
beats me altogether.

Then you think Im right? she demanded.

I am pretty sure of it. But the thing is, that he sees the
responsibility without exactly recognizing it, and, as you say, the
simple way out of the difficulty hasnt occurred to him in consequence.

Elizabeth mused, looking at the running water.

But thats not all, she went on. Theres more I cant fathom. These
are merely material difficulties to grapple with. He is faced with
something deeper. You can call me absurd if you like. I daresay I am
being a little _exalt_, but he has a look in his eyes as if he had
caught a glimpse of the Vision Beautiful, and he is a bit bewildered.

Oh, no, said John quietly, Ill not call you absurd.

Elizabeth cast a quick look at him and lapsed into silence. The second
problem was already absorbing her vastly more than the first. It was
infinitely greater, the issue infinitely more important. To the first
problem, when David had once grasped it fairly, there was so simple a
solution, did he but choose to take it. In any case, however, it was,
to her mind, on another plane. It didnt belong to the same category
as this second problem. Of course you may say that the mental problem
existed solely in Elizabeths imagination. But then she did not think
it did; nor, you will realize, did John.

Suddenly she spoke again, and quite irrelevantly to her former remarks.

What particular interest has--Sir David, I suppose I must call him, in
dress clothes?

Dress clothes? queried John bewildered.

Dress clothes, reiterated Elizabeth. I happened to say--quite idly,
you understand,--that youd sooner go without your dinner than not
dress for it. He asked me if I meant that, and when I replied that I
did, I saw at once that, far from being the little trivial matter I had
believed it, it was, to him, of the most vital and grave importance.

Oh, my dear Elizabeth! Johns eyebrows went up. He gazed at his
sister in comical dismay.

Well? demanded Elizabeth. You would.

Oh, I daresay, said John ruefully. But--well, the man hasnt a dress
suit. Apparently he doesnt possess such a thing, and Father Maloney
swore that it was an entirely unnecessary article in the country.
Corin and I dined at Delancey Castle in morning dress to keep him in
countenance. And now you-- he broke off.

Contrition, profound and utter contrition, wrote itself on Elizabeths
face.

I ought to have guessed there was something momentous in the
question, she said remorsefully, and yet how could I! How small I
must have made him feel!
