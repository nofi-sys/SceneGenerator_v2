SCENE:
He rested an oar against his knee and drew out the package. Ive still
got it, he said. Otto Mononsonburg left it in a safe placefor a
German. There were three doors to take before this package could be
gained.

He glanced up into her eyes. To him they had hardened, despite her
weariness. There was an eagerness there he did not like. Calculation had
been foreign to her in the old days.

Replacing the packet and taking up the oar, he said:

Youve changed, Saidee. If I thought you were going to double-cross me,
Id sink this boat. Your heart, your mind, your soul is in getting the
package. What does it mean to you?

She bit her lip and granted him a wan smile. It doesnt mean so much to
me, Chester, as it does to others. You really dont know what you have
done tonight. You dont know!

Fay swung at the oars and tried to sight the shore of the canal. He
sheered the boat and started rowing vigorously.

Between strokes he said:

Come out with the truth, Saidee. Remember the old days. What have you
been doing since then? How did you happen to get mixed up with the Yard?
Dont you know you cant trust the police?

Your viewpoint will change, Chester.

Never!

Yesit will. It will if I ask you to change it.

He was silent at this. He rowed on until the bow of the boat struck a
sunken pier close to the shore. He rose, braced his knees against a
gunwale and glanced upward. A rotting quay was close at hand. There was
a ladder coming down from this quay. He reached, waited, then grasped a
rung of the ladder. The boat steadied as he drew it alongside the pier.

Ill go up first, he said. You hand me the bags and then come up.
Push the boat away when you get on the ladder. Push it hard, so itll
float a long way before the police find it.

He saw her nod her head. He climbed upward, being careful to avoid the
broken rungs of the ladder. He turned at the top and reached down to
her. She passed up the two bags which he took and laid on the edge of
the pier. Her hand grasped his extended fingers. She thrust out the boat
as she leaped the gap and trusted herself to him. They stood in the
gloom at the brink of the dark canal.

All clear, he said, after listening. There goes the boat out toward
the sea. Well hurry inland and find a quiet spot. Youre damp. The
feathers of your hat look like Avenue A.

She drew her jacket about her breast. Her eyes were bright as she turned
and pointed toward the two bags.

Carry them, she said. Lead and Ill follow. Its almost dawn.

Well find a dry spot, said he, lifting the bags and starting over the
quay. Well lay low till noon, then well figure out the best get-away
from Holland. I think the railroads will be watched.

I could carry the package to London without being suspected.

He squared his shoulders and walked on. His hands gripped the bags with
white strength. She realized that she had not gained his confidence in
the matter of the cipher-key. Her feet dragged. She glanced back now and
then.

He came, after taking a long detour, to another canal which roughly
paralleled the one they had crossed. There was a tiny wooded isle in the
center of this canal. A narrow bridge of planks stretched from the shore
to the island.

A summer place, he said. Thatll do, Saidee.

She held her hand up toward the sky. A mist was falling. An opal vapor
was beyond this mist. The world seemed wrapped in a great yellow
blanket.

Beastly morning, he said as he dropped the bags to his feet. Suppose
they could follow us to here?

I dont know. I wish the sun would come out. Im soaked.

Come on, he said, lifting the bags and starting over the plank bridge.
Well pull one of these up and then well be safe for a time. Where are
we?
