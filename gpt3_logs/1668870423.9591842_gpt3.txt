SCENE:
XVIII

FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER


"Let 'em alone, Amy!" begged Jessie, from the bow. "You are only
twisting the boat's head around and making it harder for Nell to row."

"I--could--do better--if the rudder was unshipped," declared Nell,
pantingly.

Immediately Amy jerked the heavy rudder out of its sockets. Fortunately
she had got the lines over her head before doing this, or she might
have been carried overboard.

For the rudder was too much for Amy. The rising waves tore it out of
her hands the instant it was loose, and away it went on a voyage of its
own.

"There!" exclaimed Jessie, with exasperation. "What do you suppose that
grouchy old man will say when we bring him back his boat without the
rudder?"

"He won't say so much as he would if we didn't bring him back his boat
at all," declared Amy. "I'll pay for the rudder."

Jessie felt that the situation was far too serious for Amy to speak
so carelessly. She urged Nell to let her help with the oars; and, in
truth, the other found handling the two oars with the rising waves
cuffing them to and fro rather more than she had bargained for.

Jessie shipped the starboard oar in the bow and together she and Nell
did their very best. But the wind swooped down upon them, tearing the
tops from the waves and saturating the three girls with spray.

"I guess I know what that white-haired boy tried to tell us," gasped
Amy, from the stern. "He must have seen this thunderstorm coming."

"All the other boats got ashore," panted Nell. "We were foolish not to
see."

"Nobody on lookout--that's it!" groaned Amy. "Oh!"

A streak of lightning seemed to cross the sky, and the thunder followed
almost instantly. Down came the rain--tempestuously. It drove over the
water, flattening the waves for a little, then making the sea boil.

"Hurry up, girls!" wailed Amy. "Get ashore--do! I'm sopping wet."

Jessie and Nell had no breath with which to reply to her. They were
pulling at the top of their strength. The shore was not far away in
reality. But it seemed a long way to pull with those heavy oars.

The rain swept landward and drove everybody, even the few bathers, to
cover. The shallow water was torn again into whitecaps and a lot of
spray came inboard as Jessie and Nell tried their very best to reach
the strand.

Amy could do nothing but encourage them. There was no way by which she
might aid their escape from the tempest. One thing, she did nothing to
hinder! Even she was in no mood for "making fun."

In fact, this tempest was an experience such as none of the three girls
had seen before. Jessie and Nell were well-nigh breathless and their
arms and shoulders began to ache.

"Let me exchange with one of you, Nell! Jess!" cried Amy, her voice
half drowned by the noise of wind and rain.

"Stay where you are!" commanded Jessie, from the bow, as her chum
started to come forward. "You might tip us over!"

"Sit down!" sang the cheerful Nell. "Sit down, you're rocking the boat!"

"But I want to help!" complained Amy.

"You did your helping when you got rid of that rudder," returned Nell,
comfortingly. "Do be still, Amy Drew!"

"How can one be still in such a jerky, pitching boat?" gasped the other
girl. "Do--do you think you can reach land, Jessie Norwood?"

"I've hopes of it," responded her chum. "It isn't very far."

"I wonder how far it is to--to land underneath the keel?" sputtered Amy.

"For pity's sake stop that!" cried Nell Stanley. "Don't suggest such
gloomy and gruesome things."

"Well," grumbled Amy, "I believe it's the nearest land."
