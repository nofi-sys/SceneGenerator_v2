SCENE:
II.


Jenny looked, if possible, lovelier than usual as she tripped
downstairs beside her mother and her aunt. Her face was still flushed
from sleep, and her hair had been twisted up anyhow, whilst the pale
blue gown she wore accorded well with her rose-leaf complexion. Mrs
Crampton and Miss Bostock accompanied her in trembling dread of the
coming encounter, but the girl herself was perfectly confident and
fearless. As they reached the door of the library, where her father
awaited her, she caught sight of Aunt Clems visage and burst out
laughing.

Oh, dear! she cried, Aunt Clem, if you dont put on some other kind
of face, youll kill me! When you assume that lugubrious expression,
you look so like a cow that I always expect to hear you low.

Dearest child! that is not kind, remarked her mother, with mild
reproof.

Oh! never mind, it doesnt signify, I am sure dear Jenny doesnt mean
it, interposed Aunt Clem, who had, nevertheless, winced under the
sarcasm.

I did mean it, though, cried Jenny boldly; one would think I was
going to be hanged to see your long faces. Well, papa! she continued,
as they entered the presence of Mr Crampton, and what may you have
to say to me this morning? Youll have to pay for dragging me out of
my bed in this outrageous manner, you know, and I shant be pacified
until you buy me that little Arab mare of Mr Winchers. Is it a
bargain?

She looked so saucy and so pretty as she said this, and perched herself
on her fathers knee, that Mr Crampton, in his pride and affection,
was very nearly granting her request without further protest. But
the remembrance of the Popish admirer intruded itself just in time to
prevent the folly. Nevertheless, he kissed his daughters blooming
cheek, and said,--

If you will be a good girl, and do exactly as I tell you, you shall
have a dozen Arab mares if they will please you, Jenny.

All right, old gentleman! thats a bargain. Now for the conditions.

But we must speak seriously, my dear, for I am quite in earnest in
this matter. You have been encouraging a young man to come about here,
Jenny, of whose acquaintanceship you know I do not approve--I mean Mr
Frederick Walcheren. Now, I must have a stop put to it at once. He
never comes here again, nor will I allow you to meet him out of the
house, unless it should be by accident, nor to dance with him if you do
meet him. I hope you understand me plainly. I will not permit you to
know any of the Walcherens from this time forward. You must entirely
drop them. Nor shall your mother ask them to my house. And I shall
never remove this prohibition from you--_never_!

Anything more? asked Jenny, shortly.

A close observer might have seen and interpreted the change in her
countenance as she listened to her fathers mandate. Into the light
hazel eyes had crept a much darker shade, and the full lips had pouted
till they had become sullen. But all she said was Anything more?

I do not know that, as your father, I am in any way called upon to
give you my reasons, my dear, but, since you seem to ask for them,
I will. You appear to me to have shown a marked preference for Mr
Frederick Walcherens society, and, as it would be impossible for you
to marry him, it is best the affair should be put an end to at once.

He has plenty of money, argued the young lady.

I am aware of that, and the uses he has hitherto put his money to. He
is a gambler and a loose liver. But that is not the chief objection
to him in my eyes. His vices might be reformed, but not his religion.
Young creatures like yourself do not think of such things, but the
Walcherens are all Roman Catholics, and that fact puts an insuperable
barrier between them and us. I would never, under any circumstances,
give my consent to your marriage with a Papist. I would rather see you
in your grave, Jenny, and I cannot say more than that. If you have
entertained any such idea, you must dismiss it from your mind at once.
And in order that there may be no fear of such a thing--in order to
secure your happiness and safety, I insist upon your giving up the
acquaintanceship of this young man altogether. You must not ask him to
the house again, and, if he calls, your mother will order the servant
to say that she is not at home. If you meet him out, you have my
strict commands not to dance with him, or to talk more than the merest
politeness necessitates. If, notwithstanding these precautions, I find
Mr Walcheren is obstinately bent on thrusting himself where he is not
welcome, I shall take the law into my own hands, by carrying you away
from Hampstead to some place where it is impossible you can meet him.
Dont think me harsh, Jenny, for, God knows, that is the last thing
I wish to be towards you, but I have spoken to you on this subject
several times before, and I find you have taken no heed, so you force
me to speak more plainly. Do you quite understand me now?
