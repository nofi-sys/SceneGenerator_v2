SCENE:
Oh, oh! Laura shrieked suddenly. This place is full of fish. One
just passed me! Oh, theres another! And another!

But by this time both the other girls were jumping and screaming
with their excitement; for fish were darting about them everywhere.
The boys, not at all nervous of course and very much excited, were
trying to drive the fish into corners to find out what they were. Zeke
identified them all easily enough--cod, sculpins, flounders, and perch.

Whats that big thing? Arthur exclaimed suddenly. Jiminy
_crickets_! he called excitedly. Its the biggest turtle I ever laid
my eyes on.

The girls shrieked and stayed exactly where they were, clinging
together. But the males all ran in Arthurs direction.

Dats some turtle, believe muh, commented Zeke.

Im going to take it home, Arthur declared, and put it in the Magic
Mirror.

The Magic Mirror! Laura echoed. Why I would never dare go in
swimming if I knew that huge thing was there.

Well keep it tied up with a rope, Arthur went on excitedly. It
cant get where we go in swimming because the rope wont be long
enough. Come on, fellows, help me get it.

How are you going to catch it? Harold demanded.

Lasso it! Arthur declared, untying a stout rope which hung from one
end of the weir posts.

The prospect of catching such big game was too tempting for the males
of the party. And so while the girls dashed madly about, trying to get
out of their reach, screaming with excitement and holding on to each
other for protection, but really enjoying the situation very much--the
boys chased the turtle from corner to corner, until finally Arthur
managed to lasso a leathery paw and tie it captive to a weir post. How
he did this, he himself found it hard to say, because the water was
lashed to a miniature fury by the flounderings of both the turtle and
its captors. It was probably pure accident, he was humble enough to
assert. But having caught the creature, they were not content until
they had brought him ashore, and so the procession started beachwards,
Arthur pulling the turtle at the end of the rope.

It was a huge turtle at least two feet in diameter. It had wide
leathery flappers, a wicked looking head--as big, Rosie said, as her
alarm clock. But its shell was beautifully marked.

As they approached the beach they could see the great square of the
tablecloth laid out on the sand and Floribel busy piling up sandwiches
and hard-boiled eggs; fruit and cake. The Little Six came running to
meet them and then it became a problem to keep them out of the way
of the turtles snapping jaws. They had no difficulty however, with
Floribel, who screamed with terror at the sight of the strange creature
and would not allow them to bring it onto the beach. They ended by
mooring it, by means of a large rock, in one of the pools near the
shore.

Then, forgetting their prey for a while, they sat down to lunch. They
were ready to do full justice to it.

Lord_ee_! Floribel exclaimed once. Deyse salt enough here for an
army--shuah! Who put all dat salt in the basket?

The three girls burst into giggles.

I was so sure wed forget the salt, Maida said, that I put in a pair
of salt-cellars.

I put in three, declared Rosie.

And I put in four, confessed Laura.

After lunch, following the orders which Mrs. Dore had given them, they
sat on the beach for an hour before they went in bathing again. This
prolonged itself to much more than an hour because they began making
the inevitable collections of shells and stones to take home. Floribel
said that moon-stones were sometimes found on this beach and there
instantly began a frantic search for the small, translucent white
stones. Of course everybody found several of what he supposed were
invaluable gems. By this time the tide, which had turned just as they
left the fish weir, was now galloping up on the beach in great waves.
They had to pull the turtle farther and farther in shore. At length
they all went in bathing again; the Big Six diving through the waves
and occasionally getting boiled--which was the local term for being
whirled about--for their pains. Floribel permitted the Little Six to
play only in the rush of the waves after they broke.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The Big Six and the Little Six are swimming in the ocean when they come across a huge turtle. They manage to catch it and tie it up, but it's too big to take home so they leave it in a pool near the shore. They then have a picnic lunch on the beach before going back in for a swim.
