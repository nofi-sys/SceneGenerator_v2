SCENE:
XI


When Topham left Miss Byrd he went back to the American embassy. The
hour was late and the windows were all dark and the rooms seemed
deserted, and despite Rutiles invitation for a moment Topham hesitated
to climb the stairs.

Finally he stepped to the entrance, intending to ask the
watchman-porter there whether the secretary had gone. To his
surprise--though not so greatly so as it would have been if he had
known German customs better--the door was ajar and the watchman
missing; so with a shrug of his shoulders he entered and climbed the
stairs.

A tap at the embassy offices brought immediate answer, and he opened
the door just as Rutile came to meet him.

Come in, old man, called the latter. Ive been sitting in the
moonlight thinking something out. I often do when Ive got something
important on hand. Come and sit down and Ill light up and well have a
drink.

Topham took the proffered chair, but declined the drink. Not tonight,
thank you! he decided. And dont light up for me. I like moonlight.
Queer about the moon, though. It affects most people the other way,
doesnt it.

Maybe! But not me! Im rather excitable, you know. Liable to get
worked up over things and to exaggerate their importance. When I
suspect Im doing that, I sit down in the moonlight--if theres a moon
handy--and in the stillness--if stillness is to be had--and think it
all over. Thats what Ive been doing tonight.

And did it soothe you?

Rutile shook his head, doubtfully. Im not certain, he admitted. You
navy people have the best of it, after all. You havent got to agitate
your supposed brains. All youve got to do is to fight, and if you get
a chance to distinguish yourself the whole country knows it and the
Sunday newspapers call you heroes and clamor for your promotion. We
diplomats, on the other hand, are valuable in the inverse ratio that we
make it known.

Yes? remarked Topham, languidly.

Yes! Of course! returned Rutile, impatiently. We diplomats are the
real defenders of the peace. Suppose we had a war! All you fellows
could do would be to whip the enemy and if you did it you would get
medals and prize money and things. But Ive prevented at least one
war and nobody knows anything about it except the last administration
at Washington and if theres any deader tomb for a mans achievements
than the last administration, I dont know where it is--unless its the
administration before the last.

Topham fidgeted. He was not very apt at speech. What war did you
prevent? he asked, at last, seeing that Rutile expected him to say
something.

Oh! None of any special consequence, returned the other
sarcastically, Just a little bit of a war--one between Germany and the
United States.

Youre joking, arent you?

Never less so. His Majesty Wilhelm was working to grab southern
Brazil two or three years ago and I checkmated him; knocked his plans
sky-high. If I hadnt wed have had to fight him or abandon the Monroe
Doctrine. And just because I did it so quietly nobody knew anything
about it, bright young men like you want to know whether I am serious;
even the Ambassador has his doubts on the subject.

Topham was not listening. Rutiles mention of Brazil had given him the
opening he desired.

That reminds me, he said, awkwardly, What do you think of Count Ouro
Preto and his sister? Risdon was speaking of them this morning, you
know. Theyre Brazilians, arent they?

Rutile swallowed. It is not altogether pleasant to be checked so
abruptly when talking about ones self. Then he laughed.

Youre the directest ever! he remarked. Why didnt you tell me you
wanted to know about the Countess Elsa, and save me telling you a lot
of stuff you didnt listen to? I suppose you have found out that it was
she who crossed with you?

Topham stared. Yes! he said. Risdon pointed her out on the street
this morning and I recognized her. How did you guess?


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Rutile and to provide some background information on the Countess Elsa. Rutile comes across as a boastful, self-important man who is not to be taken seriously. The reader also learns that the Countess Elsa is a Brazilian who was on the same ship as Topham.
