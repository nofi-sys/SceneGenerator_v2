SCENE:
WHEN Anne went up to her room she took a seat by the window where she
could see the channel. It was an undecipherable blackness, its farther
limit defined by the shore lights. But the night was very still, the
sagging weight of cloud hung low pressing down sounds. She could hear
the barking of dogs, the cries of children, a snatch of song from
the mainland. In this intense quiet the first explosive throbs of a
starting launch would be carried clearly across the sounding board of
the water.

She kept telling herself that Rawsons absence had nothing to do with
Joe. She had been telling herself the same thing ever since Williams
remark at supper. She gave her reasons for thinking so, as if she
were trying to convince an adversary who was maintaining an opposing
position. It was as Shine had said, Rawson had gone on some business
they knew nothing of. There must be endless business connected with
such a case. She remembered murder cases she had read of in the
papers--accounts of false leads, trails picked up and dropped, legal
questions of state and county authority.

Then across the water, running along the surface in stuttering
reverberations, came the sound of the launchs engine starting.
She saw the light leave the shore and come sliding forward, moving
smoothly like a light held in a steady hand. Below it a golden dagger
stabbed down into the glossy blackness of the current. She watched it
approaching, the inside of her mouth like leather, her clenched hands
wet.

When it had disappeared round the end of the house she faced the door
and stood waiting. Her power to argue with herself was gone--if he had
found out anything he might come for her. She calculated his movements:
in the library now, talking with the others. A long time seemed to
pass. The stifling pulsations of her heart died down, and moving with
an exquisite quietness as if any sound she made might bridge the space
and call them running to surprise her guilty terror, she stole to the
door and opened it a crack. The living-room was lighted but empty; they
were in the library, shut in. Again a time passed and again her heart
calmed to a slower beat. It must be business, the business that had
nothing to do with Joe.

She closed the door and decided now she might rest, not go to bed yet,
but lie down and try to get back to courage and control. She took off
her dress and put on her neglige, and with hands raised to loosen her
hair heard a step on the stairs. It struck upon her ear, heavy and
quick, a mans step, and she remained as she was, her arms lifted, her
eyes staring into her reflected eyes in the mirror. She stood thus till
it stopped at her door. When the knock came and Rawsons voice spoke
her name, the hands dropped and she moved to the door.

Can you come down-stairs for a minute? the voice said, low and
guarded. Im sorry to ask you to get up.

She opened the door. I hadnt gone to bed. Yes, of course Ill come.
You want to----

Just ask you a few more questions. Im glad I didnt wake you.

She followed him along the passage and down the stairs. They crossed
the living-room side by side, Rawson with long strides, she with short
quick steps. There was a sense of hurry in their progress as if they
were hastening to some ominous goal. When she entered the library her
glance fell on Bassett facing her across the room, his brows drawn
low over the dark trouble of his eyes. His look told her of anxiety,
apprehension and a passionate concern for her. She gave it back,
feeling a desperate cold courage run to her fainting senses.

Williams indicated an armchair near the desk:

Take a seat, Miss Tracy. Sorry weve had to call you down.

She fell into it and, as the men settled themselves in theirs, ran her
tongue along her dry lips and took a deep breath of air into her lungs.
Then she raised her chin and looked at them, inquiringly attentive.
During the passage of the look she laid the charge on her mind to go
cautiously and not be afraid.

Weve been making some inquiries about your brother, Miss Tracy,
Rawson began. About his leaving here. You told us, as I remember, that
you knew he went.

Why, yes, he went.

Did you see him go?

Well, no, I didnt actually _see_ him, but that wouldnt prevent--
She stopped and looked from one to the other of the watching
faces--What do you mean?

She must find out what they knew before she ventured.

Then you _didnt_ see him?
