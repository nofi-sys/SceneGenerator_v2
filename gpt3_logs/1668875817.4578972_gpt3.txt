SCENE:
XVI


After Lillian Byrd and Topham had left Berlin, their relative
importance in Rutiles eyes underwent a gradual change. Anxious at
first to hear from Miss Byrd chiefly because he hoped she might be able
to discover something that might aid him to rescue his friend from
what he felt sure was a dangerous entanglement, he soon became anxious
to hear from her for her own sake. Therefore, he eagerly welcomed the
letters she wrote him even before she left for Brazil, and he spent
much time and used up much midnight oil in preparing answers.

Both the Ouro Pretos had left Berlin and with their departure, the
possible political aspect of the affair was relegated to the back
of his mind, especially as he could get no information concerning
their interview with the Emperor. The question of restoring the duchy
seemed to have entirely dropped out of sight, the general impression
prevailing that the Emperor had denied the request and that the
discomfited claimants had gone back to Brazil. And the murdered robber
had been forgotten!

The whole affair was brought sharply back to Rutiles mind, however, by
the contents of a letter he received from Miss Byrd about three months
after she had left England.

After the usual preliminaries, the letter proceeded:

I know you must think I have been neglectful of your request to
investigate the Ouro Pretos; but I have not really been so. The
information you wanted was not altogether easy to obtain; and in
getting it I chanced on some things that roused keen interest in me as
a newspaper woman.

You have, of course, heard of the rebellion that has broken out in the
southern provinces of Brazil, but I doubt whether you have any accurate
information as to its real strength. The Government naturally minimizes
it. But it is really very serious.

Briefly, it is organized and maintained chiefly by the 1,000,000
German immigrants, who form two-thirds of the population of the three
southern provinces. With these are a few excitable Brazilians of the
class that is always agin the government, partly because they hope to
gain something for themselves by success and partly because they are
naturally prone to fly off the handle.

The revolution has two prominent leaders; the Count of Ouro Preto, and
his son. In Berlin we somehow got an idea that the old man was dead,
but he isnt. He is very much alive! It is his wife, the daughter of
the duke of Hochstein, through whom your friends claim the duchy, who
is dead.

The old count is all sorts of a man. Like Castro of Venezuela he was
a cattle-thief in early days--or so his enemies say--and graduated,
through a period of banditism, to political prominence and enormous
wealth. He has organized the rebellion and has it working like
clockwork.

You want to know, of course, whether this rebellion has any connection
with Germany and with the request of Ouro Preto to the Kaiser. I think
it has! So far as I can find out, there was no rumor of rebellion
among the Germans here till young Ouro Preto got back two months ago;
there was some discontent, of course, but not enough to account for an
outbreak. This fact, however, by itself amounts to little. Nor is the
prominence of the Ouro Pretos in the movement particularly significant,
although of course, it is cumulative. What is more important, however,
is that half a dozen German officers, whose names I will add at the end
of this letter, are here training and leading the rebels. You might
find out whether they are still carried on the rolls of the German
army, and if not, why not?

Another significant fact is that the rebels are being supplied with
munitions of war from Germany. At least three steamers recently arrived
from Hamburg loaded with all sorts of war materials. I know this to be
a fact. You know how strict the Germans are when they want to be and
how impossible it would be for three vessels to get away from German
ports on filibustering expeditions without the connivance of the
authorities. It would be interesting if you should be able to trace
those arms and should find out that they came from government stores,
wouldnt it?

Taken separately, you see these things prove nothing; taken together,
they indicate that something is up. Just what it is, I dont know. Do
you?

Being on the inside, so to speak, you may know why the Kaiser might
want to cause trouble in Brazil. I confess I cant see his object. And
I cant see what difference it makes to the United States--except as
a basis for a newspaper story, which, by the way, I have not written.
Theres self sacrifice for you.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

In her letter, Lillian Byrd informs Rutile that she has been investigating the Ouro Pretos at his request, and has uncovered some potentially significant information. She reports that a rebellion has broken out in southern Brazil, led by the Ouro Pretos and a few other excitable Brazilians. She also reports that the rebellion appears to be receiving support from Germany, in the form of training and supplies.
