SCENE:
Filled up, Schwartz? cried Jerry McGlory, poking his head in at the
doorway.

Gome in, Mr. McGlory; deres nod many aheat of you.

Jerry entered, greeted his acquaintances, and hung up his coat.

Goin to the wake? asked he of OHara.

Twuld be but daysint fer me till pay my rayspects till the family.
Are yez goin yezself?

Sure! Therell be a mob there, though. Then turning to the youth in
the scarlet tie he inquired: Well, what dye know, McGonagle?

Mr. McGonagle had just finished a graphic description, for the benefit
of his right-hand neighbour, of the last performance of a brass back
cock, the victorious veteran of a score of mains, and answered affably:

Nothin much. Ony the selectmans the sorest mug ye ever put yer
lamps on. If yed touch him wit a wet finger, hed sizzle.

Arrah, yer right, Goose, confirmed Burns. I stopped intill his place
for a sup av drink as I wur comin by, an from the talk av him yezd
tink young Murphy had put his hand intill his money drawer.

Divil mend him! said Clancy.

I heard, said McGlory, that Mary Carroll wasnt left a cent.

Dye tell me so? OHara was greatly interested.

Glory be! ejaculated Burns; an the nace so good till him.

Sure, Mary wurnt his nace, said Clancy.

Wur she not! Faix an thats news till me, so it is.

I heard me father say, said Jerry, that Marys grandfather put up
the coin to bring old man Murphy over here, and start him in the tea
biz. That was a good many moons ago; and when her folks lost all their
gilt and she was left alone, old Larry sent to Dublin for her, and hes
took care o her ever since.

Begorra, the owld fox had a heart in his body for all! Bud scure
till the wan av me iver give him credit for it. God save uz, resumed
Mr. Burns, after a pause, what a power av money he made at the tay
peddlin.

He uster be a great old geezer, didnt he? remarked McGonagle. I kin
remember him as plain as day in his old plug hat, an he wuz hot after
the needful, too.

There do be a good profit in tay, put in the grocer, who was now
sitting up, having his hair brushed; but how he iver made all av the
property hes left, be peddlin it from dure till dure, gits the better
av me.

He had a head for commerce, sure, put in OHara. It wur himself
that cud lay out a dollar till advantage; an divil the bate av him did
iver I see for buyin chape an sellin dear.

He was a winner if he cud beat youse at that game, OHara, laughed
McGlory.

Nexd! cried Schwartz, as Clancy got out of his chair. Malachi took
the vacated place, a frown wrinkling his brow. The grocer, thinking of
the hard bargain which OHara had driven when he had gone to him for
money, some time before, winked at Jerry, delighting in the cut; and
Schwartz, as he drew some hot water from the copper tank upon the stove
into OHaras shaving mug, grinned widely.

Dod vas a good von, Cherry, muttered he. You hid him hardt, aint
id?

Burns, who was gazing through the window, suddenly uttered an
exclamation, rushed into the street and buttonholed a young man who was
passing.

Is that not Dick Nolan, Jerry? asked Clancy tieing his four-in-hand
before the mirror over the wash-stand.

Yes, answered Jerry. I guess Tims hittin him for a job.

Be the powers! the crayture nades the bit av wurk. The good woife an
two childer mus find it hard; an Tims a study, sober felly.

In a few minutes Tim returned; his face had a brighter look and he was
lilting an old country air.
