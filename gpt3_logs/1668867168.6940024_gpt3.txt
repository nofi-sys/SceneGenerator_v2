Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
I looked about among my followers as we rode along. Jim was there, but
not FatherI never saw him again. He probably fell in the battle at the
new bridge. Orrin Colby, blacksmith and preacher, rode at my side
covered with bloodhis own and Kash Guard. Dennis Corrigan was there,
too.

We rode right into the barrack yard, for with their lack of discipline
and military efficiency they had sent their whole force against us with
the exception of a few men who remained to guard the prisoners and a
handful at headquarters building. The latter we overcame with scarce a
struggle and from one whom I took prisoner I learned where the sleeping
quarters of Or-tis were located.

Telling my men that our work was done I ordered them to scatter and
escape as best they might; but they said that they would remain with me.
I told them that the business I was on was such that I must handle it
alone and asked them to go and free the prisoners while I searched for
Juana. They said that they would wait for me outside and so we parted.

Or-tis quarters were on the second floor of the building in the east
wing and I had no difficulty in finding them. As I approached the door I
heard the sound of voices raised in anger within and of rapid movement
as though someone was running hither and thither across the floor. I
recognized Or-tis voicehe was swearing foully, and then I heard a
womans scream and I knew that it was Juana.

I tried the door and found it locked. It was a massive door, such as the
ancients built in their great public buildings, such as this had
originally been, and I doubted my ability to force it. I was mad with
apprehension and lust for revenge, and if maniacs gain tenfold in
strength when the madness is upon them, I must have been a maniac that
moment, for when, after stepping back a few feet, I hurled myself
against the door the shot bolt tore through the splintering frame and
the barrier swung in upon its hinges with a loud bang.

Before me, in the center of the room, stood Or-tis with Juana in his
clutches. He had her partially upon a table and with one hairy hand he
was choking her. He looked up at the noise of my sudden entry, and when
he saw me he went white and dropped Juana, at the same time whipping a
pistol from its holster at his side. Juana saw me too, and springing for
his arm dragged it down as he pulled the trigger, so that the bullet
went harmlessly into the floor.

Before he could shake her off I was upon him and had wrenched the weapon
from his grasp. I held him in one hand as one might a little childhe
was utterly helpless in my gripand I asked Juana if he had wronged
her.

Not yet, she said, he just came in after sending the Kash Guard away.
Something has happened. There is going to be a battle; but he sneaked
back to the safety of his quarters, and then she seemed to notice for
the first time that I was covered with blood. There has been a battle!
she cried, and you have been in it.

I told her that I had and that I would tell her about it after I had
finished Or-tis. He commenced to plead and then to whimper. He promised
me freedom and immunity from punishment and persecution if I would let
him live. He promised never to bother Juana again and to give us his
protection and assistance. He would have promised me the Sun and the
Moon and all the little stars had he thought I wished them; but I wished
only one thing just then and I told him soto see him die.

Had you wronged her, I said, you would have died a slow and terrible
death; but I came in time to save her and so you are saved that
suffering.

When he realized that nothing could save him he began to weep and his
knees shook so that he could not stand, and I had to hold him from the
floor with one hand and with my other clenched I dealt him a single
terrific blow between the eyesa blow that broke his neck and crushed
his skullthen I dropped him to the floor and took Juana in my arms.

Quickly, as we walked toward the entrance of the building, I told her of
all that had transpired since we parted and that now she would be left
alone in the world for awhile, until I could join her. I told her where
to go and await me in a forgotten spot I had discovered upon the banks
of the old canal on my journey to the mines. She cried and clung to me,
begging to remain with me; but I knew it could not be, for already I
could hear fighting in the yard below. We would be fortunate indeed if
one of us escaped. At last she promised on condition that I would join
her immediately, which, of course, I had intended doing as soon as I had
the chance.

Red Lightning stood where I had left him before the door. A company of
Kash Guard, evidently returning from the battle, were engaged with my
little band that was slowly falling back toward the headquarters
building. There was no time to be lost if Juana was to escape. I lifted
her to Red Lightnings back from where she stooped and threw her dear
arms about my neck, covering my lips with kisses.
