Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
"And you?" asked the skipper of Bill.

"I didn't know I'd find him here," answered Bill with a vindictive
squint at Tom, "or I wouldn't ha' come."

"Twin brothers," commented the captain, "and on bad terms! Well, you
will have little time to quarrel aboard this ship, and plenty of time
to make friends. It is too late to get rid of you; so you must work.
Put them in separate watches, Mr. Butterell."

"Yes, sir," answered Mr. Butterell, reaching for Bill. "I choose you,"
he added, as his grip closed on Bill's collar. Then he swung him at
arm's length aft toward the poop then forward with all his strength,
hurling him, rolling and scrambling wildly, fully thirty feet along the
deck. Then, with a quick, self-satisfied smirk up at those on the poop,
he repeated the feat upon Tom.

Now a few words about Mr. Butterell. He was, all in all, the most
efficient executive officer I had ever sailed with. He knew his
business, from knotting a rope yarn up to masting a ship. In shortening
sail he could get canvas in as though it obeyed an intelligent
knowledge of his wish; but it was really because of his wonderful voice
and vocabulary. He never missed or repeated an order, and could send
his words against a gale from the poop to the weather fore earing as
distinctly and articulately as he would read off morning sights to the
skipper.

Unlike myself, a graduate of the schoolship St. Mary, he had worked his
way up from the forecastle; yet he had mastered more of navigation
than do most merchant skippers, and could figure great circle sailing
and take star and lunar sights. Besides, as I learned on further
association with him, he possessed a conversational power rare in
seafaring men, but developed in him by wide reading and wide-open eyes.
Added to this, he had the build and strength of a giant, the agility
of a panther, the fistic skill of a prize-fighter--and the vanity of a
spoiled child.

He seemed unable to perform the most commonplace action without a
half-involuntary and quick look around to notice some possible token
of approval, and in the absence of his social or professional equals
would seek it from the men, even from the Chinese cook. And with this
weakness was allied another, still more incompatible with his assured
mental and physical strength--an active hatred for the class of men
from which he had risen. It was the first of these that had prompted
that quick smirk toward the poop, and the second that impelled him to
follow the two human projectiles and, with kicks, clouts, and forceful
language, hasten their progress forward.

It was nearly four bells of the first dog-watch, or, more explicitly,
about ten minutes to six in the evening, of the first day out, and
though the watches had not yet been chosen half the crew had gone to
supper at three bells, when the day's work was done, and now, having
finished, had struggled out of the forecastle lighting their pipes.
Also the captain, his daughter, and Mr. Butterell had eaten supper; but
the rest of the men and myself would not have ours until four bells.
Hence, for the time, all hands were on deck to witness the breaking in
of the stowaways.

I could see no approval in the faces of the men as they watched the
brutal spectacle, and in Mabel's, as I glanced upward, I saw horror and
fright; but in Captain Merwin's face was nothing to indicate approval
or disapproval. My own, however, must have reflected the strong disgust
that I felt; for the captain, seizing his daughter's arm, said, "Come,
Mabel," and led her aft.

"Afraid," I muttered bitterly, "to antagonize his fancy first mate!"
For Captain Merwin was a kindly man, and I had often heard him correct
his officers for assaulting the men.

The exhibition of prowess went merrily on, Mr. Butterell using the
helpless youths like billiard balls, knocking one against the other
and frequently making a carom against the rail. But at the main hatch,
after a peculiarly successful fist play in which both brothers struck
the rail and clung to it, Mr. Butterell turned his head quickly, looked
aft with the smirking expectancy of his face, and, finding the audience
for which he had performed no longer at the break of the poop, gave
over the play, and started aft with his face as sober as my own.

And before he had taken three steps one of the brothers--I could not
tell which at the distance--wrenched an iron belaying pin from the
rail and hurled it at his head. It missed; but continued on a flat
trajectory to the cabin, from which it rebounded after making an
inch dent and whirled forward again and over the lee rail. Had Mr.
Butterell's head stopped it, he would never have moved or spoken again.

He wheeled when the pin whizzed by him, and with a bound put himself
between the two and the forecastle; for each had turned forward.

"Who threw that belaying pin?" he said quietly but menacingly.
