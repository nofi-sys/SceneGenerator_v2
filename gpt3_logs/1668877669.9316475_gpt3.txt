Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
He told, as briefly as possible, how the horses had been stolen.

When I talked to the punchers down by the railroad corral, I got an
idea, he continued. You remember Gilly Froud, dont you? Short
nods came in answer. Well, Froud had a scar on the left side of his
face. So did one of the men who stole our broncs, accordin to the
fellers I talked to. That mean anything? he questioned.

Sure does, boss! Pop Burns exclaimed excitedly. Proves what I
been thinkin all along. This Froud is a rustler! I knowed that as
soon as I saw him tryin to carve out an X Bar X from a hunk of wood
one day down by the river. Came upon him sudden like, an he tried
to hide the wood on me. But I seen it. Seen the X Bar X brand, too.

Did, hey? Mr. Manley asked in an interested tone. You never told
me that. But let it go. We know who to look for now. Golly, shes
sure some dusty!

Ill tell a maverick! Roy murmured, wiping his brow.

The excitement of the first dash had somewhat worn off, and they
rode along now with a show of quiet determination.

Mr. Manley and Roy were in the lead. Their horses took on that long,
easy gait that carries a cowboy comfortably over thirty miles of
prairie in a day. No one knew just how long this chase would last.

Gus Tripp urged his mount closer to Mr. Manleys.

Say, boss, he drawled, I suppose you heard about the 8 X 8 bein
visited?

A little, Gus, Mr. Manley answered. Man on the train told me. Do
they know who the rustlers were?

Well, they got kind of an idee. Theres been other ranches missin
stock in just the same way that the 8 X 8 lost theirs. They say the
same gang does all the jobs.

They do, hey? Mr. Manley considered. I wonder-- He started, then
stopped. Whatever was in his mind he kept to himself.

Dad, are you figuring on stopping at Eagles? Teddy called. Maybe
we can find out something more from one or two of the men there.

Dont think so, son, his father answered. Theres a certain crowd
that hangs out in Eagles that I dont particularly hanker for. I
guess you know who I mean.

Theres one bird Id like to see again, Teddy remarked slowly.
The puncher who was outside Rimors. He needs a lesson in
politeness.

Mr. Manley nodded.

We may meet him again. Seemed to me he knew more than he wanted to
tell. Still, he might have been just plain ugly. You cant accuse a
man of bein a rustler because he wont answer questions.

Did some buckaroo answer you short? Pop wanted to know, pushing
his hat farther back on his head. Who was it?

Dont know, Teddy replied. He was leaning against Rimors Place
when the broncs were stolen. He must have seen them, sure! When we
asked him about them, he-- Well, never mind what he did. But he
didnt tell us.

Have on a checkered shirt? Pop asked. An no vest?

Yes, Teddy replied in a surprised tone. Howd you know, Pop?

I seen him, was the brief answer. Hes been stayin at Rimors.
Friend of Gilly Frouds.

He is? Roy exclaimed excitedly. Hear that, Dad?

I heard, Mr. Manley said briefly. I had an idea Id seen him
before. He rode out to the X Bar X one day and asked for Froud. When
I told him Froud was ridin cattle, he cut back for town. Yes, I
remember, now.

As they rode along, each man kept a sharp lookout for anything that
might indicate which way the rustlers had gone. There was not much
chance of finding a clue until they reached Eagles, yet they could
not afford to let any trace, no matter how slight, slip by
unnoticed.

They saw no sign of the thieves, however, and when the six riders
swung into Eagles, Mr. Manley had a determined look on his face. He
had been talking to Roy and Teddy about the puncher in the checkered
shirt. Deciding to locate the man if he could and to find out just
how much the puncher knew of the taking of the horses, Mr. Manley
stopped in front of Rimors.
