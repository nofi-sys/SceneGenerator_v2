SCENE:
V GIVING THE ENEMY THE SLIP


Please dont scold, Oscar, Ballyhoo was saying soon afterwards. I
understand I was a silly fool to take such big chances. The captain
knew what he was talking about when he told me to stay near the boat.

We all know now, Jack remarked, that the thrilling yarns told you by
your Uncle Abner Crawley were founded on truth. Hed seen those East
Indian pearl-divers stick sharks many a time; yes, and he even said
hed learned to do the same himself while out around Ceylon.

I think well be moving along pretty soon, Oscar remarked, not
wishing to add to the repentant Ballyhoos confusion, for I heard the
engineer tell Captain Shooks that he had things shipshape once more.

Then we can expect to be at our first destination any old time, Jack
went on to say, with an eager gleam in his eye; for he was yearning to
see some of the wonderful submarine sights that had been so vividly
described to them by the old deep sea master-diver.

Within ten minutes they discovered that the engines had started working
again, and a little while later their propeller began to churn the
water at the stern.

It was now late in the afternoon. They had really spent several hours
behind the island instead of the short space of time at first intended;
but then no one felt that it mattered to any great extent, since they
were in no particular hurry.

Let me have that glass, please, Oscar? Ballyhoo asked. Theres a
vessel off to the southwest, low down, and Ive got a sneaking notion
she looks a whole lot like that same _Dauntless_ we gave the slip to.

This, of course, aroused considerable interest on the part of the other
boys. Oscar obediently handed the marine glasses over, for they had
been lying close beside him on the little upper deck, which Ballyhoo
persisted in describing as the hurricane deck of the undersea boat.
Jack, on his part, ceased handling his camera, and also turned his eyes
in the direction indicated.

Hardly had Ballyhoo located the object he had been watching than he
gave a satisfied grunt.

That means you were right, I take it? remarked Oscar.

Just what it does, came the ready answer. Shes beat us down here,
and seems to know just about where we ought to turn up, hang the luck!

Oh! nothing much to worry about yet, Oscar told him. Whenever we
feel like giving her the once over, all we have to do is to turn the
nose of our craft down, kick our heels in the air, and disappear, to
come up fifty miles away in any old direction.

Guess youre right there, Oscar, admitted the boy who still held the
glasses glued to his eyes, as though fairly fascinated by the abrupt
reappearance of the mysterious black craft, which, as they knew, must
be manned by the rival party under the lead of that reckless buccaneer
of fortune, Captain Badger.

Thats the beauty of these submarine wrecking craft, laughed Jack;
they can swim on the surface in fair weather, dive below in foul,
remain hidden about as long as they please, and all the while be making
their little eight or ten knots an hour in any old direction. Yes, they
are as hard to locate as a jumping flea--now youve got him, but when
you go to look he isnt there.

Captain Shooks had been summoned on deck, and agreed with the boys
the boat was their persistent rival that continued to shadow them. As
evening was coming on he laid his plan of campaign accordingly. They
started off on a course at right angles with the one they had intended
to take. This would, of course, deceive the enemy, doubtless keeping a
watch over their movements all the while.

When it gets good and dark, explained Oscar to his comrades, why, we
mean to dip under, turn around, and head into the southwest again. Once
we get twenty miles away from this point, and it will be safe for us
to come to the surface again, because our lights wont show. By that
time theyll be in a haze, and dodging every-which-way, looking for a
speck on the water.

So the sun set, and, as always happens down toward the tropics, there
was a very short intermission between that event and the coming of
darkness. Twilight belongs to the Northern zones.

When the call to supper came it was already growing dusk.

Well not be up again to-night, I reckon, assumed Ballyhoo, with a
sigh, for to tell the truth he did not particularly relish being made
a prisoner inside that strange boat, and kept hermetically sealed
far below the surface of the ocean, just as much shut-in, he often
said, as sardines in a can, or one of those old mummies weve seen in
museums when they were kept tight in their sarcophagi.
