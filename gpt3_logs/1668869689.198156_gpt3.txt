Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
"Call all hands," I commanded. "The captain is half insane and is bent
upon jumping overboard with the owner. Separate them."

"Not much," he said. "I've nothing to do with their troubles, but I've
got my living to make. Both have power to fire me, and no matter who
wins, I'd get it in the neck."

"Men, come aft here," I shouted to the sailors. The men forward came
toward me, but were stopped by the mate.

"Go back," he said. "This is none of your funeral nor mine. Let the
owner settle his own affairs."

They obeyed him, and drew away. Of course, they did not know. I ran
aft to the companion. Dunbar and Lance were just at the upper step.
Dunbar was speaking, quietly, softly, yet intensely upon the matter in
hand--the absolute necessity of their both dying. He had one hand on
Lance's throat, the other upon his hair, and he was dragging him bodily
out of the companion.

"Dunbar!" I shouted, "stop this. You are insane. Put him in irons and
take time to think. Then you will not want to do this. Think, Dunbar."

He did not answer. His grim, determined face did not change nor soften.
He was the master of the other and was using his power. Slowly, while
Lance struggled and shrieked for help, he dragged him over toward the
rail.

"Drop your wheel," I said to the helmsman, "and help me to stop this
murder and suicide."

"Can't leave the wheel, sir," the man answered. "Get some of the other
fellows."

The other fellows were under control of the mate, careful of his job. I
was in despair, and in my despair I threw myself upon Dunbar, demanding
that he desist. He struck me down with a blow, and while I was in a
half-comatose condition, I saw a white-clad figure emerge from the
companion, and approach the contestants. It was Ella, in her night
robe, pale and weak, but determined.

"John," she said, as she laid her hand on the shoulder of Dunbar, "John
Dunbar. Stop. If you do this I will die, too. Do you want to kill me?
Stop, or you _will_ kill me. Stop, John Dunbar, and think of me, the
woman you say you loved."

Dunbar released his hold on Lance, and while the terror-stricken
scoundrel rushed to the companion, he turned toward the girl, his face
twisting with the conflicting emotions of his brain. I staggered to my
feet, reached her side and supported her.

"John Dunbar," she continued, "you are too big, and strong, and brave,
to do this thing--to kill yourself so that you may kill another. Live,
so that I may live, too. God will care for him."

Dunbar shook like a man with the ague, and it was some time before he
could control his voice in answer.

"I _can_ live," he stammered, "for you. But, is it possible? You love
him."

"I do not. He killed my child--his child."

Dunbar stiffened up and looked around.

"Mr. Wright," he called to the first mate. "Put the owner in irons and
lock him in his room."

"Aye, aye, sir," answered the officer.

And so, with the help of four husky, able seamen, Mr. George Lance,
owner of the yacht _Sylph_, was ironed and confined by order of his
sailing-master, charged with the crime of murder.

We returned to New York. Ella, collapsing in my arms after her
declaration to Dunbar, was put to bed by my wife, and slowly recovered
her strength. Dunbar, somewhat changed by what she had said, grew
tranquil, but non-committal. My wife recovered her equanimity, and
expressed hope for the future, in which hope I joined her; but Lance,
with his wrists linked by handcuffs, and his soul tortured by deadly
fear, reviled us all whenever his opened stateroom door gave him
opportunity.

There is little more to this story. We anchored, handed Lance over to
the harbor police, and went home to await the trial. Dunbar, whose
testimony was not needed, secured command of a ship and went to sea.
Ella remained in seclusion and was not dragged into the trial when
it came off; for Lance, on the evidence furnished by the man at the
wheel, my wife and myself, was easily convicted and sentenced to life
imprisonment. But there were the usual appeals and retrials, and,
pending the final disposal of the case, and with regard to Ella's
future, I moved my goods and chattels to a far-away city, there to
build up a new practice in a community that knew nothing of the trial.
