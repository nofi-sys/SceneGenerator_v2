SCENE:
XXIII

Boss and Bandit


Teddy, hand resting on the gun, eyes wide, stared at the prostrate
intruder. Something about the man seemed familiar. As he lay there,
his arms thrown wide, head turned to one side, he appeared to have
been dropped from a great height and pressed into the earth from the
force of descent. The fingers weakly opened and closed, but aside
from that the figure was motionless, silent.

Teddy dropped on one knee, and laid a hand on the mans shoulder. A
shudder ran through the body.

Here! Teddy said sharply. Whats the matter? Can you speak?

Tired, the man mumbled. Hungry. Let me be.

Roy, who was lying near by, awoke and sat up, blinking. When he saw
his brother bending over the man he thought at first that Teddy was
trying to rouse one of the sleepers.

Shake him, Teddy, he advised in a drowsy voice. Whats the
matter--did he steal your blanket?

Roy, come here, Teddy said quickly. I think this is some one you
know.

Some one I-- Then the meaning of Teddys sentence penetrated his
brothers half-awakened mind, and he struggled to his feet. By this
time the others were stirring, asking questions in sleepy tones and
rolling about to see the cause of the disturbance.

Roy hastened to his brothers side. Together, the two boys turned
the man over, so that he faced the fire. As the glare of the newly
fed flames glinted in his face, he made a feeble gesture of protest
and covered his eyes with his hand. Then letting the arm drop like a
dead thing, he sighed painfully.

Teddy, seeing the face, started back.

The Pup! he exclaimed, and turned at a touch on his shoulder. His
father was peering down at their visitor.

Its Marino, all right, Mr. Manley agreed grimly, staring at the
dust-streaked face. Is he hurt? Whats the matter?

Teddy shook the man gently.

Are you hurt, Joe? the boy asked loudly. Cant you talk?

Talk all right--too tired, The Pup mumbled. Not
hurt--tired--hungry. Then for the first time he seemed to realize
that he was surrounded by a ring of inquiring, puzzled faces. He
pulled himself together and glared haggardly at Teddy, then shifted
his gaze to Roy, and finally to Mr. Manley. Suddenly the light of
fear came into his eyes, and he leaped to his feet, trembling.

Dont--dont shoot me, he begged piteously. Ill go! But dont
shoot me!

No ones going to shoot you, Mr. Manley said soothingly. Here,
sit down. Take this blanket. Man, youre shiverin like a leaf. Get
closer to the fire--thats it! Pop rustle up some beans for this
feller, will you? He looks half starved.

Half starved! the man gasped, querulously, and sank within
himself. Worsen that. Three days without food--lost--horse gone--

Pop Burns brought some cold beans to him, and, hungrily, ravenously,
the man reached for them. They watched him while he ate, more like a
wild beast than a human being, and later Pop brought him a cup of
steaming coffee. When he had finished this he sighed with relief and
wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. His voice, when again he
spoke, was stronger.

Boss, he said, turning to Mr. Manley, I dont deserve this. By
rights you should have thrown me out on my neck. Instead you-- he
hesitated, and waved his arm in an expressive gesture--you treat me
like a man instead of like a--a mangy dog. He gulped, and his
listeners shifted uneasily. I aint worth it. Im a thief--a hoss
thief an a common robber. Once I-- But well let that go. I aint
got yore money, boss, he said suddenly, and looked up appealingly.
I aint got a cent of it left.

You spent it? Mr. Manley asked sharply.

I been robbed, The Pup continued, and gulped again. Been robbed
of everything I had except the hoss, an he ran away. For three days
I been walkin--tryin to find some one--any one--tryin to find
food--
