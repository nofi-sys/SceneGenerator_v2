SCENE:
The sun had already been hidden from view by the huge bluff behind the
house, though it was still broad daylight at the homestead, and good
Mrs. Bartram had dallied in her supper work to talk with Nathans wife,
when the Squire put his head in at the door to announce that Professor
Russell, the noted seer, medium, and clairvoyant, would honor them with
a visit and give them proof of his supernatural powers.

For the lands sake, exclaimed Mrs. Bartram, why didnt you tell us
before! Here I haint got my work done up yet. How long before hell be
here, I wonder?

O, not for a half hour or so; he stopped down to Job Atkins to help
find them that colt that was lost, replied the Squire.

And how can he help them, unless hes the one that took it? Them that
hides can find, I take it, continued the good lady, with a sniff. I
havent much use for these folks that knows _too_ much and whose ways
are dark.

Wait until after you see the Professor, before you judge, said the
Squire.

And so we are to be entertained to-night by one who is in league with
the powers of darkness, said Donald, a young man of eighteen years, as
he entered the family room and seated himself by the side of his new
sister-in-law. Lissa, dont you tremble at the thought of the evil
wraiths that are to fill this room?

I fear more the evil spirit that shall animate your Professor, Donald,
replied Melissa, who in her Eastern home had imbibed a deep prejudice
against the so-called spiritualists.

His spirit? Mne, let me see. I believe a big Injun, Stuck-in-the-mud,
or some such high-sounding name, is his especial _Control_; but he is
not confined to one familiar. His demons are many.

How absurd, laughed Lissa.

You wont say so after to-night. Ill wager the best pony on the ranch
youll be a firm convert before the evening is over. Maybe Ill add a
side-saddle, too. Eh, Lissa?

Im afraid I cant gratify you by accepting any such foolishness as
that, even for the sake of the saddle, or permit you to wager upon a
certainty of losing.

Did I ever tell you how the Professor found his wife? Donald asked.

No, but I suppose youll tell me through some celestial matrimonial
agency, she replied.

Sure! His wife was a strongly developed medium living in London,
England. One day, while in a trance, the Professor, here in the United
States, was made cognizant of the existence of this lady by spirit
agency, and instructed to write to her, which he did. It seems she had
received a communication concerning him at about the same time and in
the same manner, with the same instructions, which she also followed.
The two letters reached their destinations simultaneously, and each
person, with the others letter in hand, could summon the writers
materialized spirit before him. In this way they communicated with each
other at will, and finally the lady embarked for this country at his
request. He was kept daily informed as to her whereabouts, and when she
arrived at New York he was there to meet her, and they were married
speedily, only one letter from each having passed between them, and yet
each was well acquainted with the past history of the other.

Impossible! You must be very credulous, Donald, to believe such a story
as that.

Quite convenient, wasnt it? If the black powers would deal as kindly
with me I should not long remain a bachelor. This knowing to a certainty
all about the lady of ones choice would remove the fear of flying into
the dangers we know not of. One could be certain then if she did up her
hair on curl-papers. And Donald glanced significantly at Lissas
shining ringlets.

Surely, you dont pretend to believe such a preposterous story,
Donald, she said, laughing.

We have the Professor and his wife to testify to it, neither one ever
known to lprevaricate; and in the mouths of two witnesses the truth
shall be affirmed, misquoted Donald. At any rate one story is good
until another is told.

They must be a pair of charlatans, and I dont think I care to make
their acquaintance.

I suspect you begin to fear them. There is no telling what they may
discover, Donald said with mock gravity. But here comes the
redoubtable hero himself. All hail, ye Prince of Darkness, hail! he
continued in a sepulchral voice, as a step was heard outside the door.
