SCENE:
V

MURAL PAINTINGS


JOHN walked up the flagged path of the churchyard. Sounds of work came
to him through the little Norman doorway--the beating of hammers, the
rasping of saws, the jangle of buckets.

Arrived at the doorway he paused for a moment to look at the scene
before him. It would seem almost incredible that order should ever be
abstracted from the present chaos, at all events in the space of time
proposed. Doorless, windowless,--in the matter of glass,--it was a mere
shell of a church, filled with scaffolding, planks, barrows, buckets;
echoing with the ceaseless sound of hammering, sawing, chiselling,
planing; while, within the shell, the creators of the various noises
moved and worked like a handful of restless ants.

John looked towards the scaffolding surrounding the east window.
Perched high on a narrow planked platform was Corin, absorbed in his
work, entirely lost to the sounds around him.

John picked his way among the scattered dbris made for the chancel.
Here there was a ladder roped against a lower platform, from whence, by
means of a second ladder placed thereon, Corins eyrie might be gained.
John had his foot on a rung of the first ladder in a trice, swarmed up
it, and a second or so later was giving Corin warning of his approach
by:

Behold the little cherub perched aloft.

Corin turned.

Oh, its you, is it? Well, just come and look. There was suppressed
exultation in his voice.

John scrambled on to the platform, came alongside Corin,--Corin who
pointed with a triumphant chisel.

Some half-dozen or so square yards of wall had been cleared of many
coats of plaster, and there, on the original groundwork, stood out thin
red lines vertical and horizontal, flowers in bold outline.

Masonry, they call it, announced Corin, and the flower is the herb
Robert. Isnt it gorgeous?

Now to the purely uninitiated, to the mere casual observer, the adverb
might have appeared unduly extravagant. What, such a one might have
demanded, was there in a few crude brush lines to justify this mode of
speech? Yet John, artist though he was not, understood, and not only
understood, but endorsed to the full Corins rapture. Here was the work
of age-old centuries, the frank expression of some long-ago-forgotten
painter, brought once more to the light of day. Fresh as when first
limned the simple lines glowed crimson from the cream-coloured surface
of the wall.

Its--its fine, said John simply.

Corin, radiant, beaming, waved his chisel in a comprehensive sweep
around the walls.

And think, cried he exultant, what more there may be, there
assuredly is, to find. Think what further glories this plaster hides.
Man, its hard to restrain ones impatience and not hack, which would
be a truly disastrous proceeding.

John laughed.

Then, Try another spot, he urged. Here, close by the east window.
Ill not divert the stroke of the chisel by the faintest whisper.

Pretending to a half-reluctance, though at heart, truly, he was nothing
loath to consent, Corin let himself be persuaded. He shifted his
position. By the outer edge of the window splay he raised his chisel
and set himself to work.

The outer coats of plaster fell in thick flakes before that same
remorseless chisel; they crumbled on to the platform upon which Corin
stood. Below the plaster was a thin substance lying on the wall like a
film. Here the chisel came lightly into play; that film must be removed
carefully, with touch as delicate as the touch of a butterflys wing.
It entailed a suspension of breath, an excited prevention of the merest
involuntary quivering of a muscle. The film broke and powdered at the
lightest stroke, covering Corins hand and wrist with a soft grey dust.
Breathless he pursued his work; then, suddenly, he stopped, his eyes
gleaming with pleasure.

John bent forward. Here assuredly was novelty,--no longer the crimson
masonry, but black chevrons set within two narrow black lines showed
on the cream-coloured wall, and extending, it was evident, around the
whole window.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

John walks up to the churchyard and sees the Norman doorway. He hears the sound of workmen inside and pauses to look. He sees the scaffolding and barrows and thinks it will be difficult to make order out of the chaos. He goes in and sees Corin, high up on a platform, working on the east window. John climbs up to the platform and admires the work. Corin explains that they are masonry lines and the flower is the herb Robert. John is impressed. They discuss the possibility of finding more treasures hidden in the plaster and Corin shows John a spot where he has found black chevrons.
