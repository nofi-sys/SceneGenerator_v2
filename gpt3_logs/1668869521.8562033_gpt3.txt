What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
In my watch, besides myself, were Jack Sullivan, an intelligent young
Irish-American; Swansen, a big, good-natured Swede--a Sou'wegian,
we called him--Wilkinson and Tompkins, two Jerseyites; Andrus, the
Australian, the youngest and least efficient of the ship's company, but
the most intelligent; and Devlin, an Irish, hot-headed graduate of the
Dublin university, who had gone to sea from sheer rebellion against
the conventionalities of shore life. We were a congenial, cheerful lot
of good fellows, ready for work or play or fight--only there was no
occasion for the latter.

We had our afternoon watch and first dog-watch below, a rare condition
in American ships, and on Sundays a liberal dinner of duff and good
wholesome beef sweetened to the flavor of corned beef by an overnight
soaking in fresh water. Each Sunday, while the trades lasted, all
hands remained on deck in both forenoon and afternoon watches, to
wash clothes, overhaul and air dunnage, to shave or be shaved and to
mutually cut hair, all of us confident of a good night's sleep, even
on deck; for braces are rarely touched at night while the trades are
blowing.

But on a Sunday morning, just after the trades had blown out, the
young Irish ne'er-do-well wanted a haircut and a shave. Wilkinson
and Tompkins had proved the best barbers, and had done all the work
heretofore; but this time they rebelled; they were tired of it, and,
besides, a squall was coming. Devlin vociferated and declaimed, saying
that he had looked like a dog long enough, and finally, to appease
him, young Andrus volunteered the task; so Devlin sat down on the
fore-hatch, and Andrus went to work, with mock pitying comments on his
doglike face.

"Of course, you're a dog," he would say, "the Skye terrier breed; but
I'll make a fox terrier out of you 'fore I'm done. Keep quiet. I can't
cut your hair while you're wriggling like a cat in a bathtub. You're
not a cat; you're a dog."

Devlin finally ceased his profane comment and wriggling, sitting quiet
until the clipping was done; then Andrus, after a walk to the rail and
a look at the growing squall to the westward, came back, saying that
there was time for a shave--which Devlin needed as badly as a haircut.

"Quiet, you dog!" he said jokingly. "You're a Skye terrier now, and
I'll soon make you a fox terrier--just as soon as I get that fur off
your face."

He shaved him clumsily but quickly, then stood back.

"Now, Devlin," he said, still carrying on the good-natured raillery,
"you're as handsome a dog as I ever saw. Let's hear you bark."

To our astonishment, Devlin emitted a series of canine sounds, and
ended with a menacing growl. He still sat quietly on the hatch,
however, without a sign or a smile on his face to indicate that he
fell in with the joke. Then came a shout from the mate, calling us to
halyards, clewlines, and buntlines, to shorten down for the squall.

We answered, and it was not until the squall had passed and sail made
again that we noticed that Devlin still sat on the hatch, occasionally
giving voice to barks and growls. We spoke to him, but received only
growls.

The skipper and mates came forward, and commanded him; he answered by
louder barks and deeper growls. We continued for an hour, and at last
he became violent. He was put into his berth, voted crazy from some
cause inherent in his nature, and ministered unto by all hands.

He grew quiet in a few days, but never regained his senses. We would
talk to him, coax him to answer, and even sing the old forecastle songs
to him; but all we received in answer were barks and growls, and soon
we perceived that he had forgotten the use of his pan, pannikin, and
spoon. We sorrowfully taught him to eat.

And we mourned also for another good fellow, from the time of that
squall that followed the barbering. Andrus, the Australian, had been
lost overboard. At a time when royals and topgallant sails were
flapping and fluttering, the ship laid over by the squall until the
lee rail was buried, and, with wind abeam, making twelve knots, Andrus
had floundered down into the water in the waist to rescue the ship's
cat, old Tom, that had been caught unawares and was in danger of
floating overboard.

No one knew just how it happened. We only knew that the ship righted
for a moment, then sagged back to a farther angle, and, when next she
righted, Andrus and the cat were gone.

We let the canvas flap and carry away, while we strove to back the main
yards, and the skipper threw over life-buoys and gratings. But in that
furious wind we could not gain an inch on the main-brace, and by the
time we realized this Andrus and the cat, life-buoys, and gratings must
have been a mile astern. There was a ship on the horizon, following in
our wake, but it was past all reason that Andrus, who we knew could not
swim, should reach a life-buoy or grating and be picked up.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Devlin and to foreshadow the events to come. Devlin is established as a hot-headed, rebellious Irishman who is not afraid to speak his mind. He is also shown to be somewhat of a ne'er-do-well. The author achieves these goals by having Devlin argue with the other sailors and then volunteer to give them haircuts and shaves. This establishes his character as someone who is not afraid of a challenge and who is willing to take on tasks that others do not want to do. The author also foreshadows the events to come by having Devlin growl and bark like a dog after his haircut and shave. This foreshadows the fact that Devlin will later go crazy and start barking like a dog.
