Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Miss Byrd, he began, as soon as he was seated. Some time ago I
received an application from you for work? Do you still want it?

Miss Byrd nodded. Very much, she said. I hope you have some for me.

That depends! Your sister has done very good work for the Gazette.
Risdon here suggested sending her to South America. He and she both
fooled me; they got me to send her for one thing, and they arranged
for her to do another. But shes done both very well.

Im glad!

Thats one reason why Im inclined to give you a chance. I am told
that you speak German fluently, Miss Byrd.

Nellie nodded. About as well as I do English, she declared.

Very good! If you will apply tomorrow to Senator Pratt--you know his
address--he will engage you as his daughters social secretary at
twenty-five dollars a week. The Gazette will pay you forty dollars
more.

Nellie Byrds pale face bloomed with sudden vivid color. McNew staring
at her, read her thoughts, and smiled grimly. He enjoyed startling
people.

Whats the matter? he demanded.

Nellies color receded, leaving her pale. She looked at McNew
thoughtfully, apparently trying to fathom him.

I hoped you could give me a chance to try something besides acting
as social secretary, she syllabled, slowly. But beggars mustnt be
choosers. I understand the twenty-five dollars, but why the forty. What
service do I render the Gazette when I am acting as social secretary
for Senator Pratt.

McNew watched the light coming and going behind the girls clear blue
eyes. For the forty dollars, he answered, slowly. I wish you to
watch and report to me every act of the Countess del Ouro Preto, who is
spending the winter with Miss Pratt? Will you do it?

No! If Nellie Byrd was disappointed, she concealed the fact well. Her
voice came as calm as ever. You are mistaken in me, Mr. McNew. I am
not a spy.

Why not? McNew shot the question at her. Why not? Why not? Tell me
why not.

It is not honorable.

Honorable! Honorable! Was Nathan Hale dishonorable? Was Major Andree
dishonorable?

Miss Byrd shook her head. They were soldiers. What they did they
did for their country. That fact glorified their acts. They were not
newspaper spies.

McNew hitched his chair forward. His eyes glowed. Miss Byrd, he said,
slowly. In watching the Countess del Ouro Preto you will probably be
doing a service to your country scarcely less than that of a spy in
a war. You will not be risking death, but you will be risking your
social standing, which you would probably lose if it became known that
you were a Gazette spy. I have reason to believe that the countess
is the channel of communication between the German and the Japanese
Ambassadors in a plot to humiliate the United States--perhaps to
involve it in war. I want to know the truth; I want to know it in order
to get an exclusive story for the Gazette. But I want still more to
know it for the sake of the United States. The Monroe doctrine--But
Risdon will explain that to you.

Miss Byrd turned to Risdon while McNew leaned back and watched the
changes flit over her delicate face as the younger man talked. A new
shade of earnestness, altogether charming, crept over it toward the end.

Risdon went over the situation as he understood it to exist. He told of
the petition of the Ouro Pretos to the Emperor and its supposed result;
of the rebellion that broke out shortly afterwards in Brazil; of the
visit (reported by a Gazette correspondent) of the Countess to Japan;
of her return to the United States and of her alleged conferences
with the Japanese and German ambassadors; and called attention to the
growing excitement in California growing out of the strike and boycott
that was being enforced against the Japanese restaurants, and out of
the denial of public school privileges to the Japanese in San Francisco.

McNew broke in. Your sister, he said, has sent some incendiary yarns
from Brazil--which I have not printed. Yesterday she cabled the worst
of all. Shes on her way home now, by the way.

Nellies eyes brightened. Oh! is she? she cried. Im so glad. I
didnt know.
