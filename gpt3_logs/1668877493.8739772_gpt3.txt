SCENE:
XLI

AT SOME LENGTH


ELIZABETH sat down on the bench beside him. Her whole demeanour said as
plainly as speech:

Take your own time. I have nothing on earth to do but listen to
you. Nothing will give me greater pleasure. This is what I have been
wanting.

It is astonishing what confidence such an attitude will give.
Confidences--hesitating confidences, at all events--will take flight
before the least trace of urgency. If you think youve got to be in a
hurry to show them, they hide like shy children in the inmost recesses
of your soul, and no amount of coaxing will bring them forth to the
light of day. You may, by dint of violent effort, force them forth, so
to speak; but, coming unwillingly, they show no trace of their true
personality. You barely recognize them yourself; a stranger will not
recognize them at all, unless he be the one in a million endowed with
an almost uncanny gift of insight. And such a one, to my thinking, will
never hurry confidences.

Do you mind my smoking? asked David.

Not a bit, returned Elizabeth cheerily.

David pulled pipe and tobacco pouch from his pocket. Busy with them, he
spoke.

I am a bad hand at talking, said he. Words are slippery kind of
things, and slide out of my mind as soon as I think Ive got them fixed
there; so, if I talk in a muddle, perhaps youll forgive me. I cant
even get what I want to say very clearly to myself.

He paused to light his pipe. Then went on:

I fancy Ill have to talk a bit in kind of symbols. I see things
that way myself better than in actual descriptive words. You know, of
course, my reason for being here?

I do, responded Elizabeth.

David was silent for a moment.

Well, he said presently, pulling at his pipe, when I set out on this
job, I didnt think much about the right or wrong of it. It was simply
there. It got up and stood before me suddenly, and I said to myself,
Thats what Im going for. I went for it. Theres no need to go into
details. It wasnt an easy undertaking, but I brought it through. What
I set out to get is mine. Its there. Ive only got to put out my hand
and take it.

Yes, said Elizabeth, as he stopped.

Well, said David frowning, now comes the difficult part to put
into words. What Im going to say may sound rubbish; but, for the
life of me, I dont think it is. Im going to get to symbols now. Can
you figure to yourself a man finding a mighty powerful telescope;
and, looking through it, he sees a sack of gold lying in a place some
thousands of miles away, and he knows that the sack is his for the
seeking. Well, he doesnt think much about the wisdom of the search,
or its difficulties, or what hes going to do with the gold when he
gets it. He just knows its there, and its his if he can get to it. It
isnt easy to find, and there are other people who think theyve got
the right to it. But anyhow he gets there, and establishes his claim.
Hes got nothing to do now, but put in his hand and take everything
that is in the sack. It seems simple enough, doesnt it?

It does, said Elizabeth smiling. The navet of his words amused her.

But, went on David, just as hes waiting to take possession of
the whole thing, he suddenly gets a glimpse of something else, a bit
further on. Now, he doesnt for the life of him know exactly what it
is, or what use hes going to make of it, only theres some kind of
voice telling him all the time that its worth going for. Thats pretty
nearly all he knows about it. Common-sense seems to say to him, Empty
your sack first, and then go on and have a look. But way back in his
mind he has three thoughts,--one is that he hasnt any darned use for
the gold in the sack, he doesnt know what to make of it--you remember
Im speaking in symbols; the second is that somehow it will be a bother
carrying it along with him on this other quest; and the third is a
queer sort of idea as to whether the gold is really his after all. Of
course everybody tells him it is. Even the folk, who originally had the
handling of it, are bound to say it must be, and yet he doesnt feel
dead sure. Do you see what Im driving at?

Perfectly, said Elizabeth.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict that David is feeling between his desire for the gold and his desire for the unknown thing that he sees before him. The author achieves this by having David explain his dilemma to Elizabeth in a series of symbols.
