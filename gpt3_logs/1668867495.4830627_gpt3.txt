SCENE:
VIII TALK ABOUT LUCK!


Although they had been passing through these fields of water ferns
and tree-like forms for only half an hour or so, the boys were ready
to declare that the reality far exceeded even their most sanguine
expectations.

Of course, Jack admitted when they commenced talking about their
work, and what a satisfaction it was not to be disappointed, this
thing will get a bit monotonous in due course, unless we keep on
meeting up with new sights. But then down here in these depths theres
apt to be something novel happening any old time; just as that terrible
fight between the two species of sharks turned out.

We had the same sort of luck out in Africa, remember, Ballyhoo
reminded the other two chums. Whenever things got a little dull along
would come something out of the ordinary to liven up the show. When we
got through taking pictures of all the wild animals that could be met
with in the jungle and the forest, why, what followed but that trip to
the black kings kraal, where we saw his army drill, and watched em do
the Lion Dance to the tune of a horrid din.

The crew had before this fallen away from the ports, and gone back to
their customary work. They saw little that was attractive about those
waving forests of singular submarine growths; though the prospect of
another fight between some of the denizens of the depths would have
brought them rushing forward again.

Notice how the skipper keeps lunging from side to side as we move
along? observed Oscar. He is scouring the ground as he goes forward.
By the time weve made several revolutions around Coco Key well know
whether there was any truth in that old yarn about the sunken hulk, or
not.

Well, ventured Ballyhoo, with a shrug of his shoulders that was
intended to express incredulity, so far as Im concerned I reckon it
was only a fishy story that some newspaper man got up just to fill
space. You never know how much to believe of anything you see in the
newspapers nowadays, when the reporters are paid for space.

The proof of the pudding is the eating of the same, laughed Oscar;
so well not quite condemn that yarn until weve proved it to be a
bad egg. Youd feel pretty cheap, Ballyhoo, if we really did uncover
something in the shape of an old hulk, whether it held any treasure or
not.

Oh! I surely hope they do, for the captains sake, yes, and for
Uncle Abners, too; because hes sunk a wheen of good hard cash in
this venture, that he may never get back again. With us, now, its
different, I claim, for were going about a legitimate business. Let us
get our pictures, and its going to line our pockets with gold. Thats
the way to do things, according to my notion.

Stop and think, said Jack, how would we ever have found such a
glorious chance to accomplish what were aiming to do now if it hadnt
been for this same wildcat treasure hunting expedition youre harping
on? Sometimes its cruel to look a gift-horse in the mouth, Ballyhoo.

Kick me, Oscar, said the other contritely, for I certainly deserve
it. And after this Ill try and keep my thoughts to myself, especially
when they run counter to the balance of you. Sure I hope the captainll
strike it rich, and locate this Aladdin stuff--or was it King Midas who
had everything he touched turned straightway into gold, even the coffee
he drank at meals?

Before either of the others could say another word they all became
conscious of a perceptible shock that made the little submarine tremble
all over as though stricken by a monster fist.

Wow! was that my whale butting into us? gasped Ballyhoo, who had only
managed to keep himself from falling by clutching a convenient cleat on
the wall.

Weve run up against something that was hidden among the waving, giant
water ferns, thats sure! ejaculated Oscar anxiously.

They listened. Men could be heard calling out excitedly. The engines
had stopped working, and the boys immediately felt a dreadful fear grip
their hearts--had the motive power been disabled, and would they be
unable to rise again to the surface when the compressed air chambers no
longer contained the elements necessary to keep the imprisoned voyagers
alive?

They may have remembered how the crew of an ill-fated U. S. submarine
out at Hawaii had some accident occur that caused the boat to sink to
the bottom of the sea in a deep hole; and that delay in rescuing her
imprisoned crew resulted in the death of every one in the doomed boat.

Strange how things like this, common incidents under normal conditions,
and simply glanced at in curiosity among other news items, arise to
stagger one when suddenly placed in similar distressing conditions.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The submarine hits something hidden among the waving, giant water ferns, causing the engines to stop working. The boys are worried they won't be able to rise to the surface again and will suffocate.
