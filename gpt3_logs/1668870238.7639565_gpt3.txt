SCENE:
"What do you want to trim your ship with--red, white and blue?"
demanded Amy. "If that trough sinks I know you can swim, Charlie."

The crowd would have had some difficulty in getting back to shore with
the wind blowing as freshly as it did if the girls had not come along
and, in relays, helped them all back.

"What Mrs. Shannon will say when she sees her two washtubs floating off
like that, I don't know," sighed Henrietta, after they were all ashore.

"One of 'em's sunk, so she can't see it," Micky Costello said calmly.
"Maybe the other will go down. Don't you big girls say anything and
maybe she won't find it out."

Jessie and Amy had headed for Dogtown in the first place without any
expectation of playing a life-saving part. Jessie thought they ought
to see Mrs. Foley, who was fleshy and easy of disposition, and ask her
about Henrietta's visit. So they accompanied the freckle-faced little
girl to the Foley house.

"I ain't telling 'em all they can come to visit my island, Miss
Jessie," said the little girl. "But of course, the Foleys could come.
Mrs. Blair and Bertha wouldn't mind just them, of course. There's only
Mrs. Foley and Charlie and Billy and the baby and three more boys
and--and--well, that's all, only Mr. Foley. He wouldn't want to come."

"You would better be sure of your island, and just how much you own
of it, Hen," advised Amy Drew. "It may not be big enough to hold
everybody you want to invite."

"Why, Miss Amy, it's a awful big island," declared little Henrietta.
"It's got a whole golf link on it. I heard Mr. Blair say so."

The "bulgy" Mrs. Foley welcomed the Roselawn girls with her usual
copiousness. Of course, she had the youngest Foley in her lap, and the
housework was "at sixes and sevens," since little Henrietta had been at
Stratfordtown for a week.

"How I'm going to git used, young ladies, to havin' that child away is
more than I can say. 'Tis a great mistake I have all boys for childers.
There is nothing like a smart girl around the house."

Jessie, very curious, asked the woman what she knew about Henrietta's
wonderful story of wealth.

"Sure, I've always expected it would come to her some day," declared
Mrs. Foley. "Her mother, who was a good neighbor of mine before we
moved out here to the lake, said Hen's father come of rich folks. They
used to drive their own carriage. That was before automobiles come in
so plenteous."

"Did Bertha ever say anything about it, Mrs. Foley?"

"Not much. 'Tis Hen will be the rich wan. Oh, yes. And glad I am if the
child is about to come into her own. She's no business to be running
down here every chance she gets. I had himself telephone to Bertha when
he went to town this morning, and it is likely she will be here after
the child. Hen's as wild as a hawk."

Bertha Blair, in fact, appeared in a hired car before Jessie and Amy
were ready to return in their canoe to Roselawn. She was quite as
excited as Henrietta had been about the strange fortune that promised
to come into their lives. Bertha could tell the chums from Roselawn
many more particulars of the Padriac Haney property.

"If little Henrietta will only be good and not be so wild and learn her
lessons and mind what she's told," Bertha said seriously, "maybe she
will have money and an island--or part of one, anyway. But she does not
behave very well. She is as wild as a March hare."

Little Henrietta looked serious for her; but Mrs. Foley took her part
at once.

"Sure don't be expectin' too much of the child at wance, Bertha. She's
run as wild as the wind itself here. She's fought and played with these
Dogtown kids since she was able to toddle around. What would ye expect?"

"But she must learn," declared the older girl. "Mrs. Blair won't take
us to the island this summer if she is not good."

"Then I'll go myself," announced Henrietta. "It's my island, ain't it?
Who has a better right there?"

Jessie took a hand at this point, shaking her head gravely at the
freckled little girl.

"Do you suppose, Henrietta Haney, that your friends--like Mrs. Foley or
Mrs. Blair, or even Amy and I--will want to come to your island to see
you if you are not a good girl?"
