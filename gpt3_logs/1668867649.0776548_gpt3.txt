SCENE:
XV WHEN MORNING CAME


The setting sun told them that evening was near at hand. Captain Shooks
had determined to work through the whole night, using shifts so as to
make the labor continuous; and he himself promised to share this duty
with the two divers.

The sooner they exhausted the chances of finding more of the treasure
the better. With the _Dauntless_ so close at hand their operations
might be brought to an abrupt termination at any time. Should Captain
Badger become alarmed at not having received a report from his spies,
and start out to investigate, of course the result would be the
discovery of the float, and a windup of the work.

Jack, for one, was not sorry. He fancied that he had made about all the
pictures possible in that particular field, but believed there were
other submarine depths waiting to be explored, and made to live in
motion pictures, for the education and enjoyment of untold millions of
patrons of the movies.

This being the case, Jack, as a true artist, eagerly awaited the time
when they should start out to seek those new fields of adventure.
With him the finding of the long lost treasures of the sea took
second place; of far more importance was the discovery of those rare
curiosities that had, ever since the world began, been hidden from the
eyes of mortal man, but were now about to be revealed in all their
startling grandeur.

Oscar and the skipper talked matters over late into the night, when
the others had retired to their bunks. The work was still going on,
lanterns being used on the float to show the men how to carry on their
operations. By the dim light of these the diver was sent down below,
and the pump kept laboring steadily so as to give him a plentiful
supply of air.

It made a weird scene, and one Oscar would never forget. Indeed so
fascinating had it become to the boy that it was midnight before he
could tear himself away from the society of the captain, and seek his
own bunk. There he dreamed of untold treasures coming up from ocean
depths, accompanied by all manner of terrible monsters fashioned
after the manner of Chinese dragons, and those gigantic lizards of
prehistoric days, such as we see now and then fancifully sketched in
publications, or discover arranged in museums of fossil remains.

It had been arranged upon the conclusion of their work in this
particular spot at Coco Key, to seek still another Caribbean Sea
island, where their map told of a more modern sinking of a vessel
believed to carry much specie in its safe. After that they could take
their choice of numerous contemplated enterprises, even passing through
the Panama Canal, and continuing their search in the blue waters of the
Pacific Ocean.

Jack had been a strenuous backer of this last suggestion. Of course he
wanted to have a chance to capture a series of pictures dealing with
the famous waterway connecting the two oceans, and which would add more
or less spice and variety to his work.

So far as that was concerned both Ballyhoo and Oscar were quite as
enthusiastic as Jack about the project of passing through the canal.
They had heard and read so much about those wonderful locks, and
the strategical value the canal added to the defense of Uncle Sams
dominions, that it was only natural all of them should wish to see the
same with their own eyes.

When Ballyhoo, chancing to awaken, heard the steady sound of the pump
going outside, and turning on the electric current close to his hand
found that it was past seven, he gave a shout that aroused both his
mates.

Time we showed a leg, Im telling you, fellows! was the burden of his
call. I cn smell breakfast in the air, to boot, and it must be broad
daylight out there.

The pump is still wheezing, remarked Jack, which tells that theyve
kept it up steady all night long. Theyll be about played out by now,
and must have a rest.

There, its stopped working now. I wonder how many more of those jolly
bricks theyve hauled up, observed the Jones boy, as he hurriedly
proceeded to get his clothes on. From the fact of their keeping busy
while we slept I reckon they must have been meeting with some good
luck. I hope they dont weight the old tub down with the stuff so
therell be danger of her foundering. Sometimes a fellow can get too
much of a good thing; Ive been in that fix myself when they had a
party at our house, and ice cream left over.

Dont worry about that, laughed Oscar. If it comes to it the captain
can jettison heaps of stuff to make room for the ingots. Those barrels
and planks took up a lot of space, you remember. And if necessary some
of us could go back on a regular steamer.
