SCENE:
Topham watched the contest with twinkling eyes. If he had been in Italy
or France, where men are supposed to be more excitable, the scene would
not have seemed very strange to him. But that notoriously phlegmatic
Germans should work themselves into a passion over such a trifle seemed
to him amazing. He scarcely believed, however, that the quarrel would
end in actual violence; and so, though ready to aid Ferreira (Elsas
brother) if need arose, he sat still and looked on, letting a ghost of
a smile flicker across his lips.

Instantly, with bewildering abruptness the other German leaned across
the carriage, shaking his fist in the Americans face, and shouting
something which Topham did not catch, but which he instinctively knew
was insulting.

The navy officer flushed angrily, and the next moment the other
launched a blow at his face.

Topham parried and struck back shrewdly. He landed, but before he could
follow up his advantage, the other German precipitated himself upon
him, and in an instant the carriage became a pandemonium of struggling,
kicking, fighting men.

Topham was big and strong, but he had been taken unawares, and found
himself pinned down in the seat in the grasp of men stronger than he.
Ferreira, though he struggled, did so ineffectively, and both intruders
were practically free to concentrate on the American. The bout ended
with Topham and Ferreira on the floor with the two Germans sitting on
top of them, panting.

The struggle had lasted for some time, and in the momentary hush
that followed its cessation the shriek of the locomotive was heard,
whistling for a stop.

None of the four moved as the train slowed down. Then the Germans stood
up, releasing the others. We leave here, Herren, said the leader.
This is our address if you wish to carry matters further. They both
bowed, flung down their cards, and stepped out through the door that
the guard opened for them.

Left alone, Ferreira and Topham arose slowly. Topham was humiliated
and intensely angry, but he saw the futility of engaging in a further
contest at that moment. In fact, he scarcely knew what to do. The
crisis had come with such bewildering suddenness, and had been so
surprising both in its inception and its results, that it had taken
away his breath, both actually and figuratively. That such a thing
should happen in a German railway carriage, of all places in the world,
was to him almost too amazing for belief.

Meanwhile Ferreira had snatched up the cards. They shall die for
this, he hissed. Madre de Dios! But they shall die. I have friends
here. They will act for you too, Senor Topham! Come! Let us seek them!
He made as if to leave the train.

But Topham shook his head. Not for me, he declared. I dont fight
duels, not when Im on duty, anyhow. Besides, I see little cause. They
bested us fairly. Anyhow, its too late now.

As a matter of fact, the train was moving again.

The Brazilian hesitated. Then suddenly he tore the cards to pieces and
flung them out of the window. So be it, Senor! he acceded.

Topham glanced down at his clothes and found them whole, though badly
rumpled. Suddenly he started, just as he had on the steamer the night
he left New York, and thrust his hands into his inner pocket; then
dropped it weakly to his side.

At his blank look Ferreira cried out: You are hurt, senor! he
exclaimed.

Slowly the color came back to Tophams face. No! he said.
Not--not--hurt! You--you dont see an envelope--a big blue
envelope--lying around anywhere, do you? Dazedly he peered under the
seats.

Ferreira aided him. I hope it was not valuable, senor! he ventured.

Slowly Topham shook his head. Not intrinsically, he answered.
But--but it was--of great personal value to me. Those men must have
taken it. I suppose it is too late to find them?

The Brazilian looked blank. Dolt that I am! he cried. I destroyed
the cards!

Topham nodded. Probably they would be useless, anyhow, he muttered.
We will say no more about it, senor, if you will be so kind.

The rest of the trip passed uneventfully. Topham was moody and said
little, and Ferreira did not disturb him.
