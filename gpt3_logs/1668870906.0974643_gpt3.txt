Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Hello, Phil, Kelly greeted the sergeant, sure an its glad till see
yez I am; but divil take ye, cud yez not wait till I got through! I had
em jist where I wanted thim; I wur makin votes by the dozen.

Its a slashin good game for you, grumbled the sergeant; but look
at my end of it! You load em up with booze--theyll fight--my menll
pull em, an Ill have to hold em till Moran kin givem a hearin in
the mornin. Then what? Theres lots of fellows from my division here,
an I must carry that division, Kelly, I must carry it, or lose me job;
thats just how I stand. An if I put me people away in the cooler how
am I goin to do any carryin, eh?

Tut, tut, man dear, I must make meself solid wid the gang av young
fellys. Sure a drop av drinkll do thim no harm, Phil; itll make thim
feel good, thats all.

The uproar raised by Daily and his friends and Kellys display of
ready money had captured both the rowdy and the frothy elements. But
the popular young men--the members of the club for example--held aloof;
and it was these that Kelly was working for.

The stiff! exclaimed Jerry McGlory, as Kelly came back into the
barroom; he tinks if he blows his coin over the bar well fall in
line.

Look at Mart, over there, said McCarty, hes looking black about
something.

He was backcappin Murphy a while ago. Hes half lit up, and hell say
somethin to Larry afore the nights over, and Larryll slam him.

It was McGonagle that spoke, and a moment later he added:

Here he comes over! Play foxy, gents; dont give him no excuse for
bother, see?

Young Kelly approached, and with him were Daily and Foley.

How are youse, gents? saluted Martin. Its the old mans treat;
wont youse have somethin?

Were on the floor committee, said McCarty, an we aint touchin it
to-night.

Martin sneered; Daily heaved his bulging chest contemptuously and
coughed. It was Foley that spoke.

When a gent tries to be friendly wit me, announced he, I bes
friendly wit him, see? Aint that right?

It depends on the guy thats doin the stunt, answered McGonagle.

Eh, no! What tell no! Youse do it every hitch! And Foley excitedly
dramatized a scene: A gent comes up to me, and puts out his fin, see?
What do I do? Why I takes it, an puts away me medicine like a little
man! All to be sociable, see? All to be sociable!

Thats right, agreed Daily. Thats the proper ting to do. Why
yoused cut a hell of a caper, turnin down good people, wouldnt
youse.

Ah, go soak yer head, growled McGonagle. Youse guys give me a pain!
We aint suckers; we kin see a play when its made, as well as the
next.

Yousere all gents! put in Martin, sarcastically. Here that lobster
Murphy goes an turns down a lady, at the door. Im sponsible to me
friends for that, dye hear? I sold em the tickets an Im sponsible
for the game I steered em against! Aint that right?

Sure, answered Daily and Foley in a breath.

Wheres Murphy? demanded Martin. Murphys got to apologize fer
insultin Nobbys lady friend. Hes got to do it!

Its comin, said McGlory, in a low tone.

Wed better put Larry next, remarked McCarty in the same voice.
Kelly carries a jack; remember how he trowed it into Ned Hogan that
night?

Larry was dancing; he had his arm about Annie Clancys trim waist and
they swayed and spun with the music. Annies face was bright and happy;
her eyes shone like twin stars, for Larry was telling her how good a
fellow his friend McGonagle was, and that was a tale that Annie could
have listened to forever.

Word had gone about among the floor committee that Kelly was looking
for him, and Larry received mysterious nods, winks and signals. He
could make nothing of it, so he led Annie to a seat beside Miss
McTurpin, and walked over to where McGonagle, who had crossed the room,
was standing.
