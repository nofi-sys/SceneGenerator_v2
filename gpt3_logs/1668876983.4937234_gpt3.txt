THE CHALLENGE


Come in!

Starling Meyer turned from the window in Number 17 and faced the door.
Ernest Barnes, Stars roommate, looked up from his book and glanced
curiously in the same direction as the portal opened briskly to admit
Jimmy Logan. It lacked but a few minutes of study hour and Jimmy, with
the door of the next room slightly ajar, had made certain of Stars
return before starting on his errand. Beyond the partitionthere was a
connecting door between the rooms, but that was never openedDud was
dubiously awaiting Jimmys report.

Oh, said Star eloquently as Jimmy advanced jauntily enough but with a
most sober countenance into the radius of light from the study table.
Hello, Logan, what do you want?

Barnes greeting was just a nod, civil but not enthusiastic, and having
made it he went back to his book.

Hello, fellows, said Jimmy. Mind if I sit down, Meyer?

Help yourself. Star eyed the caller suspiciously. This is an
unexpected honor, he added sarcastically.

Jimmy nodded. Yes, isnt it? Fact is, Im on a painful errand, Meyer.
Mind if I speak before Barnes?

Oh, cut the comedy, Logan, replied Star impatiently. What nonsense
are you up to, anyway?

No nonsense at all, really, Jimmy assured him earnestly. Its like
this, Meyer. Im here on behalf of my friend, Baker. You see, he isnt
just satisfied with the way things were left this afternoon. He feels
thaterthe matter ought to be settled moreermore definitely. See
what I mean?

Oh, rot! Im not going to fight that kid, Logan. Hes too small. Tell
him to forget it. And look here, you! Stars voice took on an edge. I
want you to quit meddling in my affairs, too, Logan. I know what youve
been up to. You and that roommate of yours are altogether too fresh.

Me? asked Jimmy innocently. What have I done, Meyer?

Youve talked a whole lot too much, thats what youve done. And
youve egged Baker on toto make trouble. I want you to stop it, both
of you.

Well, I may have talked some, Jimmy allowed calmly. Everyone has a
right to talk

If theyre careful what they say, yes! But

Anyway, that isnt what I came to see you about. Ive talked it over
with Dud and weve concluded that you ought to give him satisfaction.
You see, Meyer, slapping a fellows face and then refusing to go on
with it lookswell, a bit funny, eh? Now what we propose is that you
and Dud meet, say tomorrow afternoon at half-past five, down at the
Beach, and settle the matter in a quiet, gentlemanly way. What do you
say to that?

I say no, replied Star shortly. I havent any intention of fighting
him. All I will do is slap his face again if he doesnt let me alone.
Hes been telling it aroundor you havethat Im afraid of him!

Um, said Jimmy thoughtfully. Wellerif you dont fight him wont
it look as if he was right?

Star flushed angrily. Dont be a fool, Logan! Id take the two of you
on and lick the tar out of you if it wasnt beneath me!

Oh, I see! Then Im to tell Dud that you refuse?

Tell him anything you like! And now you get out of here or Ill throw
you out!

Barnes had displayed a remarkable aloofness up to the present moment,
but now he raised his eyes at last from his book and judicially, even
hopefully, compared the two before him. The result of the comparison,
however, seemed to disappoint him, for he sighed and went back to his
occupation again, apparently dismissing the matter from his mind.

And what would I be doing? asked Jimmy brightly. Ill tell you
frankly, Meyer, that your attitude is a great surprise to me. Its a
great disappointment, too. Id hoped for better things, Meyer. The
fellows are going to be mightily disappointed when they hear about it.
