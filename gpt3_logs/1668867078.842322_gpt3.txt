Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
They all looked ferociously at me, expecting, no doubt, that I would
tremble with terror, as most of my class did before them; but I couldnt
tremblethe charge struck me as so ridiculous. As a matter of fact, I
am afraid that I grinned. I know I did.

What is it, asked Or-tis, that amuses you so?

The charge, I replied.

What is there funny about that? he asked againmen have been shot
for lessmen who were not suspected of treasonable acts.

I did not resist an officer in the discharge of his duty, I said. It
is not one of a tax collectors duties to put a family out of its pen at
the market place, is it?a pen they have occupied for three
generations? I ask you, Or-tis, is it?

Or-tis half rose from his chair. How dare you address me thus? he
cried.

The others turned scowling faces upon me, and beating the table with
their dirty fists they all shouted and bellowed at me at once; but I
kept my chin up as I had sworn to do until I died and I laughed in their
faces.

Finally they quieted down, and again I put my question to Or-tis and
Ill give him credit for answering it fairly. No, he said, only the
teivos may do thatthe teivos or the commandant.

Then I did not resist an officer in the discharge of his duty; I shot
back at them, for I only refused to leave the pen that is mine. And now
another question. Is a cheese a deadly weapon?

They had to admit that it was not. He demanded a present from my
father, I explained, and I brought him a cheese. He had no right under
the law to demand it, and so I threw it at him and it hit him in the
face. I shall deliver thus every such illegal tithe that is demanded of
us. I have my rights under the law and I intend to see that they are
respected.

They had never been talked to thus before, and suddenly I realized that
by merest chance I had stumbled upon the only way in which to meet these
creatures. They were moral as well as physical cowards. They could not
face an honest, fearless manalready they were showing signs of
embarrassment. They knew that I was right, and while they could have
condemned me had I bowed the knee to them they hadnt the courage to do
it in my presence.

The natural outcome was that they sought a scape goat, and Or-tis was
not long in finding onehis baleful eye alighted upon Soor.

Does this man speak the truth? he cried at the tax collector. Did you
turn him out of his pendid he do no more than throw a cheese at you?

Soor, a coward before those in authority over him, flushed and
stammered.

He tried to kill me, he mumbled lamely, and he did almost kill
Brother Vonbulen.

Then I told them of thatand always I spoke in a tone of authority and
I held my ground. I did not fear them and they knew it. Sometimes I
think they attributed it to some knowledge I had of something that might
be menacing themfor they were always afraid of revolution. That is why
they ground us down so.

The outcome of it was that I was let go with a warninga warning that
if I did not address my fellows as Brother I would be punished, and even
then I gave the parting shot, for I told them I would call no man
Brother unless he was.

The whole affair was a farce; but all trials were farces, only as a rule
the joke was on the accused. They were not conducted in a dignified or
proper manner as I imagine trials in ancient times to have been. There
was neither order nor system.

I had to walk all the way homeanother manifestation of justiceand I
arrived there an hour or two after supper time. I found Jim and Mollie
and Juana at the house, and I could see that Mother had been crying. She
started again when she saw mepoor Mother. I wonder if it has always
been such a terrible thing to be a mother; but no, it cannot have been,
else the human race would long since have been extinctas the Kalkars
will rapidly make it anyway.

Jim had told them of the happenings in the market placethe episode of
the bull, the encounter with Vonbulen and the matter of Soor. For the
first time in my life, and the only time, I heard my Father laugh aloud.
Juana laughed, too; but there was still an undercurrent of terror that I
could feel, and which Mollie finally voiced.
