SCENE:
It was me, said Michael. I squeaked, but Aunt Rosamund held my mouf.

Then, said John, _you_ are the fairies?

It is our _cache_, quoth Antony magnificently.

So I am beginning to perceive, responded John. But why, if I may
ask without undue curiosity, is Molly in the matter? I imagined it
was Molly. And, if all accounts be correct, she would appear hardly a
subject for especial favours.

Rosamunds eyes danced. John had a mental image of sunlight suddenly
sparkling on still waters.

It is just, she explained, that she appears, as you say, hardly a
subject for favours, that she gets them.

Oh! John was frankly a trifle bewildered by the explanation.

It was Tonys idea, smiled Rosamund.

She had seated herself on the heather, and John had followed her
example. The boys were some paces ahead of them, examining the _cache_.

Tony, pursued Rosamund, discovered that pleasant anticipation is
conducive to good behaviour. He solemnly assured me of the fact one
day. Therefore we--or, at least, I--conceived the idea of putting the
theory to the test.

Therefore, said John, you established a _cache_ for Molly.

We established a _cache_ for Molly, echoed she. We lured her to it
in the most innocent way imaginable. Of course she hasnt the remotest
notion as to who has established it. That would be to spoil the joy of
it. It is the hint of secret magic about it that is half its delight.
The contents are dependent on conduct, you understand. At least a
fortnights exemplary behaviour brings the kind of reward you perceived
today. Often there may be merely a flower found. If the fairies are
dissatisfied, I have known them to put a couple of snails within the
_cache_. Again her eyes danced.

Brown pools that have caught and held a sunbeam, thought John.

Aloud he said ruminatively, I wonder what becomes of the snails.

Rosamund gave a little shiver.

I fear me, said she, that once at least, they were--squashed!

Hum! quoth John. I have an idea that if I were seeking--say a rose,
and found a snail instead, that the snail might possibly be subjected
to a like fate.

But it wasnt the poor snails fault, she objected.

We have frequently, said John sententiously, to suffer for the sins
of others. If I might offer a suggestion, I would point out that the
fairies displeasure might be equally well marked by coal, stones, or
even a copybook maxim. How does Be good and youll be happy, or
Gifts are the reward of virtue, strike you?

She shook her head.

Fairies, she assured him, never indulge in moral reflections. They
merely act.

Deeds, not words, being their motto, laughed John. But coal, now!

Yes, she conceded, I think coal might answer our purpose.

There was a little pause.

To a mere casual observer, remarked John reflectively, the young
person in question might have appeared an embryo saint. From which we
perceive the truth of the adage that appearances are deceitful.

Not in every case, she retorted. How do you know that she isnt an
embryo saint? Very much in embryo, Ill allow. Oh, but theres stuff in
Molly. But do you suppose shes understood among the village folk? Not
a bit of it! Its respectability they admire, wooden respectability.

Hum, said John.

And Molly isnt wooden.

No, acquiesced John fervently.

Rosamund laughed.

And therefore, she continued, they see downright sin in her--well,
her unwooden escapades. And they havent a notion, the faintest notion
of her possibilities.
