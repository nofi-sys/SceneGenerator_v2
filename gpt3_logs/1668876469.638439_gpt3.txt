SCENE:
Have it your own way! she said. But, Chester, youre foolish! Dont
you know that Germany would give a million pounds out of the Spandau
Towerto keep England and the States from solving the cipher? It means
Germanys financial ruin in the dye industries. The world learned how to
make potash, during the warit hasnt learned how to make good dyes
cheaply. The whole thing is in that cipher.

I saw it, Saidee. There were hundreds and hundreds of sheets of paper
with letters on them. The letters seemed to be groupedthree to a
group.

Oh, I worked on it. We all worked on it! I even got little Danny Nugent
from Soho to try his hand. Remember Danny? He used to stay awake nights
working out ciphers so the police couldnt read them. He says the dye
cipher is impossiblethat it follows no known rule.

Sir Richard told me that, said Fay. Well, we got the answer, he
added, glancing keenly around. We got it, Saidee, and were going to
deliver it in person. We

She clutched his arm at that moment.

What is that moving up the canal? she asked tensely. See it, Chester!
Is it a boat, close to the bank?

He drew her down and stared through the latticed bars of the
summer-house. A shadow moved within the banks shadow. A ripple showed
like the gleam of a silver wing. Sounds of oars in locks floated to
them. Then, and suddenly, all was still. A murky billow rolled over the
lowland and blotted out the canal from view.

He reached and drew the bags to him. He thrust his fingers within a
crack and lifted a sodden plank. Leaves and moss were beneath the
flooring. A toad hopped away.

Theres room here, he said, pressing down the two bags. Well come
back for them when we find a ship.

Replacing the plank, he rose and stared toward where he had seen the
shadow. The fog had thickened. He could see nothing save the dark
surface of the canal.

They crossed to the shore, after he had closed the little bridge with
the board. They glanced back, then hurried on toward the Schwartz Canal.
The pathway they took was winding and long.

It was a mile below where they had first crossed the Canal in a boat,
before he stopped and pointed ahead.

A ship, he said. See the masts?

They went on through the lowland path and came to a bridge. The draw was
closed. Burgers and lorries passed from bank to bank. The smell of fish
and clams was in the air. The fog had not yet cleared from the surfaces.
Above the fog, windmills and spires showed in spectral outlines.

Fay led the way to the gangplank of the ship. He paused there and
studied its outlines. It was a rusty tramp, engaged in the North Sea
trade. Its one funnel bore the Blue-D mark of the Holland line. A row of
white doors on the boat deck indicated that passengers were carried.

He told Saidee Isaacs to wait as he turned and climbed up the plank. A
sovereign pressed into the hand of a Dutch steward, who stood at the
head of the plank, gained an instant ear. Fay took two staterooms on the
starboard side after ascertaining that the ship would steam within an
hour, and that her destination would be Stavanger, with Lemvig, in
Denmark, as a port of call.

You go aboard and wait, he said as he descended the plank and moved to
her side. Ill get the bags and be right back. The ship sails in an
hour for Stavanger. From there we can double to Scotland by the Aberdeen
Line. From Aberdeen we can catch the Royal Scotch Mail for London.

Be careful, was all she said as she started up the plank.

He hurried back to the bridge, crowded between two burgers who were
carrying nets, and gained the opposite bank of the canal. He took the
path with his head held high, his arms down at his sides. The fog was
thick. There were sounds ahead, of creaking windmills and of lowland
cattle.

He went on, picking the dry places between the puddles. He came to a
marsh with white stones in a row, across it. The fog hung heavily. The
way ahead was through a clinging veil.

Suddenly a whistle shrilled the damp air. A blare sounded behind him.
Fay leaped to the bank of the marsh and started running down the narrow
path which would take him to the plank bridge and the little
summer-house where the bags were.
