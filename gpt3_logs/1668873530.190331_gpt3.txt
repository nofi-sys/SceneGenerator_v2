SCENE:
Donald, too, was becoming interested, and forgot the humorous side of
the spectacle. When his eyes again sought Esthers, to his surprise he
found them fixed and vacant, her face unusually pale and rigid. He
noticed, too, that the small, brown hand he held felt cold and
unnatural. Glancing from her to Russell he saw the man looking fixedly
at her. Then the Professor arose, and passing to Esthers side moved his
hands several times before her face, though without touching her. He
then took a handkerchief from one of the gentlemen and bound it tightly
over her eyes, closely shutting out every ray of light.

I think, my friends, he said, as he placed several chairs in the
unoccupied space of the room, we shall prove that, though Esther cannot
see with mortal vision, there are spirit forms about her who will direct
her course and thus demonstrate their presence.

All sat in hushed expectancy until Esther, rising from her chair, glided
like a phantom to the middle of the floor, and humming a soft, slow
waltz, she floated about the room, avoiding the chairs and other
articles in her way without losing step or breaking time in the least.

It was wonderful. Mark would have been staggered in his scepticism had
he not seen the same performance once enacted by a subject in the hands
of a noted mesmerist.

This is only further proof of the scheming falseness of that villain
Russell, he reflected. It shall not be my fault if he is not banished
from my house from this day forth. If he would only attribute his power
to the right source I could endure him, but spiritsbah!

For ten minutes the girl waltzed without interruption, then, as if led
by unseen hands, she passed from the room and threw herself, apparently
exhausted, upon a small lounge in the adjoining apartment.

She has been dancing with a stronger partner than herself and got tired
out, said Russell coarsely. Well let her rest a while.

When the company was again seated in the circle Mark slipped out and
removed the handkerchief from the eyes of the prostrate girl. Her face
was chalky in its pallor, and there was scarcely a perceptible evidence
of respiration.

My God! How like death this is, muttered Mark as he bent over her. If
she were my daughter she should never come into the presence of that man
again. Then he strove to waken her.

Esther, Esther, he said, shaking her gently by the arm. Awake! But
not a muscle of the rigid face relaxed. He lifted her hands and slightly
punctured the smooth flesh with a pin. She did not wince nor show that
she felt it. Again and again he sought to arouse her. Mark was beginning
to fear that the sleep was one which would find its awakening in another
world, when Russell entered the room.

You can see the result of your spirit-waltz, Professor, he said.

Russell placed his hand upon the girls brow.

Ah, yes, she has been taking a fine nap after it. But she is waking up
now. Come, Esther, aint it about time for you to come out to see us
again? Im afraid youre a sleepy-head. Come, youre awake now! and
laughing coarsely, Professor Russell returned to the company.

Esther, to Marks delight, arose to a sitting posture, passed her hands
several times over her eyes as if striving to collect her thoughts, and
seeing only Mark present, asked plaintively:

What is it, Mr. Cramer? Where am I? What has happened? She looked
about the room in a bewildered way. Then, as the sound of voices from
the adjoining apartment fell upon her ear she turned, and burying her
face upon the lounge burst into hysterical weeping.

Mark sprang to her side.

Dont Esther, child! Dont cry! What is the matter?

O Mr. Cramer, have I been dancing again? Has that horrible, horrible
man made me a waltzing puppet for the people to laugh at? It is too
dreadful! What shall I do? What shall I do?

I am sure there was nothing ridiculous or laughable in your dancing,
for it was really artistic; but truly, Esther, are you entirely
unconscious when you perform that feat?

Indeed I am. I could not believe them when they told me about it the
first time I danced that way. This time it seemed when I awoke as if I
had been dreaming of dancing or of hearing dance-music. _He_ makes me do
it, that horrible man! I am sure the spirits have nothing to do with
it.

Your hands are placed some of the time as though dancing with a
partner.
