Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
The count flung up his hand. No! No! Think once more, senorita, he
pleaded.

I can not. I have--

Then, senorita, I must take other measures. I have given you every
chance, and you have refused. Now--Now!

The man did not even raise his voice. In exactly the same tones as
those he had been using, he repeated his last word Now!

Vaguely uneasy; fearing she knew not what, Lillian started to rise.
But before she could do so, a towel saturated with some heavy-smelling
stuff, was flung over her face from behind, and her head was drawn
suddenly back. Vainly she tried to scream; the muffling towel was too
thick. She gasped for breath, plucking with futile fingers at the
bandage. Then her brain reeled; and darkness came over her.

Ouro Preto stood silently, quietly watching her struggles. When at last
she lay still he spoke in a low tone to the sailor who held her.

Loosen the towel a little and give her air, he ordered. I dont want
to suffocate her.

As the man obeyed the count stepped to the taffrail, and stared back
to where the lights of his yacht gleamed through the darkness. After
a moment he lifted the rear light of the steamer from its box, and
swung it in wide wagon wheel convolutions--swung it until from out of
the waters behind him a white sword of light sprang up and cleft the
zenith. Right and left it wheeled, cutting fantastic zigzags across the
milky way, but never by any chance falling upon the Southern Cross.

His yacht had hung on the heels of the Southern Cross all the way from
Barbadoes, until those upon the steamer had ceased to pay attention
to her. On that particular night she had closed in until scarcely an
eighth of a mile of smooth rolling water separated the two vessels.
When the search light sprang up, the officers on the Southern Cross
watched it for a moment and then turned to more important things,
neither noting nor caring that the yacht was rapidly eating up the
distance that had separated her from them.

Meanwhile Ouro Preto was busy. From a rack above his head he took two
life preservers; one he bound around himself, and the other he handed
to his confederate to fasten around Miss Byrds unconscious form.

Come along, he ordered, turning to the starboard quarter, whence a
trailing rope ladder--a so-called Jacobs ladder--depended, its lower
end just touching the crests of the waves as they rolled past.

He climbed over the rail and took a step or two down the swaying
ladder. Give me the girl, he ordered.

But the man held back. Say, Mister, he protested. I aint standing
for no murder.

Ouro Preto glared at him. Neither am I, you fool, he snarled. Its
all arranged. I can swim like a fish, and my yacht will pick us up in
less than five minutes. See how near she is.

The man looked up. The yacht was indeed very near.

Give me the girl, ordered the count, again, and this time the sailor
obeyed.

Ouro Preto balanced Lillian over his shoulder and descended the Jack
ladder step by step. When he reached the waters edge he stopped.

Swing the light around your head twice, he called, softly.

The sailor obeyed and instantly the yachts searchlight crept along
the water until it rested with sudden brilliancy on the stern of the
Southern Cross and on Ouro Preto where he clung to the Jacobs ladder
with Lillian in his arms.

For only an instant he clung; then he descended the last two or three
steps of the ladder and when the next wave came let go his hold and
dropped upon its crest.

The fall carried the two beneath the surface, but the life preservers
brought them up again as quickly as a bobbing cork. In the interval,
brief as it was, the Southern Cross had drawn away; the count could
see her stern light rapidly lessening in the distance. The yachts
searchlight came and went, sweeping over him often enough to prevent
his being lost in the waters, but not often enough to attract belated
attention from the Southern Cross.

Then Lillian revived, drawn back to life by the shock of the chill
water. Half conscious, bewildered, terror stricken, she struggled
desperately to free herself from the count and he let her go for an
instant only to grasp hold of her life belt again as a wave tried to
force them apart.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The count tries to convince Lillian to stay with him, but when she refuses he chloroforms her and ties her to a life preserver. He throws her overboard and follows her into the water, where the yacht's searchlight finds them. They are eventually picked up by the yacht.
