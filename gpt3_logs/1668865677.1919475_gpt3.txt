Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
I will now. You can trust me. Mr. Williams, you can see how it was. I
couldnt sleep and my mind was full of this awful thing, and I thought
if I could put it on something else--get free from my thoughts even for
a few minutes!

Williams grunted his comprehension. He felt rather tenderly toward her,
she looked so small and wan and her voice was so pleading.

Where was your book? he asked.

On the table behind you. I was feeling round for it and I think I
pushed it off with the lamp.

What was the name of it?

_Victory_, by Joseph Conrad.

He went to the table. His back turned, she and Bassett exchanged a long
look. Williams picked up the book and came back with it.

Here it is, he said, giving it to her. And just make a note of the
fact that youre not to go round the house at night after books or
anything else.

She assured him she would not, she would give them no more trouble,
and opening the door she slipped away. They remained without speaking
till she came out on the gallery and walked to her room. Bassett stood
looking up after she had disappeared, the memory of her face as they
burst in upon her added a new peculiar distress to his harrowed state.

Well, said Williams, her book _was_ there.

Bassett stared at him:

_Was_ there! Why shouldnt it be?

Williams gave an upward hitch of his shoulders:

Words come easy, Mr. Bassett.

Good God! exclaimed Bassett in horrified amaze. You have any idea
she was _lying_? If you have, get it out of your head. Ive known Miss
Tracy for three years and she could no more say what wasnt true
than--well, she _couldnt_, thats all.

I dont think she did. It sounded to me a perfectly straight story.

It was. You can take my word for that.

They were back in the library when Rawson reappeared with Shine. Shine,
unable to sleep, had been sitting by his window when Rawson, scouting,
had stopped to inquire if he had seen any one. Shine had not, but had
volunteered to join in a hunt and the two had been about the house and
the immediate vicinity. Nothing had been discovered and Patrick had
seen no sign of life or heard no sound. Now they had come back for
the electric torch and were going to extend their search. A person
concealed on the seaward side of the island might be moving at this
hour when the causeway was free. Bassett said he would go with them and
the three men left the room by one of the long windows.

Williams opened the library door and turned off the lights. The noise
of the departing trio would suggest to any one on the watch that the
house was free of police supervision and there might be developments.
He took the desk chair as easier to rise from than the deep-seated
leather ones and settled himself to a _resum_ of what they had so far
gathered.

He was convinced of Mrs. Stokes guilt and ran over the reasons. A
hysterical woman, frantic with jealousy--that alone was enough. But
that woman had been the only member of the party who at the time of
the shooting had been some distance from the house. She had taken the
pistol with the intention of using it if an occasion offered. Her walk
had been undertaken with the hope that she might find that occasion
in the hour before supper when they were all in their rooms. The
occasion _had_ offered. Miss Saunders, unable to resist the beauty of
the evening, had gone to the Point alone. He set no store by Rawsons
opinion that the womans state of mind was too genuinely distracted.
He considered it as part of a premeditated plan carried through with
nerve and skill. She would have known that the report of the pistol
would have been heard at the house. This, when Miss Saunders did not
return, would have suggested foul play. And she, Mrs. Stokes, was the
only person out on the island. A later entrance, with an assumption of
ignorance, would have turned suspicion on her like a pointing finger.
She was too intelligent for that--had called her abilities as an
actress to her aid and put them all off with her screaming excitement.

Another point that he wanted to look into was the length of time she
had been at the shore after the report--a great deal too long for what
she said she had done. Too paralyzed to think or move, her explanation
was stunned. Williams was divided in his opinion as to that--either
pulling herself together for the grand-stand play she was to make or
possibly pushing the body into the water.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Mrs. Stokes is the only person out on the island when Miss Saunders is shot. She is too intelligent to make a later entrance and turn suspicion on herself, so she uses her acting skills to pretend she is too excited to think or move. However, Williams is suspicious of her story because she takes too long to return to the house after the shot is fired.
