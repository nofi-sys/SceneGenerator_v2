SCENE:
He is ashamed to do so, Annie. But he is grateful to you all the same.
He often talks to me about the sacrifices you must have made, and he
thinks of them a great deal, I am sure.

But that is not enough. He ought to speak to me about them, and, if he
is too shy to do so by letter, I must hear him express his gratitude
in person. Where is he living, Stephen? I must have his address, said
Annie, with determination.

I cant give it you--I cant indeed. I was afraid you would want to
know it, and he has forbidden me to give it you; that is why I have
kept away from you.

And what reason have you both to give for this very singular refusal?
What is Harry doing that he is ashamed to be seen by his own wife?

He is not ashamed exactly; but he knows how proud you are, and he
thinks, if you knew how he earns his living, you would look down upon
him.

Is it something so very disgraceful then?

Perhaps you might call it so; at least he thinks so.

Tell me what it is. Stephen, do tell me.

I cant. I swore to him I wouldnt.

Then am I never to know? Doesnt he want ever to see me again?

Some day, but not yet.

But what difference can waiting make? If it is disgraceful now, it
will always be disgraceful. But, if it is only that he has taken
to earning his living by some employment not generally filled by
gentlemen, why, I shall only respect him the more for sacrificing his
pride! That is true indeed.

But all her arguments and entreaties did not move Stephen, who seemed
very much agitated by her supplications, but doggedly refused to yield
to them.

That night she wrote a letter to her husband, sending it as usual to
Stephen to be forwarded.

MY DEAR HARRY,--After waiting impatiently for more tidings of you
than your scanty notes convey, I caught Stephen to-day, much against
his will, and hoped to get him to give me your address, that I might
come and see you. But nothing would induce him to tell me where you
are or what you are doing, and he says you have strictly forbidden him
to do so. I now appeal to you to put an end to the anxiety I am in
about you, and to let me come and see you, if you will not come and
see me. Stephen seems to think that you are afraid that the way you
are earning your living will shock me; but indeed I think, if I were
to see you with a black face after sweeping a chimney, or driving a
donkey-cart full of vegetables, you would not complain of the coldness
of the welcome I would give you. Please, please write to me, not one
of those little hurried scrawls saying nothing, but a letter just to
tell me when I am to see you again. I dont think you would be jealous
of anybody I see now, except perhaps of dear old George, whom I see
nearly every day, and whom I should like much better if only he would
do something, like you. I know you hate writing; but you would find
time for this if only you knew how anxious I am to be sure you are
well.

Your loving wife,

ANNIE.

She posted this letter under cover to Stephen; but she waited three
weeks without getting any answer.

At the end of that time she was surprised by a visit from Lilian, who
had just returned with her husband from abroad, having been traveling
some months for her health, which had broken down. She was much touched
by her sister-in-laws kindness to George, who had dined with Mr.
Falconer and herself the night before, and had represented Annie as the
guardian angel of the family.

Wilfred has come up to town, and he was with us too, said Lilian.
And he talks of you just as well, and wants to come and see you, but
he doesnt dare. You are a good little thing, Annie, to keep so staid
now when every one is talking about you, and when Harry has treated you
so badly.

Who told you that? said Annie, sharply.

George. But never mind; you mustnt be angry with him or with me. What
has become of Mr. Cooke? she asked, in a low voice.
