Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
XVIII


JEAN had told Margot that the one thing he would never forgive was
interference in his concerns. No friend, he had explained, had the
right to force upon him such an indignity. One might willingly consent
to being under an obligation to a friend, but to receive a compulsory
and unconscious benefit behind ones back was a wound to the personal
honour which nothing could ever heal.

Such service was worse than enmity; it was more intimate and less
forgivable.

Margot listened humbly to this statement of Jeans views; she thought
how noble he was; and then it occurred to her that he need never find
out.

After all, the great thing was that Jean should be helped, and Margot
had never felt that it was at all necessary she should be noble. Jean
was Jean, but when you came to think of it, it was almost a moral
convenience that Margot was only Margot.

On the day after Jeans disastrous proposal of marriage Margot
mysteriously left him. She said she had occasion to take the air--and
she took it, after having made a toilette peculiarly ambitious for so
simple a purpose. Jean was not, of course, offended with Margot; at the
same time he was sufficiently hurt to evince no curiosity. She had not
broken his heart, but there would have been something inappropriate in
his expressing any wish to know why she wore her best hat and did her
hair in the most complicated manner.

He satisfied himself, therefore, with looking extremely depressed, and
watching which direction she took from the window. At the corner she
stopped to buy two crimson roses and pinned them six inches under her
chin; it was almost the last franc of the best bedstead money.

Monsieur Cartier had returned to Paris, and Margot sent her name up to
his handsome rooms through the medium of a low-voiced, velvet-footed
manservant--while she waited trembling at the door. She wrote on the
card, I want urgently to see you, Monsieur Jeans friend, Margot
Selba.

The great Monsieur Cartier was a good-natured man; he was also curious.

All of Lianes friends knew the name of Mademoiselle Selba almost as
well as Lianes enemies knew it, but Cartier was probably the only one
of them who had no intention of dropping the young musician because of
it.

Lianes wrongs did not matter nearly so much to him as Jeans touch on
the piano--he considered, and he was an excellent authority, that Jean
DUcelles had a very pretty touch and an idea or two behind it, while
it had not occurred to him that Lianes wrongs shared in either of
these delicate qualities.

Well, Mademoiselle, he exclaimed, as Margot was announced, of course
I remember you--you had no need to announce yourself as a friend of
Jeans. It is a pleasure to see you. I read a charming account of one
of your successes in the _Journal_ the other day. You stand on your own
feet now, and Jean, I hope, continues to remain at them?

Thank you, Monsieur, replied Margot, with a neat little bow. It is
of Monsieur Jean that I came to speak to you.

Cartier pulled forward one of his big leather armchairs in which
Margots tiny figure was almost lost. She continued, however, to behave
with as much dignity and assurance as if she were six feet tall and had
been born in the Tuileries. She had never been in such a big room in
her life, and her feet didnt quite touch the floor--but no one would
ever have supposed so to look at her.

Whats the young scapegrace been doing? asked Cartier genially. If
he has not been practising four hours a day he had better avoid meeting
me, thats all! A genius that doesnt work is like a blood-horse with
a broken wind--all very fine for the preliminary canter, but good for
nothing after the first fence. You dont come here with tales like
that, I hope, Mademoiselle?

Oh, Monsieur, exclaimed Margot, first, before I tell you anything,
promise me never to let him know that I have been here!

Mademoiselle, laughed Cartier, I am discretion itself. No one shall
ever know of it! Has he become a _Barbe Bleue, le petit_ Jean, in my
absence?

Then Margot told him. It was a long story, in spite of which there was
a good deal left out of it.

Cartier followed it attentively, twisting his gold-rimmed glasses to
and fro, and shaking his foot in a certain vexation of spirit. He did
not like to hear of suffering, and it was of suffering Margot told him.
Jeans suffering, of course, his poverty, his heroism, his endurance;
it lost nothing from Margots lips; only it appeared that she herself
had taken no part in it. And the worst of it is, Monsieur Cartier,
she finished, that he is so proud; the best men always are, I think!
It would be so difficult, you cant think how difficult, to help him!
The artists he used to play for no longer offer him work; perhaps,
Monsieur, you may have heard that he displeased Madame de Brances.
If she had only known, there was nothing in it at all; but we cannot
expect a lady like that to believe----


BRIEF OUTLINE:

==========

In Scene XVIII of the play, Margot tells Cartier about Jean's recent struggles and how proud he is. She explains that it is difficult to help him because he is so proud. Cartier listens attentively and is sympathetic.
