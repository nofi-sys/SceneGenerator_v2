Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
She rose and lighted it herself, rather reluctantly. She would have
preferred that the interrogation she would have to submit to should
have been made in the twilight. However, he was not in a mood to be
argued with, so she sat down again in the gas-light, with some work in
her hand.

You dont want that for a few minutes, said her husband, taking from
her hands the stage-cap she was making. I want you to look at me.

So she submitted again, with a shrug of the shoulders and a little,
contemptuous laugh, which was rather forced, and raised her restless,
dark eyes to his steady, blue ones, with an affectation of indifference
which did not even irritate him.

Wont you sit down? I cant look at you without cricking my neck while
you stand towering above me like that! said she.

Thank you. I dont think I could sit down here quietly with you until
I was a little more sure than I am of the footing on which I am here,
returned Harry; and, for the first time, she noticed a nervous movement
of his left hand.

He stepped back from her a little, however, so that she could see his
face without inconvenience, and she noticed that he looked thin, that
he had lost his bright color, and that the steady, set expression of
his face made him look much older than when she had left the Grange.

I dont understand you! Please let me know clearly what cause of
complaint you have against me that makes you behave in such a strange
manner to me, said Annie haughtily.

But she was not quite at ease; this character of culprit was new to
her, and it did not sit so well upon her as the equally unaccustomed
character of judge seemed to sit upon her husband.

Who was that man I met outside your door just now?

Mr. Aubrey Cooke, a man who was acting at the Regency Theater when
I was there. You must have heard me speak of him as one of my oldest
friends upon the stage.

One of your oldest friends? That is what he called himself. But the
servant told me he was a relative of yours, who came to see you nearly
every day.

I am not answerable for the creations of a housemaids fancy.
Certainly neither Mr. Cooke nor I ever told her he was a relative of
mine.

But he comes to see you nearly every day?

Not so often as that; but he comes very frequently. Why should he not?
I am at liberty to choose my own friends, and he is one of the best I
have.

Then why did you not introduce him to me just now when you came out of
your room and found us both there?

I was too much taken by surprise----

And terror--that is what your face showed.

I thought you had had some quarrel, you looked so angry; I did not
know what to think; and the next minute Mr. Cooke was gone.

It was the first time he had heard you were married, was it not?

Annie hesitated for one moment; then she said:

He always knew me as Miss Langton, like the rest of my theatrical
friends. I dont know whether he had heard I was married----

That is a lie, Annie! he burst out, with a suddenness which made her
start. You silly woman, why dont you tell me the truth? For the truth
I will have; and, if I have to get it from anybody but you, it will be
the worse for you and for him too.

Annies gaze sunk under the fierceness which blazed in his eyes and
recalled to her mind his old savagery at the Grange. He lowered his
voice again as he saw her shrink.

Annie, dont let me fancy you have anything to tell me worse than
I have thought, said he, with a tremor in his voice. You need not
be afraid of me; I will listen calmly to whatever you have to say. I
havent always been a good husband to you, and I feel it quite as much
as you do. But I have been fond of you, and good to you lately, and you
might trust me a little, if only for the sake of that. Now tell me! You
do like this Mr. Cooke, dont you?

Yes, of course I like him, or I should not let him come and see me.
