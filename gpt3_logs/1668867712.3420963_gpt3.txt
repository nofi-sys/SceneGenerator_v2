SCENE:
XIX BLOCKING THE GAME OF BADGER


Heres a pretty kettle of fish! declared Jack, in a disgusted tone.

To think that wed have to run across that duffer right here in the
canal locks, Ballyhoo went on to say gloomily. What if those two old
filibusters get to scrapping while were neighbors here for a while?
It might mean the finish of our fine little cruise; for if anything
happened to knock Captain Shooks out of the running theres no one else
could manage this queer old tub.

Wed have to take charge, pay off the crew, ship the cargo home, and
then store the submarine down here in some boatyard until the company
decided what to do with her, said Oscar decidedly; but whats the
use crossing a bridge before we come to it? The two skippers may not
exchange a single word, knowing how theyd get in a fighting humor in
consequence.

It turned out that Ballyhoo was wrong in guessing they would have to
remain in the lock all night. With such magical artificial illumination
as was afforded by the numerous electric lights scattered along both
sides of the great walls, work could be carried on just as well during
the hours of night as in the daytime.

It was not long afterwards when water began to come into the lock, and
both boats commenced to rise toward the higher levels. The boys could
see that their craft was an object of great curiosity to the entire
crew of the steam yacht, for a group of sailors gathered along the side
to watch them.

Something caused the trio of boys to go ashore in order to observe at
close hand the working of the magnificent machinery by which the locks
were controlled. Jack hoped that on the return trip they would be
passing through here by daylight, for he must secure a set of pictures
that would show just how the conditions were.

Evidently strict orders had been given to the crew of the other boat,
for there was none of the customary interchange of salutations and
jokes, such as might be expected. Those men knew who those aboard the
submarine were. They possibly labored under the impression that they
had been cheated out of more or less prize money by Captain Shooks
shrewd policy in getting ahead of them on two occasions. Hence they
felt a bitter animosity toward the crew of the _Argonaut_, and it was
well for the sake of peace in the Canal Zone that the rivals were kept
apart.

When the time came for their release from the lock, the boys hastened
to once more get aboard. The captain was sitting on the little deck
above the conning tower. Oscar believed he was holding some sort of
weapon in his hands, though he could not be quite sure about this, for
the skipper hastened to conceal whatever he had there.

The expected storm didnt break, eh, lads? he remarked, as they
joined him.

If you mean trouble with those other chaps, Ballyhoo quickly said,
were just shaking hands with ourselves that nothing happened. Weve
heard some one whooping things up aboard the other boat, which we kind
of imagine must have been Captain Badger. The men seemed to jump every
time he shouted anything, and its plain to be seen theyre afraid of
him when his mad is up.

Yes, he was always reckoned a terror, admitted the skipper, between
his set teeth; and Ive half expected to be favored with a visit from
him. But the sight of those boys in khaki along the walls of the lock
must have kept him from bothering us.

But what about after we pass out of the lock, Captain? remarked
Ballyhoo; it strikes me there may be places along the canal, or in the
big lake weve got to pass through, where he might give us trouble,
such as ramming into us, and claiming it was a sheer accident?

Ive thought of all that, the other admitted, and when we pass out I
mean to tie up here close by, and spend the balance of the night within
touch of these same U. S. regulars. Then if we have any trouble, we can
look to them for assistance.

Somehow the boys all approved of this idea. It seemed both reasonable
and prudent in their eyes. While ready at all times to defend
themselves, as every American should, if they wish to maintain their
self-respect, all the same they did not believe in going around with a
chip on their shoulder, and inviting an attack.

So they remained there on the upper deck, watching all that took place.
The boys knew that after the crew of the _Dauntless_ had dispersed to
their quarters, at the command of their captain, others were constantly
watching the submarine. They could see dim figures flitting back and
forth, and acting as though they were desirous of remaining under cover.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with the three main characters - Jack, Ballyhoo, and Oscar - discussing the appearance of Captain Badger on the canal locks. They are worried that he may cause trouble for them, especially if he finds out that they are staying in the lock for the night.
Captain Shooks is also on deck, and the boys notice that he seems to be holding some sort of weapon. He tells them that he is not worried about Captain Badger, and that he is prepared to defend the Argonaut if necessary.
The rest of the night passes without incident, and in the morning the boys watch as the Argonaut is released from the lock. They see the crew of the Dauntless watching them, and they remark on how afraid they seem of their captain.
Captain Shooks decides to tie up close to the lock for the rest of the day, in case they have any trouble. The boys approve of this idea, and they spend the day on deck, keeping an eye on the Dauntless.
