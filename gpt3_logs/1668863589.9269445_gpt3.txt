What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Madame rose to her feet and held out her hand to Jean.

But this is Louis, she said, as the fat little Flaubert entered,
rubbing his beautifully manicured hands softly together, and smiling
more than ever--his most agreeable elastic smile.

What will you say to me, Louis? she said, with a light caressing
familiarity which contrasted greatly with the little air of respect and
consideration she had shown to Jean. When you hear that I have been
talking all this time and not once mentioned business? Perhaps you will
not be surprised, however. You know, she added, turning to Jean, my
husband and Monsieur Flaubert are always laughing at me; I forget the
point of everything; but I say to them--Well, after all, is a point
always a pleasant thing that one should remember it? Never come to me
for business, Monsieur DUcelles, but for anything else, Madame held
out her little soft white hand and pressed his gently, I think you
know you may command me. And now _au revoir_.

_Au revoir_, Madame, said Jean, and a million, million thanks for
all your kindness.

Without a sound the violets and the soft grey shining dress and the
delicate golden hair vanished from the silver room into the bronze.
The two men left alone together exchanged a long, challenging look.
Jean did not feel particularly attracted towards his companion. Louis
Flaubert looked a little like a round birthday-cake with too much pink
icing on the top.

Madame is always gay! always gay! Flaubert said after a moments
pause. _Maintenant, Monsieur, parlons de vos affaires; elles vous
sourient en ce moment._

Jean sat down and listened attentively to what Flaubert put before him.
It appeared that Toriallis connection was enormous and his every hour
pressed to overflowing. He could only take the best and most important
of the pupils who applied to him.

The best from the point of view of art, Flaubert explained. That
you will find is the great point here, Monsieur; we make nothing of
success or of material value here! We are, as it were, in a world
beyond all that--but for art to preserve its purity we slave! I have
had myself to take many of the pupils of Torialli--I am over-weighted
with work; of course, I have the advantage that I know the system. Yes,
I may say that for myself the system has become a part of me--and I
have almost become a part of the system. I refer, of course, to the
production of the voice; it is what we refer to chiefly here. You
will find yourself in a positive factory for the human voice in all
its stages and conditions. For a young man with musical talents and
a career to make, I think, I dont say lightly, that the advantages
are simply inestimable. There is much of the work, however, which is
not purely technical. You will find out all that later--appointments
to make--business letters to write--concerts to arrange for--all
these things will be invaluable for your future experience. They will
introduce you to the necessary workings of public life. You will, of
course, accompany regularly my pupils, and from time to time when I
am unavoidably detained about the management of affairs--and I must
tell you this often happens, for Torialli is, like Madame, an artist
pure and simple--you will, of course, hold yourself in readiness to
accompany for him. What you will learn then, I need not say, is an
opportunity many men in Paris would give their heads for!

Jean gratefully acknowledged the splendour of his future, and felt that
after this it would seem ungrateful and even grasping on his part to
press for a salary. Still he had to live, and one cannot live on the
magnificence of future prospects alone. He suggested hesitatingly to
Louis that there was this difficulty.

We will come to all that, said Flaubert a little impatiently.
Many men would pay to have the opportunity that is before you, but I
understand from Cartier that your circumstances--?

Jean blushed hotly. Somehow he hated to talk to this man about his
circumstances.

I am very poor indeed, he said coldly. Louis looked slightly
incredulous, but rubbed his hands together more than ever.

Well! well! we shall remedy all that! he said. Your hours will be
from nine to six oclock, Monsieur, at my house, you know; a truly
unpretentious place close by, Number 34; and the evenings you have
entirely to yourself--you can therefore earn as much as you like during
your free time. We do not seek to bind you in any way. Of course, you
quite understand that nothing must ever be said about the system? Of
that we must be as careful as if it was a secret of the confessional.
From now you are one of us. You agree to this, I hope?

Oh yes, certainly, said Jean.

Then, said Louis Flaubert, rising, I think that is all. Ah yes! I
forgot the point, like Madame. Of course, there is your salary. Shall
we begin with four hundred francs a month? I take it that is agreeable
to you, is it not?
