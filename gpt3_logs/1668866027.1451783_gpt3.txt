SCENE:
I accept, Billy Potter laughed.

The children had to take him the rounds too. He wondered at and
exclaimed over the vegetable garden. He exclaimed over and wondered at
the flower garden. He went in swimming in the Magic Mirror, and showed
them many new water tricks. He inspected House Rock with the Little
Six. He climbed to the Tree Room with the Big Six. He declared that the
Tree Room was where he must sleep. And he did sleep there, although it
took all the ingenuity that he possessed, plus the assistance of the
three boys, to pull a cot up into it.

And while Billy Potter was still a guest, as though, as Maida said,
_wonders would never cease_, Dr. Pierce suddenly appeared on the scene.

Dr. Pierce was the Westabrook family physician. He had known Maida all
her life and called her Pinkwink. He too had often visited the Little
Shop; had been one of its advisors.

The children deserted Billy for a moment and threw themselves pell-mell
on the old physician. He stood braced for the shock which made every
one of the tight gray curls on his head quiver and brought the
twinkliest of twinkles to his happy old eyes.

Well, _Pinkwink_! he exclaimed, is this the little girl who used to
have cheeks as white as paper and eyes like a burnt hole in a blanket?
And are these those pale, washed-out, colorless, slim-jim-looking city
children I used to know?

He hugged all the girls impartially, shook hands with the boys; then he
too made the rounds of the place.

He played all his old games on them; drawing Betsy out to tell her
exploits; listening with great enjoyment to Molly and Timmie; and never
ceasing to pretend that Dorothy and Mabel were one girl with a magic
power of being in two places at once.

You must come oftener, Dr. Pierce, Maida said when at last they found
themselves seated in the living room.

Oh Im coming often enough, Dr. Pierce said. Youll get good and
tired of me before I have finished with you. Im coming at regular
intervals to see that you dont drown yourselves or get ivy-poison, or
sun-stroke or lockjaw or any of those things that children are so fond
of. I shall make regular inspections. In fact I am going to make one
this visit. Now that I speak of it, this strikes me as a good time.
Line up over there against the wall, all of you, and stick out your
tongues.

Life fell into regular habits after a while. For work--two hours every
morning, except on Thursdays, took care of that. On Thursdays, however,
it was a matter of several hours. For play--it seemed as though the
rest of the long golden days was all play.

After the household tasks came bathing which had become a habit as
regular as eating. Bathing was almost the best fun they had--especially
for Dicky.

Dicky soon rejected the water wings. He was swimming now--not of course
as fast or as well as the others--but swimming with that fresh joy
which only the amateur knows. The others were perfecting strokes of
various kinds and practising fancy diving of various sorts. Arthur was
of course the best and strongest performer among them. Maida would
never be more than a fair swimmer nor Harold; but Rosie had soon
out-distanced Laura, was beginning to work into Arthurs class. However
Laura was still, would probably always be, the most graceful of them
all.

The afternoons were spent in walking and playing tennis; the evenings
were given up to reading and games.

It looked at first as if their program would never vary. The beautiful
weather kept up and the beautiful country seemed full of diversion.
Occasionally came a dark day and then the boys devoted themselves to
boxing in the barn; their shouts and laughter would reach even to the
Little House. On those occasions Mrs. Dore and Granny would gather the
girls about them; set the older ones to mending or to teaching Molly
and the Clark twins how to sew.

The Big Six kept running into the Burles although the appearance of any
of the Little House children on the path leading to the gypsy camp was
a signal for Silva and Tyma to disappear instantly into the bushes.
The children frequently came across the young gypsies peddling their
baskets in the village--at the pleasant Wampum Arms which was the
Satuit hotel; or at the quiet farmhouses along the road. In the long
walks that they occasionally took in the woods, Maida and her friends
were likely to happen upon the outlaw pair. If the Burles saw the girls
coming, they quickly looked and walked the other way. The two gypsies
were not however much bothered with attentions from the Little House
children, for since the experience at the Magic Mirror, the latter
never voluntarily glanced in their direction.
