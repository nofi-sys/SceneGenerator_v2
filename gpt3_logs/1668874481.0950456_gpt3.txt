SCENE:
XXVIII


DISTINGUISHED VISITORS

GOVERNOR McDOWELL was a cattleman himself. His sympathies were much
engaged in behalf of the Bald Knob raiders. All the evidence at the
trial tended to show that Tait had forced the trouble and had refused
all compromise. From his talk with the prisoners the governor had
learned that the tragedy had flared out unexpectedly. Personally he
liked Rowan McCoy very much. But he could not get away from the fact
that murder had been done. As a private citizen, McDowell would have
worked hard to get his friend a parole; as governor of the State of
Wyoming he could not move in the matter without a legitimate excuse.

It was his hope of finding such an excuse that led him to diverge from
the direct road to Yellowstone for a stop at the Circle Diamond Ranch.
On the way he called at the ranches of several old-timers whom he had
long known.

Its like this, Phil, one of them told the governor. The Government
has stepped in and settled this whole sheep and cattle war. We dont aim
to go night raiding any morenone of us. Sheep are here, and theyre
going to stay whether we like it or not. So we got to make the best of
itand we do. Whats the use of keeping Mac and Brad and the other boys
locked up for an example when we dont need one any more? Everybody
would be satisfied to see em paroled; even the sheepmen would. You
couldnt do a more popular thing than to free the whole passell of em.

The governor made no promises, but he kept his ears open to learn the
drift of public opinion. Even before he reached Circle Diamond he knew
that there would be no strong protest against a parole from the western
part of the State.

Ruth did not make the mistake of letting the governor see her in the
rough-and-ready ranch costume to which she was accustomed. She dressed
her hair with care and wore a simple gown that set off the slender
fullness of her figure. When she came lightly and swiftly to meet them
as the car drew up at the Circle Diamond, her guests were impressed anew
with the note of fineness, of personal distinction. There was, too,
something gallant and spirited in the poise of the small head set so
fastidiously upon the rounded throat.

Mrs. McDowell always admired tremendously her school companion. She was
more proud of her than ever now, and as she dressed for dinner she
attacked her husband.

Youve got to do something for her, Phil. Thats all theres to it. I
cant look that brave girl in the face if you dont let her husband out
of prison.

He was wrestling with a collar and a reluctant button. Hmp! he
grunted.

And that babydid you ever see such a darling? Its a crime to keep
his father away from him.

Its a crime to keep a lot of men in prison, but we do it.

Im not worrying about the rest of them. But Ruths husbandyouve
just got to let him out. She came in and perched herself down on a
couch beside him and cuddled him in a cajoling fashion she had.

You cant bribe me, young lady, he blustered. Dont you see that I
cant let McCoy out unless I parole his accomplices, too? This isnt a
matter to be decided by personal friendship. Ive got to do whats
rightwhat seems right to the average sense of the community.

Do you think its right to keep Ruths husband shut up from her and the
baby? she demanded indignantly.

I dont know. I wish I did.

You told me yourself that hes a fine man, Louise reminded him
triumphantly.

I talk too much, he groaned humorously. But say he is. The
penitentiaries are full of fine men. I cant free them all. He and his
friends killed two men. Thats the point. I cant turn them all loose in
a year. Folks would say it was because Im a cattleman and that Rowan
and Brad Rogers are my friends. Whats more, they would have a right to
say it.

Ruth and Tim Flanders showed the guests over the ranch, and afterward in
the absence of the mistress, who was in the kitchen consulting with Mrs.
Stovall about the dinner, the owner of the Dude Ranch sang her praises
with enthusiasm:

I never saw her beat, Phil. That slim little girl you could break in
two over your knee has got more git-up-and-dust than any man I know. Mac
wanted her to sell the ranch and live off the proceeds. Did she do it?
Not so you could notice it. She grabbed hold with both hands, cleared
off the debts of the trial, wiped off the mortgage, got a permit to run
a big bunch of cattle on the reserve, and has made money hand over fist.
Now shes in lettuce an Im blamed if I dont think shes liable to
make some money out of it. Two or three others are aimin to put some
out next year.
