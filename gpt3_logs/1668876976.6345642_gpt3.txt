SCENE:
Thats all right, too, but its going to make a lot bigger hit if you
get the decision, responded Jimmy. No, youd better make up your mind
to lick him, Dud.

Make up my mind! replied the other impatiently as they traveled
together down the corridor. Hows making up my mind going to help? He
can lick me, and you know it. And I know it. Whats the good of talking
rot like that?

How do you know he can? asked Jimmy eagerly. Ill bet you anything
Stars got a yellow streak in him somewhere. And youve been learning
right along, havent you? Why, say, I call you a mighty clever boxer
right this minute, Dud! Yes, I do, honest! AndI say, what time is it?
Fine! Weve just got time to put on the gloves for a few minutes. I was
reading in that book

Im not going to put on the gloves, answered Dud decidedly. Ill
fight him just as I am. All that scientific stuff isnt much good,
anyway. It didnt keep him from almost knocking me flat on the floor
this afternoon, did it?

But you werent looking for it! If youd known

Besides, the thing is to get him to fight. He says he wont. How can I
make him, Jimmy?

We-ell Jimmy studied the question with his head on one side and
his mouth pursed. At last: There are two or three ways, I guess. You
might challenge him publicly or you might just walk up and slap his
face the way he slapped yours or you might

Thats good enough, interrupted Dud. Come on!

Hold on! Where are you going?

To find him!

Well, butbut wait! Hold on! See here, Dud, you cant walk into a
fellows room and biff him, you know!

Why cant I?

Because it isnt done, old chap. Violation oferhospitality and all
that, you know. What you want to do is to find him some time when other
fellows are around, see? Then he cant possibly refuse. But you want to
make sure that a faculty isnt looking! Better wait now until morning
and get him in School Hall; in the corridor, say. Yes, thats the idea.
Therell be a crowd around, and

Id rather do it now, said Dud. Maybeby tomorrowI might
notmight not want to so much!

Oh, thats all right. Ill keep you up to it, son. Trust me. You
see, Dud, this is a wonderful opportunity and we want to make the
most of it. You wait until the morning and then find Star in the
corridor between recitations. Theres bound to be a crowd there.
Imagine the sensation when you step up to him and let him have
it right on the cheek! Maybe youd ought to say something, too,
somethingereffective. Lets see now. Suppose

Look here, Jimmy, this isnt any silly pageant! I dont care whether
anyones around or not. All you think about is making a public show of
it! You make me tired!

Nothing of the sort, returned Jimmy indignantly. All I say is that
if youre going to do it you ought to do it right! Whats the good of
balling it all up when, by using a littleera little headwork, you
can make a great big hit? No, sir, you listen to me. Im managing you
in this affair, Dud. Just you sit still and leave the whole business to
me.

Leave it to you began Dud bitterly.

Besides, Ive got a better scheme, old chap! Lets do it shipshape,
eh? After supper Ill call on Star and take your challenge to him.
Then, if he says he wont fight, well go ahead with the public
insult scheme. But that will be giving him a chance to accept like a
gentleman. And, of course, whether he accepts or doesnt, the thing is
just bound to leak out. Jimmy grinned. Those things always do.

I wish, said Dud moodily, Id kept my mouth shut and not told you
anything about it. Youre bound to go and hire a brass band and make a
hullabaloo! I dare saysarcasticallyyoull be selling tickets for
the fight!

By Jove, that isnt a bad idea! I dont mean to sell tickets, but we
might issue invitations oror something. You are cordially invited to
be present at an informal scrap between Dudley Baker and Starling Meyer
at five-thirty on Friday. R. S. V. P.
