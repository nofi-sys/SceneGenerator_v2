SCENE:
Fay stopped the cab at the corner of Hyde Park where Oxford Street is
joined by Park Lane. He sprang out, tossed the leaning driver two bright
shillings and started south toward the looming shadows of many mansions.

Reaching Hyde Park Corner he struck westward in a long swinging glide.
The hour was after two. The night was a black pocket, blurred here and
there with blue jewels from the arcs.

He had planned to take a nights rest at the hotel which flanked
Clansons Antique Shop. The dealers statement concerning Dutch Gus,
and, moreover, Saidee Isaacs, changed this plan. He wanted to walk in
the wide places. No trace of drowsiness weighed his eye-lids. Shepherd
Bushthe ThamesRichmond and Hammersmith, were ahead of him. There was
no law in England that prevented a man taking the road. Fay went on,
with his oakum-stained nails gripping his palms, his eyes set ahead and
slightly upward where the yellow vault of the London sky pressed down on
his throbbing temples.

He came, but not by design, to hedge-ensconced villas and the many
winding lanes of Richmond Hill!

Number 4, Rose Crescent, flashed through his brain. This was the
address given to him by Sir Richard Colstrom.

He glanced under the long shelf of boughs which stretched toward the
south and the river. The sight was a pleasing one, despite the nights
dew. Smart driveways, box-hedges, clumps of well trimmed trees and the
ghostly outlines of Queen Anne cottages and villas showed that he was in
one of the better parts of London.

He glided along the grass, momentarily expecting to be accosted by a
constable. The hour was almost three. The chimes of Big Ben were
somewhat distant. The roar of the city was far away. The smug dwellers
of Richmond Hill were wrapped in slumber.

Rose Crescent proved to be a circular drive, bordered by plane trees
whose trunks were encased in iron-grilled railings. Neat curb-steps bore
the names of the owners. A lodge-house was passed with the gates closed
and barred.

The numbers on the curb-stones or on top of the steps started running
down as Fay hurried toward a cross road and the barrier of a high hedge
which enclosed some vast estate.

He stopped as he reached Number 6. The next villa would be the address
mentioned by Sir Richard. Fay stepped to the curb and glanced up and
down from under the shelter of an overhanging bough. No one was in
sight!

Turning swiftly, he darted through the shrubbery of Number 6 and tiptoed
along the driveway. The gravel crunched slightly as he worked toward the
back of a stately villa. He stepped to the grass, listened a moment,
then dropped to his hands and knees and crawled through an opening in a
hedge. He rose, strained his eyes, and stared up at the wall before him.

A mansard roof, gables on the corners, well-curtained bays and wide
porches, denoted one of the smartest of London houses. A small garage at
the end of the driveway had room for two motor cars. A side house, well
hidden in shrubbery, probably contained the servants. The all, in the
nights gloom, was a picture to charm most any prowler.

Fay studied the lower windows, with a professional glance. He drew
himself back into the hedge as he heard a click and then the sound of
somebody moving at the front of the villa.

Steeled and alert, he waited with every nerve tingling. The first sound
was followed by the slight grating of feet upon a porch. A blurred and
well muffled head was thrust around the edge of a white post. Sharp eyes
searched the shrubbery and the hedge. Fay remained motionless. He held
his breath.

Then and shrillingly, there came a signal from the other side of the
villa. The head on the porch was jerked back. A burly form leaped to the
grass where the driveway turned about the house. This form rebounded,
stood erect, then came lumbering toward Fay and the back of the villa.

The shrill cry of warning was repeated. Fay drew himself into the
smallest possible shadow. A man lunged past him. This mans face was
revealed for a moment like a flash seen on a picture screen. It was
unmistakable. It was memory haunting.

Dutch Gus, breathed Fay, hardly daring to move. Thats Dutch Gus. He
heard the crash of glass as the prowler stepped through a low
greenhouse. A fence broke under a mans weight in the back of the
garage. Afterwards came profound silence, until a far-off dog barked and
signaled the mans passing.

Fay waited. It was barely possible that things would quiet down. He had
heard no sound from the villa.
