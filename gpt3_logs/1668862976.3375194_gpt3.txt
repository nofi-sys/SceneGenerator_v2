SCENE:
Youd oughta know bettern that, Budd, an you a candidate for
sheriff, the officer reproved. Say he is a deputy. He cant go
cavortin round all over Nevada, California, and Utah arrestin any one
hes a mind to. Wheres his warrant? Whynt he come to me with it like a
reasonable man wouldthat is, if hes got one.

With his left hand Hugh felt in his pocket and produced a warrant. He
handed it to the sheriff. That gentleman ran his eye over it. He
returned it.

Good only in Ormsby County, he snapped. What arrestin is done here I
doleastways, at present, he added with a sarcastic grin at Budd.

The fat man was caught. He knew nothing about the technicalities of
arrests. What the sheriff said might or might not be true. He tried a
bluff.

This heres an extra-territorial warrant that runs ex judicio, he
explained largely.

That so? asked the sheriff ironically. Well, it sure dont hold water
here. Bad men cant get on the prod with me. No, siree!

The cage had descended to bring up a second load of miners. Meanwhile,
the interest of the crowd centred on the dispute that had arisen. Those
on the outskirts pressed forward, eager to hear what was being said.
Sloan had fallen back and was whispering in the ears of a few choice
spirits.

Hugh spoke out straight and strong. His words were not for the sheriff,
but for the judgment of the unbiased public.

I came here as an officer with a warrant to get this man. Three days
ago he shot down from behind the best man in Nevada, Scot McClintock.
Most of you know my brother, a first-class citizen and soldier. He ran
this scalawag out of Virginia, and he made the mistake of not killin
him right then. Ive made that same mistake myself three times. Yet yore
sheriff says Im a bad man because I come here to arrest a fifteen-times
murderer. How about that, boys?

The crowd was with Hugh at once. The Dodsons controlled the camp. A good
many of these men were dependent upon them financially. But even Ralph
Dodson was hardly popular. As for Dutch, their camp bully, everybody
feared him and nobody trusted him. He was so confirmed a gunman that at
any moment while in drink he might slay any of them.

The sheriff had not volunteered to go down into the mine with one of the
rescue parties; nor had Sloan or any of his cronies. But this young
fellow with the fire-blackened face and hands, whose haggard eyes looked
out with such quiet grim resolution, had gone into that hell below to
save their friends. Byers, the man on his left, had been another of the
rescuers. The fat man had volunteered three times and been rejected.

His warrant goes in Piodie, someone shouted.

Sure does, echoed another voice.

Not on yore tintype, retorted the sheriff. Ormsby County dont run
our affairs. Not none.

The Maine lumberjack lined up beside Hugh, an axe shaft in his hand. He
had observed that Dodson and Sloan were gathering the camp toughs for a
rescue.

His warrants good with megood as the wheat, the big woodsman said.
He made it good, boys, when he stood up to that hose nozzle down below
and stuck there while he baked. He made it good again when he went in to
the crosscut where our friends were trapped.

Sloan and his crowd moved forward. One of them spoke to the sheriff. If
you want to swear in some deputies to enforce the law, Dick, why, were
right here handy.

From out of the crowd a girl darted, light as a deer. She stood directly
in front of Hugh, face to face with the gunmen of the camp. A warm
colour breathed in her cheeks. Her dark eyes flashed with indignation.

Dont you touch him. Dont you dare touch him, she cried. It was my
brother thisthis villain killed. He did shoot him from behind. Ive
had a letter. It was murder.

A murmur of resentment passed like a wave through the crowd. They knew
the slim young school teacher told the truth.

Dont I know? she went on ardently, beautiful in her young
unconsciousness of self as a flaming flower. Wasnt I there when he
tried to kill Hugh hereand Hugh frozen from the blizzard so that he
couldnt lift a hand to help himself? Oh, heshes a terrible man.

He is that, an Irishwomans voice lifted. But glory be, theres wan
man not afraid to comb his whiskers for him. An its a brave colleen
yare to spake up for your fine young man like that.
