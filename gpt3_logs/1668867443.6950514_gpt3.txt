SCENE:
VI TREASURE ISLAND


All through that hot day they continued to push ahead. The captain knew
where the Key lay that was to be his destination, and being a good
mariner, he was laying his course directly thither. By taking the usual
observation at noon he found his bearings, and could alter his course
more or less in consequence. Then there were small islands they passed
from time to time, some of which bore characteristics that he could
recognize, either from having seen them before, or because they were
thus described on his chart as landmarks.

The skipper tells me he has sailed all through the Caribbean many
a time in years that are past, Oscar informed his two chums that
afternoon, as they sat there on the hurricane deck and took things
easy.

I guess it would be hard to mention a particular spot on the globe
where the old man hasnt cruised in his time, Jack observed. And how
strange it is that of late we should run across two such roamers as our
skipper here and Ballyhoos Uncle Abner Crawley.

Call it three while youre about it, please, fellows, interrupted
Ballyhoo, for while weve really not actually had the pleasure of
meeting the gentleman face to face so far, we feel that we know him
just the same, because he keeps haunting our track. I refer to that
born trouble-maker and adventurer, Captain Josephus Badger.

Oh! there are rafts of just such men in the world! Oscar declared,
if only you happen across them, fellows who are rolling stones of
fortune, seeking spots for their operations where men are at war
with their fellows, living by their wits at times, and at others
making fortunes by running cargoes of contraband goods or arms past
a blockade. Right now across in Europe thousands are doing just that
same thing, trying to get food and things into Germany through neutral
countries, and the open sea.

Hello! exclaimed Ballyhoo just then, listen, will you, boys?

The engines have stopped running! observed Jack, partly rising to his
feet as though to look around and see whether this could be accounted
for by anything in sight, and immediately adding: but theres only an
island some distance beyond, and not a sign of any vessel.

Perhaps the engines have broken down? suggested Ballyhoo.

A poor guess, I predict, said Oscar. Theyve been tested under all
sorts of strain, and it isnt likely theyd go back on us as easy as
that. If you asked me now, boys, Id say that yonder Key is the one
were aiming to reach, and that our skipper isnt in any great hurry to
draw in there before nightfall.

Just what is in the wind, lad, observed Captain Shooks, who had
thrust his head above the combing of the little deck hatch while the
boys were exchanging these views. Well drop down until were almost
awash, and in that way manage to avoid attracting attention in the
gathering darkness, as we approach yon island. Yes, it is Coco Key,
marked on our chart as the place for trying out our glorious plans.

Of course this was pleasing news for the three chums. Things were going
to take on a substantial change with them. Prowling around there on
or near the bottom of the sea, endeavoring to locate the hulk of the
treasure ship that was said to have been sunk there many, many years
before, they would be also given an opportunity for observing those
amazing sights which Jack meant to catch with his magical camera.

So they continued to gaze at the still far distant Key through the
glasses. Of course they could not have seen any human being, but
Ballyhoo, who really possessed remarkable vision, stoutly declared he
could trace a thin column of smoke rising above the tree-crowned isle.

The others being unable to locate this sign of Coco Key being
inhabited told Ballyhoo that it must be a vein of clouds he saw; but,
nevertheless, he stubbornly persisted in sticking to his assertion.

You wait and see whos right, thats all, fellows, he told them, for
Ballyhoo, as we have seen on other occasions, was a very stubborn chap,
and ready to nail his flag to the mast before giving up the ship.

So they continued to move on at half speed. So low in the water did the
submarine lie that no one without the aid of a good glass could, from
the Key, have detected its presence amidst the choppy little waves. And
presently, after the sun had sunk amidst the gathering clouds, there
was no danger of their coming being known.

After they had eaten their supper the boys once more mounted to the
upper deck. It was only natural that they should feel an intense
interest in this lonely little Key that lay directly in the path of the
hurricanes bred amidst the terrible Windward Islands.
