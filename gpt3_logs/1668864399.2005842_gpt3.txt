Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
It was a soft and gracious evening early in the month. The dusk,
drenched by dew, which brought out the fragrance of locust blossoms, of
peonies, roses, and cut grass in the dooryards up and down the street,
fell over Harts Run in breath after breath of oncoming darkness,
obliterating the sordid aspect of the village--except where the
electric lights glaringly defied it--so that the cheap lines of the new
garage were gathered into obscurity, the telegraph poles disappeared,
and looking up one saw the wide, tumbled outline of mountains, with a
remote young moon sailing the sky.

Some of the nights fragrance drifted in through Julies back door, but
she was unconscious of its appeal, having gone into her shop to see if
everything was in order and safely locked up, before she started out
for the week-night prayer-meeting.

She had already seen to everything once, but she returned nervously
this second time just to be quite sure that all was safe. Snapping on
the light, she stood a moment, and looked all about the neat little
place; then she stepped across and tried the handle of the door. She
was just turning away, when a sudden rasping noise jumped her heart
into her throat, and stiffened all the nerves at the back of her neck.
She stood transfixed, frozen with terror. She was all alone in her part
of the house. What could the noise be? A snake? Once, as a little girl,
she had almost stepped on a rattlesnake, and ever since any sudden
rasping sound threw her into an agony of fear. Again the sound broke
forth, constricting her with renewed terror. But now she realized that
it came from the old disused fireplace, and she knew distressfully well
what it was; though her fear left her, revulsion and discomfort took
its place. It was the chimney swallows. Their nest had come down and
the young birds were in the fireplace. Julie crept over, and pulling
forward the board screen which she had covered with wall paper, peered
into the hearth. There was only one, a naked little fledgling with
blind eyes and gaping mouth. The sight of it nauseated Julie, and yet
filled her with unhappy compassion.

Poor little thing! Poor little thing! she shuddered. What in the
world am I going to do with you?

Julie! Aw, Julie! a strident voice called all at once from the back
door, making Julie jump again.

It was Mrs. Dolly Anderson, Julie knew. She had stopped on her way to
prayer-meeting. Julie wished she had not come until she had decided
what to do about the chimney-swallow.

Julie! Where are you? the rasping voice persisted. Mrs. Anderson was
coming in through the back way, and was already in the kitchen. Julie
hastily replaced the screen, and met her at the shop door.

There you are, dearie, the visitor proclaimed. I been bawling my
head off for you. I come by to go with you to prayer meetin--but you
looks white as a sheet. Whats the matter?

Nothing, Im all right, Julie said, nervously.

Somethings scared you, the other stated, her stalwart figure
settling firmly back upon her heels, as she surveyed Julie with a
relentless stare. I never knowed any person to get scared as easy as
you do, Julie. Whats happened now? Ill bet a hopper-grass jumped
at you! Or, with sudden elephantine playfulness, I caught you up to
something you hadnt ought to do. Now then! she admonished, shaking
a stubby and roguish finger, and pouncing inexorably upon Julies
self-conscious look. Tell its mammy what its been doin.--Oh, for the
_mercy sake_! Whats _that_?

The young swallow had broken out stridently once more.

Its a chimney-swallow, Julie confessed. I was just trying to think
what to do with it.

Where is it--over in the fireplace? Mrs. Anderson, with a tread that
made the boards complain under her, went over and pulled the screen
away, with large competent hands. Ugh! How I despise little naked
birds! she ejaculated. Here, wheres the cat?

Oh, I dont want the cat to get it.

Yes, you do. There aint a thing else to do. Here, kitty! Puss, puss,
puss!

But I tell you I dont want--

Yes you do, too, Julie. Here, kitty, kitty! You _got_ to do it, Julie!
There aint another thing to do with em. Pus-sie! Puss, puss!

Julies big black cat came running in on soft eager feet.

Here, pussie! Mrs. Anderson called.

No, dont! Please dont! Julie begged. Scat! scat out of here,
Blackie!


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

It is evening, and Julie is getting ready to go to a prayer meeting. She is in her shop, making sure everything is in order and locked up, when she hears a noise coming from the old, disused fireplace. She knows immediately that it is a chimney swallow, and her first reaction is one of terror. However, she quickly realizes that the bird is just a fledgling and feels compassion for it. She is trying to decide what to do with it when Mrs. Dolly Anderson, a neighbor, comes in and startles her. Mrs. Anderson is on her way to the prayer meeting as well, and is eager to know what has scared Julie. When Julie tells her about the chimney swallow, Mrs. Anderson is quick to say that the only thing to do is to let the cat catch it. Julie is horrified at the idea, but Mrs. Anderson is insistent. She calls the cat, and it comes running in. Julie begs her not to let it catch the bird, but Mrs. Anderson does not listen. The cat catches the bird and kills it.
