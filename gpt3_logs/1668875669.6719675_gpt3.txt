SCENE:
But Topham stood motionless, hand on the back of the chair, looking at
her.

The sun streamed golden through the great window, a stray beam lighting
on her hair, transformed its dark mass into iridescent fire. A potted
palm swept her shoulders with its delicate fronds. From the street
below came up the tramp of men, the rattle of wagons, the jingle of a
tram car.

Abruptly Topham spoke. Please send the baroness away! he directed,
serenely.

Again the countess face flamed. She rose half way from her chair; then
sat down again, trembling.

Senor! she faltered, returning instinctively to her mother tongue.
What mean you? I--I can not receive you without a duenna. It--it is
impossible.

Not to you! To others, perhaps! Send her away--please.

But it is impos-- She rose. Baroness, she said, would you mind
looking for a letter from Herrman that I left in the bottom of my
escritoire?

The baroness rose. Her expression was inscrutable. Perhaps she was
already so much surprised that her features, incapable of expressing
her amazement, had reverted to their former placidity--a placidity from
which nothing was likely soon to stir them. Yes! Yes! she murmured.
Yes! Yes! Mein Gott!

When she had disappeared through the door at the end of the room the
countess turned to Topham. Now, senor, she said, with more spirit
than she had shown since the Americans arrival. I have obeyed your
orders and sent away my duenna. True, she is only in the next room,
but still we are alone. What have you to say to me to warrant such a
demand?

You know. Tophams voice was not quite so steady. Senorita, he went
on. Let me tell you something of myself. I belong to an old Virginia
family--one of the F. F. Vs., as they call us derisively. My people
have lived in Virginia for nearly three hundred years, and nearly every
one of them had a romance. My great grandparents eloped; my grandfather
married my grandmother the day after he met her; my father wanted to
marry my mother at first sight of her, but was compelled to wait a
year--till he was nineteen. I understand that your heritage is similar;
that your father stole your mother from the dukes palace. Finally--He
paused and leaned forward.

When I parted from you this morning I thought I could wait. I meant
to see you again, but I thought--. But I was wrong. I can not leave
you without speaking! When I saw you on the street I knew that I could
not. Love has come to me suddenly, as it comes to all the men of my
race--suddenly but for all time. I have played at love-making before.
I did not know what love was. I thought--Good God! How could I have
thought as I did? How could any man mistake water for wine, moonshine
for sunshine?

Very slowly and deliberately, he took the countess face between his
palms and looked down at her. Look at me, Elsa, he said.

Slowly she lifted her starry eyes to his. He bent forward and their
lips met. That makes you mine, he said slowly.

The countess said not a word, but she slipped slowly into his arms
and nestled against his broad bosom. It was preposterous, ridiculous,
incredible--this love-making; it was so very American, but--but--what
the countess really thought about it would be hard to tell. Whether she
was as mad as Topham or whether there was a purpose in her madness did
not appear.

Topham tilted her perfect chin upward. Doesnt it? he asked, with a
shade of anxiety in his voice. You love me? You will marry me--soon?

Gently the countess freed herself; then she stood up and faced him.
Yes! she said. I love you, and I will marry you or no other man,
She stepped closer to him, and reaching up, placed both hands upon his
shoulders and kissed him on the mouth. Yes! she repeated. I will
marry you--but not soon.

Why not? I am under orders. I must leave Berlin tonight. Will you come
with me--or shall I resign from the Navy and stay with you?

Neither! I can not marry you--now. No! That is not true! I can, but I
will not. I dare not.

Dare not! Who prevents--

Honor!
