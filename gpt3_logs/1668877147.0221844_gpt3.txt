SCENE:
XXI

ON THE MOUND


Dud wonderedJimmy wasnt there to stop him!what Mr. Sargent would
say to him on Monday regarding that performance of his in the Lawrence
Textile game. As a matter of fact, Mr. Sargent said absolutely nothing,
either then or at any other time. There was very light practice that
afternoon, most of it batting, and the fellows were dismissed early,
many of them returning after changing to the practice diamond to watch
the second team put away the Grafton High School nine. It wasnt
a vastly exciting affair, however, for the second, with Joe Kelly
pitching, had things about its own way. Dud and Jimmy departed at the
end of the seventh inning, leaving the home team five runs to the good,
and spent a half-hour on the river in Nick Blakes canoe. (Jimmy asked
permission when they returned, and so that was all right!) Jimmy was
troubled today and made Dud his confidant as they paddled slowly along
under the drooping boughs. His trouble concerned Starling Meyer. But
well let Jimmy tell it in his own inimitable way.

Someone, said Jimmy morosely, has told Star he could play baseball.
Huh! Thats all right, too, but whats the use of making me let go
the second and then dumping me in just when the fun begins? How do I
know Ill be dumped? Well, I dont, I suppose. But, listen, if that
chap keeps on butting in wherell I be? Ordway and Boynton and Parker
are sure of the outfield places unless they break a leg or a neck or
something. Well, sure, thats O. K.; theyre better than I am. I know
that. The only chance I get is when one of em is out of the game.
One of ems likely to be out now and then and so I get a whack. All
right, say we. But here comes thisthis Indian, Meyer, butting in and
snooping around for the crumbs, too. That makes two of us; three, if
you count Ben Myatt; and Petes likely to put Ben in center or right
any chance he gets because Ben can bat like a whale! If Star Meyerd
mind his own business, which is playing hockey and running creation,
Id have a fair chance to get into one of the Mount Morris games,
wouldnt I? Sure, I would! Parker isnt very spry on that game leg of
his, and Ive noticed that Boynton is looking sort of like a friend of
mine looked before he went into a decline. And Hobo might fall out of
his canoe any day and get drownedif hed only use it more. I must
suggest it to him. He doesnt get enough exercise. Why the dickens
cant Star keep out of it? Thats what I want to know. Something told
me away last winter that Id have trouble with that galoot before the
year was over!

I thought I was the one, said Dud slyly.

Jimmy grunted. So did I. Well, anyway, one good thing is that faculty
hasnt forbidden _me_ to take a fall out of him!

But you cant very well thrash a fellow for just playing ball, Jimmy!

I can beat him up for interfering with my affairs, responded the
other with dignity. Bet you anything you like he will work around Guy
Murtha and Guyll take him along to Corliss day after tomorrow.

I suppose Parker will be back by then, suggested Dud.

Parker? Oh, I dare say. But, listen, Dud, between you and me now,
I dont believe Parker stands awfully high with Pete. I wouldnt be
surprised if he didnt get back again; regularly, I mean. And if he
doesnt, why, maybe little Jimmy T. Logan will have a chance, eh? That
is, if Meyer doesnt persuade Guy that hes a ball-player beforehand.

Youre hitting better than Star, arent you?

Nno, I dont think so. Wish I were! Still, I get my base a heap
oftener. I suppose shooting at hockey helps Star hit the ball. Say, do
you know, Dud darling, Im going to be sort of peeved and disappointed
if I dont get into one of those Mount Morris games? I wasnt awfully
keen at first, as you know, but now that Ive started Id like to make
good. Besides, he added gloomily, the familyll be here for that
second game and Id feel like an awful chump if I had to swing my legs
on the bench all the afternoon!

Youd be in good company, said Dud.

Meaning you? asked the other, as he turned the canoe back toward
home. Oh, youll get your chance, Dud. Mount Morris has got some
hitters, they say, and if she has neither Myatt nor Nate Leddy will
last the games through. As for Brunswick, I guess hes a goner for this
year.

Theres Weston, though.

Thats so, too. I wouldnt be a bit surprised to see Gus turn around
and pitch a corking game some day soon. I guess the trouble with Gus
is that hes too temperamental. He and I are alike that way. If the
weather isnt just right or the moons in the wrong quarter or the
tides too high or his shoe pinches him, Gus cant pitch a little bit.
But some day all the signs are going to be just right, and Gus will
slip on a pair of old shoes, and he will go out there and make em eat
out of his hand. Jimmy paused. Then: Maybe, he added cautiously,
you cant tell about Gus. Like me, he has the artistic temperament.
