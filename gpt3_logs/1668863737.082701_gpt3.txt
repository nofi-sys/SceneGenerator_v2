SCENE:
XXVIII


THERE was no meal that Flaubert enjoyed so much as his breakfast.
It seemed to him to be the great opportunity of appearing as a
grand _seigneur_; for, in his opinion, to take your breakfast in a
blue boudoir leading from your bed room, attired in a flowered silk
dressing-gown, sufficiently expressed every claim of ancient blood.

It was here that he received the younger secretary and dictated to him
any part of his correspondence he could induce Jean to accept as the
business of Torialli, and tried to impress that impatient youth with
the belief that the remainder of his letters were the subdued tributes
of every young and beautiful woman in Paris.

To-day Flaubert had reached his second cup of chocolate before Jeans
knock sounded at the door.

He did not at once notice anything unusual in Jeans appearance except
that he carried a new and rather formidable walking-stick.

That memento _dun Apche_, my dear fellow, you might have left in
the hall, Flaubert observed Think of my china!

I will try to bear it in mind, said Jean briefly.

Flaubert took a mouthful of egg without salt and made a face. There was
something discomposing in the voice of Jean DUcelles; it sounded like
that of a man who is standing on the edge of his patience.

In the first place, said Jean, approaching the table, I should be
obliged if you would give me a receipt for this, and he laid in front
of Monsieur Flaubert Margots bill, with the notes for four hundred
francs. I come on the part of Mademoiselle Selba, Jean finished in
the same dry manner.

Business _now_, Jean! cried Flaubert, playfully lifting a reproving
forefinger. You know my habits! You dont want to make a dose of my
morning chocolate. All this affair of the little Selba, see, let us
go into it later! You settle her little bills for her do you, then,
_hein_? Shocking, shocking! And I who thought you so fresh from the
country!

I would like the receipt now, Monsieur, said Jean; his nostrils
twitched, and as he moved nearer Flaubert his hand opened and closed
about the handle of his walking-stick.

Flaubert looked furtively at the bell; it was at some little distance
from the table. He pushed away his unfinished egg and signed the paper.

Thank you, said Jean, putting the receipt in his pocket. And now,
Monsieur Flaubert, it is my regrettable duty to show you why I have not
left my stick in the hall--if you wish to defend yourself I will give
you time to reach the poker--but I am afraid I must stand between you
and the bell. I will do my best to avoid the china.

Flaubert was not usually a quick man, but he acted with the agility of
a cat at this crisis of his career. He had no intention whatever of
trying to defend himself, but he lost no time in disappearing swiftly
under the table.

There was a crash of china, the cloth was swept on to the floor, the
azure carpet was drenched in broken foods, priceless blue Worcester
lay in fragments, and then Jean kicked the table over and clutched
the flowered dressing-gown. Shriek after shriek rose on the air; the
present of Romain did its work with swiftness and skill; only one of
Flauberts vases was broken, and this disaster was simply owing to his
having clung at the wrong moment to one of his companions legs.

Suddenly the cries ceased, the _portire_ at the door was thrown aside,
and Gabrielle stood in the room.

Jean flung down his stick and turned to face her. Flaubert cringed,
white and trembling, against the useless shelter of the table. None of
the three spoke for a moment.

Then Madame closed the door behind her and floated forward into the
middle of the room; her eyes wavered and passed over the broken
crockery, they glanced lightly at Louis prostrate form, and rested on
the open window and the blue, spring sky.

Something extraordinarily different had come into the atmosphere of
Flauberts room; nothing had changed, chocolate still dripped on to the
azure carpet, and yet Jean could have sworn it was all a dream. Nothing
violent had happened, nothing violent could happen in the presence of
Gabrielle Torialli.

She stood there, with the sun on her hair, in a grey Japanese silk
gown; there were faint peach-blossom embroideries here and there, and
the lining looked like a soft pink cloud.
