SCENE:
III

THE JOURNEY


As the train drew into the Satuit Station, it seemed to spill children
from every door. Counting them carefully, Granny Flynn and Mrs. Dore
found to their great relief that the twelve, with whom they started,
were still all with them. But--big and little--they were all so full
of the excitement of the trip that it looked as though, at any moment,
they might vanish in the strange country which surrounded them. Arthur,
leading the two boys, started an investigation of the station. The
three big girls followed. Only the little children, tired by the
trip and awed to quiet by the unfamiliar surroundings, stayed close
to the womens skirts. Timmies big full eyes surveyed in wonder the
strange new world. Delia, who had fallen comfortably asleep in her
mothers arms, suddenly waked up, rubbing her eyes, and looked about
her. Oh take me back to Shalstown! she wailed in a sudden attack of
homesickness and fortunately fell asleep again.

Oh heres the car! Maida called.

A big comfortable limousine came round the bend of the road. The driver
alighted, and came forward. Here I am at last, Miss Maida, he said,
his hand to his cap.

Oh good afternoon, Botkins, Maida greeted him. She introduced him to
Granny Flynn and Mrs. Dore; then to the children.

Im sorry I was late, maam, Botkins said to Granny Flynn, but I
nearly ran over a dog in the road. I stopped to see if it was all
right.

And was it? Rosie Brine, who had a passion for animals, asked eagerly.

Right as a trivet, Botkins answered.

What is a trivet, Maida? Rosie asked in a mystified aside.

Ill show in a few minutes, goose, Maida rejoined. Its an English
word.

Botkins, who was English also, began stowing the party away in the
automobile: Granny Flynn and Mrs. Dore on the back seats; Betsy and
Delia between them; and Mollie and Timmie at their feet. Maida and
Laura each holding a very active Clark twin, occupied the little seats.
Rosie, to her great delight, was permitted to sit with the driver. The
three boys hung onto the running board.

We look like an orphan-asylum, Arthur commented as, with a long call
of warning from the horn, they started off.

The road stretched straight before them, wide and yellow, furred with
trees on both sides; then vanished under an arch of green as it turned
to the left.

Arent there any houses in Satuit, Maida? Laura asked.

Plenty, Maida answered. Well come to some in a minute--then to
more. In a little while, well go right through the town.

For a few moments nobody spoke; just watched for the first house.
Presently a little white farmhouse, gambrel-roofed and old, popped into
view at one side.

Oh did you see that lovely old well with the long pole? Rosie
exclaimed from the front seat.

Thats a well-sweep, Maida explained. It has a bucket at one end.

Oh see the ponies! One, two, three, four, five-- but the car shot
Laura past before she had all the ponies counted.

Gee, look at all those hens! came from Arthur. Must be a hundred!

And then followed a chorus of Oh sees! The beautiful big barn with
its wide doors! The lovely little pond covered with lily pads: The
trim little vine-covered summer house perched on the hill! Bee hives!
The old grave yard!

And, See the moo-cow! piped up Betsy Hale and Tee the moo-tow!
Delia, as usual mimicked her.

Timmie did not speak; but his big eyes, made bigger by wonder, mirrored
everything.

Theres the town! Maida said finally and again for a few moments
there was silence.

The town manifested itself at first only by scattered farmhouses.
But these began to draw closer and closer together until, finally,
they seemed almost to huddle about the beautiful little white church
standing amidst rows of old lichen-covered slate gravestones, and
pointing with a slender, delicately-cut-and-carved, white spire at the
blue sky. Stores were here too, a moving picture house; a small inn; a
post office; a garage.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The scene opens with the train arriving at the Satuit Station, and the twelve children spilling out onto the platform. They are met by Botkins, the driver, who takes them to their limousine. The road stretches out before them, and they pass a farmhouse, a barn, a pond, a graveyard, and finally the town.
