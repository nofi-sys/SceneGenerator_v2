SCENE:
The mans eyes burned: his breath came hot and fast. His tones carried
the intoxication of assured success.

It is a great game and a great stake, he hurried on. A great game.
Its web involves four continents; it stretches from Brazil across both
the Atlantic and the Pacific and far to the northward. And at its
center I sit. Strand by strand I have woven it and tested it. It cannot
break. Why! see here!

He thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out a paper, which he tore
apart with shaking fingers. See! he cried. See what the emperor has
written. With his own hand he has written it! Read! Read!

The girl pushed away his hand. No! No! she cried. I wont read! I
wont listen.

But the man would not be denied. Read! Read! he clamored. Read! See
what the emperor promises. Determinedly he thrust the paper before
her eyes, and held it there while its words burned themselves into the
girls brain, never to be forgotten.

You see! You see! he cried.

Miss Byrd drew back. Her brain was whirling. Half understood facts and
unintelligible rumors had suddenly blended into a comprehensive whole.
Rutiles fancies had become facts--the facts of a great political
conspiracy. It was not merely what Ouro Preto had said; taken alone
that might be set down as the vaporings of a dreamer who took wishes
and fancies for facts. But dreamers do not receive letters such as his
from the Kaiser; and their dreams are not corroborated by a horde of
apparently unrelated facts such as Miss Byrd had in her possession.

The man was still speaking. Only one thing remains in my way now, he
triumphed. Nothing but these cursed Yankees can oppose me. And now I
am going to draw their teeth. Too long have they assumed to control the
destinies of all the Americans. Too long have they stood in my way.
Now--now I am about to eliminate them--to crush them if they dare to
interpose. Thank God you are English--

But I am not English!

The man started back. Not English! he babbled. Not English! Are you
not the niece of Lord Maxwell?

No! I am--I am--Count! I have deceived you. I have let you think me
English. I knew you had a secret and I wanted to wheedle it out of you.
I am ashamed--ashamed. I dont know why! I never was ashamed of my work
before. But I am now. You cannot say anything too bad for me. I deserve
it all. The girl bowed her head and her shoulders shook.

The man caught her wrist, and spun her around to face him. You are a
government spy? he demanded desperately.

The girl shook her head. No! I am a newspaper woman.

The mans bowed shoulders suddenly straightened. Hope sprang up in
him. A newspaper woman! Then--then--Come! That is not so bad. You can
resign and marry me.

But Lillian shook her head. No! No! I cannot, she murmured. I am
sorry, but--I cannot.

Ouro Preto stared at her. Then: Well? Let that go for the moment.
Later--But now--See? I am rich! very rich! I will pay you two--three
years salary and you will forget all that I have said. It is a
bargain? No?

But the girl bowed her head miserably. Oh! she cried. I have fallen
low--low! I said you could say nothing too hard for me to hear, but I
never dreamed that you--you of all men--would offer me money! that you
should think me for sale. I am shamed. I have had to earn my own living
and I have done it. I have gone on from step to step, not realizing.
But, believe me, I never did anything quite so indefensible as this
before. I never tricked a mans love to get his secret before.

The man was listening intently. But his thoughts were clearly of
himself, and not of her. He seemed to have forgotten the words of love
that he had breathed only a few moments before. When he spoke his tones
still trembled, but with an emotion very different from love.

Then you will not forget? he asked.

How can I? whispered the girl, miserably. If I only could! But I
cant! I cant. I can resign and I will. I shall give nothing to the
paper about you. If your secret were almost anything but what it is, I
would repeat it to no one. But--the girls figure straightened--but
you are plotting against my country! and I must warn those who should
know. I must! I must! You see that, dont you, Count?

Pleadingly she leaned forward and gazed up into his face.
