SCENE:
But, Jake you tole me youd drive em into the river, an when I
get here theyre gone! What would you say in a case like that? Dont
it _look_ as if youd done it?

But I tell you I didnt! They was there last night. To-day they was
gone. Thats all I know about em.

Well-- Mr. Manley shook his head, and at that moment Roy bounded
up the steps.

Dad! Were here at last. Had a tough time of it.

Roy! Teddy! Glad to see you, boys. I was beginnin to worry, but I
figured you might have been delayed on account of the storm. And now
youre here-- he spread his hands expressively--we might as well
turn around an go home. The cows are gone. Trummer--

Wait, Dad, Teddy said quickly. Youre wrong. Mr. Trummer had
nothing to do with the cattle being stolen.

Stolen! How do you know that? Who stole em? Jake Trummer--

Give the boy a chance, Bardwell! Mr. Trummer interrupted testily.
He knows more about it than you do. Let him speak.

Its just this, Teddy went on, with a look at the others. Two
nights ago we camped by the stream, because the storm came up, and
we couldnt see our way clear to taking a chance on keeping afloat.
Late at night--at least it seemed late--Roy and I walked down to the
river, leavin Pop an Bug Eye by the fire. That right, Pop?

The veteran nodded.

Yuh tell it, Teddy. Yuh know more about it than what I do.

We headed for the river, the boy went on, and when we got there
we heard some men talking. They were in a boat on the stream. Some
one they called Denver--

Denver! Jake Trummer broke in. Thats--But go ahead, son. Ill
have my say later, he added, with a glance at Mr. Manley.

This Denver had a plan to rustle our cattle that had strayed over
here, an he aimed to let you think Mr. Trummer did as he had
threatened, Teddy went on swiftly. Theyd found out, somehow,
about the whole business; maybe from The Pup, though he didnt
appear to be with them. They were going to drive the cows off at
night, and, by golly, thats what they did!

For a moment there was silence. Mr. Manley looked at Jake Trummer,
his face a deep red. Then he threw back his head and thrust out his
hand.

Jake, he said falteringly, I aint sayin nothin now. Ive done
all my talkin--a sight too much, I reckon. Ill stay dumb for the
rest of my life. But if you can forgive an old fool--

With a grin, Jake Trummer clasped the hand offered him, and gripped
hard.

We all make mistakes, he said softly. I made the first one. All
the forgivin to be done aint on my side. I come to you like a bag
o wind an shot my mouth off when I shouldnt. Some hand of yourn
told one of my men that the orders were to let the cattle stray as
far as they wanted, on my range if possible, because the grazin was
good an they needed fattenin. I was a fool to believe it.

The Pup! Teddy and Roy exclaimed in the same breath.

Was he tall, Mr. Trummer? Teddy asked. Dark?

Never saw him, Mr. Trummer answered, releasing Mr. Manleys hand.
He told one of my men. Well, Bardwell, well forget it. We were
both wrong, I, mebby, more than you. Now lets get this thing
straight. First I want to ask yore boy: Did that man you said they
called Denver have a high-pitched, cracked voice?

Ill tell a maverick he did! Roy replied excitedly. High as a
girls, almost. Why?

That was Denver Smith, Mr. Trummer declared. Theyre the last of
the old gangs, an the sooner they go the better. They make their
headquarters on the banks of Whirlpool River an try to pick up tips
they can use in their business, which is everything from
high-jackin to rustlin. I pity the man that rides that river road
alone an with money in his pocket. Theyd get him sure. Yep, boys,
it was Denver Smith an his bunch fer a sure bet. What did they say,
again?

They were planning to steal our cattle and let you take the blame,
Roy replied. They knew youd had an argument with dad up on our
ranch, though I dont know how.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Two men from different ranches have a fight and then make up. The fight was over some cattle that were stolen. The men find out that it was a man named Denver Smith who stole the cattle and not Jake Trummer.
