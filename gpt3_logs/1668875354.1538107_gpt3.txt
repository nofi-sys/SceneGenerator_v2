What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
I shant be able to, Annie. He is a great deal sharper than you
think, and he would guess who sent it directly.

You must say nothing about it for a few days, as he will know you have
just seen me. But in about a week you can spring it upon him suddenly,
and he will be off his guard by that time and believe you. Now dont
raise any more objections, for you must take it; and I can spare it
quite well. I know you are a man of property, said she, laughing--for
Stephen had a little money of his own--and would be offended if I
offered to lend you money; but, if you ever should want a little
check, you must remember that I, too, am a person of property now--at
least, as long as my engagement lasts; and I have just signed for
another two years at a higher salary.

And, before he went away, she put into his hands a little packet
containing ten pounds, which he took reluctantly, bound by a solemn
promise not to let Harry know whom it came from. She sent a little note
to her husband, too, begging him to write to her, telling him all about
the renewal of her engagement, cheering him by all the encouraging
words she could think of, entreating him not to despond if he were not
immediately successful in the work, whatever it might be, which he had
taken up, and saying all that a wife could think of to a better husband
than Harry. She refrained from sneers or sarcasm, for she had made up
her mind to take her husband as he was, to do her duty as his wife as
well as he would let her; and she tried to throw all her thoughts and
all her hopes into her own career, so that she might escape from the
regrets which would arise in moments of depression at the thought that
no home happiness would ever be possible for her.

That week, during which Harry had devoted himself to proving that
happiness was possible for them together, had left deeper results
than he guessed; he had paid her back in her own coin for tantalizing
him during his convalescence by a kindness which was not meant to
be more than a temporary effort. It was not for some time that the
thought flashed into her mind that this had been a deliberately planned
revenge on his part for her obstinate refusal to stay at the Grange
with him. Such a refinement of vengeance did not seem in keeping with
Harrys character; yet it seemed scarcely more improbable than the wild
inconsistency of loving her devotedly one week and being perfectly
happy without her the next.

She tried to solve the problem by acute questionings of Stephen when
she saw him next; but he was more cautious and reticent than ever,
seemed uneasy under the fire of her inquiries, and she soon saw that
a continuance of them would only result in his having recourse to
falsehood in reply. So she had to content herself with learning that
Harry had taken the money; but she understood from what his cousin said
that he was in want of more, and with ready generosity she sent him all
the rest of her savings.

Are you sure you can spare all this? asked Stephen, uneasily, as he
stood hesitatingly with the money in his hand.

Quite, quite sure. You need not look so downcast about taking it,
said she, laughing. You are to tell Harry I have plenty, and whenever
he wants more you have only to come to me.

Tell Harry?

Oh, doesnt he know it is from me?

No, no; I did not dare to tell him! You told me not to. He would not
have taken it.

You are quite right. I had forgotten. Well, say that George has
some more for him, and will give it to him when he wants it. Or
stay! couldnt you say it comes from Lady Braithwaite? asked Annie,
brightly, more pleased than she knew to find that her husband was still
too proud to accept money from her hands.

He would not believe that. My aunt has only just enough to live upon.

Lilian?

Lilian is abroad. I dont know whether she has heard anything about it
yet.

Well, say what you like, as long as you make him take it.

And you are quite sure the want of it will not inconvenience you?

You are as sensitive for Harry as he is for himself. Look at the
luxury I am surrounded by, and Annie pointed gayly to the bouquets
and fruit on the table. Doesnt all this speak for itself? The money,
you understand, comes from somebody else; but you may take him this
from me; and with nervous, trembling fingers she pulled out from their
companions a spray of jasmine and a crimson azalea, fastened them
together, and put them into his hands as he left the room.

I am afraid that poor fellow is going to die, she thought, as she
listened to his slow footsteps and the thud of his crutch upon the
stairs; I never saw him look so ill as he did to-day. I wonder where
he lives? He cannot be in want--I know he has money enough to keep him,
and Harry even, with the money I send him, would have enough for them
both. Poor fellow!


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Annie and Stephen, and to set up the conflict between them. Annie is trying to help her husband, Harry, by sending him money secretly through Stephen. Stephen is reluctant to take the money, because he knows Harry would be offended if he knew it came from Annie. This sets up the conflict between Annie's desire to help her husband and Stephen's loyalty to Harry.
