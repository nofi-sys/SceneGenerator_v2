Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
At seven bells, the sun being in sight, Fred was roused, to take
meridian observations; and, as he stood in a patch of sunlight, I
noticed that he wabbled unsteadily, and that his eyes were sunken and
glassy. But I thought nothing of this until eight bells, when the
skipper informed me that, on overhauling the burned-out storeroom, he
had found a small keg of whiskey missing. As the men had assisted in
putting out the fire, he thought it advisable to have an overhaul of
the two forecastles, as whiskey in bulk was an unwise stimulant for
sailors at sea. So, while he and Fred were at dinner, I searched the
crew's quarters, but found nothing. In fact, remembering those glassy
eyes, I did not expect to. I so reported to the skipper, and when I had
finished my dinner I made a quick, unofficial, yet thorough, inspection
of Fred's room, and found nothing there. But I made no report of this.
He had hidden it.

From this on, Fred's condition was apparent to anyone who cared to
observe. I so cared, but do not think that the skipper did. He talked
with him, counseled him, and tutored him, glad, evidently, to be in a
position to aid so promising a young man.

Fred received it all with sodden gravity, too drunk to question, yet
sober enough to listen. I would have taken him in hand, bullied and
coerced him into giving up that store of whiskey, had I not been
maddened by jealousy and the sight of the girl's eyes, never resting
upon me, but following Fred about the deck, with the adoring gaze of
devotee. He was an exceptionally handsome youngster; and, to her, I
suppose, was a demigod, who had heroically saved her life, while I was
a person to be tolerated because necessary.

"Well," I said, between my teeth, "let him work out his own
salvation--or damnation."

He worked out the latter. In the lower berth in my room, just across
the passage from Fred's, was a living, wheezing, half-alive dead
man--the disabled second mate, whose place I was filling. At first,
he had glared unspeakable hatred at me, but as I had responded with a
few kindly acts born of pity, this look left his eyes, and gave way to
inquiry and interest. He could not speak, and could barely breathe,
but about this time seemed anxious to say something to me. Every day
he tried, and at last, somewhat distressed at his painful efforts, I
advised him to wait until he could talk, and not bother me like this.
So he stopped his efforts, and, as I had not thought to give him paper
and pencil, his message was deferred until too late. But in every watch
below I saw the _thing_.

We soon picked up the trade wind, and under the influence of mild blue
skies, racing white clouds, and warm weather, the young niece of the
captain recovered her health and spirits. There was color in her cheeks
and light in her eyes that bespoke a happy disposition; but she seldom
noticed me--in fact, she spoke to the man at the wheel much oftener,
and I could only grit my teeth, keep my clothing as neat as possible,
and study navigation in my watch below.

As I progressed, I was surprised to find how easy it was, and soon I
felt competent, if need arose, to take chronometer sights, lay out a
traverse, and keep the log.

As for Fred, he steadily grew worse. Not even the influence of that
beautiful little girl could keep him from tapping his secret store; and
soon his condition became such as to attract the skipper's attention.

Fred tumbled down the poop stairs one dog-watch, when all hands were
on deck, and in going forward to execute some task, zigzagged back and
forth.

"Mr. Winters," said the captain to me, "is that young man drunk?"

"I don't know, sir," I answered, resolved not to have a hand in his
undoing.

"My whiskey never was found. Do you think that he has secreted it?"

"Oh, uncle!" said the girl, who had listened. "What are you thinking
of? He is a perfect gentleman; he could not be a drunkard."

The captain still looked at me, waiting for my answer. I was half
resolved to give it truthfully, when a commotion forward forestalled
it. "Git aft where ye b'long, you drunken son of a boardin' master,"
shouted an Irishman of the crew, "an' sind the second mate, if you want
things done shipshape."

He had Fred by the collar, and was marching him ahead at the end of his
extended arm. With a final shove, and a kick, he sent Fred from him,
and went forward.

Fred fell in a heap; then arose, and, with a solemn scowl on his face,
climbed the steps, and joined us at the wheel. The girl looked at him
wonderingly, the skipper disdainfully. Fred's eyes were bleary, and his
walk unsteady; he had assisted his progress aft by leaning on the rail.
