SCENE:
You cant beat itclever as you are! And, however much we may enjoy
enterprise and however many shilling-shockers and penny-dreadfuls we
have devoured, the fact remains, Fay, that you have sadly misapplied
your splendid talents.

Fay took the flattery for what he thought it was worth. He waited with
every sense keen and intent.

But for you, continued Sir Richard, shaking his index-finger, but for
you and your kind, literature would be poorerwell grant that

Fay heard MacKeenon rounding the corner of the table and fingering the
locked boxes.

Well grant it! snapped Sir Richard testily. Well grant your
talents. It is because of them that we have brought you here tonight! As
man to man, Fay, were in a knot. Im sure you are the one rogue in all
the known world who can help us out. Im going to be very candid!

Fay said nothing.

See these? exclaimed Sir Richard, pointing at the boxes upon the
mahogany table. See them?

MacKeenon stepped back into the gloom of the room. Fay followed the
direction of Sir Richards polished fingernail. He raised his brows in
polite query. He still remained mute.

Damnit man! said the chief of the Intelligence Division, Wake up!
Show interest! Its easy enough for us to send you back.

The cracksman acknowledged this threat by leaning closer to the boxes.
He studied the cryptic numbers on their sides. He turned his head
slightly and laid the plaid cap on the edge of the table.

Theyd be easy opened, he offered professionally.

Bah! That isnt what we want. What we want is thiswithout mincing
words. We want your coperation. Lets be brief as time and get to the
heart of the matter. These boxes, three in number, contain the secrets
of the entire dye industry. They were obtained in Switzerland during the
middle period of the war. They are in cipher!

German? asked Fay with cold concern.

Yes, damnit, German! No other nation could show such fiendish cunning
in hiding so simple a thing. The cipher is one to which neither Scotland
Yard, the Intelligence Bureau of the Army and Navy, French experts on
such matters, nor the American Secret Service have been able to find the
slightest clue.

Fay had the good sense to hold his tongue. Sir Richard was warming up to
the problem. He shifted in his chair, glanced at MacKeenon, then toward
the three boxes.

The cipher, he said, tapping the table with his forefinger, is either
very simple or very intricate. It is no half-way affair. It has baffled
all the experts!

The cracksman eyed the locks of the boxes with professional concern. He
shifted his weight from his right leg to his left foot. He yawned
politely and passed his hand over his silver-gray hair. As yet no trust
or warmth showed in his eyes. They were neutral.

Sir Richard adjusted his mask and leaned forward. His eyes bored through
the holes in the black velvet. Whatever the case may be, Fay, he said,
the key for this code or cipher was in the hands of a Berlin chemist
who met with a most violent death inwe will say a country north and
east of here. You can guess which one it is!

Holland?

Perhaps. Well leave the matter rest with your surmise. In
thiscountrynorth and east of here, the German chemist did one thing
before he was slain. He left a small packet with the neutral nations
embassy. It was placed in their care. This packet is of vital importance
to us! It is important to your own country, Fay. It is the key to the
cipher locked in these three boxes.

Well? asked Fay as Sir Richard paused and thrust out his hand. Well,
what have I got to do with all this?

Sir Richard doubled up his fingers and tapped the polished surface of
the table with his white knuckles. He turned, threw one leg over the
other and stared at MacKeenon. The Scotch inspector nodded ever so
slightly. It was like a sly dog signaling another.

The air of the long room was tense as the three men faced each other.
The outer roar of London sounded far away. The steady clank of the
constables feet on the hard curb was a reminder to Fay that the house
was well guarded. He thawed a trifle and fastened upon Sir Richard an
engaging smile which was coated with clean-cut intentiveness.
