SCENE:
Hello there, Roy and Teddy! The two sons of the prairie come to
meet their father, who has been far away in the land of the
snicker-snackers! Greetings! Boys, Ive got a surprise for you.

What is it, Dad? Roy asked, grinning at his father.

A whiffletree, hey, Dad? Teddy inquired.

No, not a whiffletree. Nor a wham-wicker either. Behold! Nell and
Ethel, allow me to present my two dutiful sons, Roy and Teddy.
Pardon me, Theodore! Boys, this is Nell Willis, and this Ethel
Carew. Theyre Peter Balls nieces.

The boys now saw two young girls, of about their own age, who had
just stepped from the train to the platform. Small hats were set
over piquant faces; laughing eyes looked into those of Roy and
Teddy. Somewhat in a daze, the boys acknowledged the introduction.

Yes, went on Mr. Manley, tamping the tobacco gently down into his
pipe, theyre Peter Balls nieces from New York, goin to visit the
8 X 8. Met em on the train. I used to know em a long time ago--
applying a match to the pipe--but they wouldnt remember me. I want
em both to come over and see your sister, Belle Ada, he explained
to the boys. Golly, its good to be back again! Thereat, with a
contented sigh, he blew out a huge cloud of fragrant smoke.

Oh, wed love to come! one of the girls said, she whom Mr. Manley
had introduced as Nell Willis. Then she looked at Roy. You know,
Ive always wanted to come West. I think its so--so weird, dont
you?

Weird? Roy repeated, as though to himself. You mean--weird? Oh,
yes! Sure! Awfully weird! Yep! Sure is!

And do you ride just all the time? the other, Ethel Carew, asked
Teddy.

Who, me? Nope! Sit down to eat, and Teddy grinned. Nice eyes the
girl had.

Hows your mother? Mr. Manley interrupted.

Fine, Roy answered, turning to his father. Shell be glad to see
you again. Shes been a little lonesome.

No trouble? his father asked quickly. I heard something about
rustlers getting away with some of the 8 X 8 stock. Man on the train
told me. They havent been around our place, have they?

Not that I know of, Roy replied. I guess mothers been a bit
upset ever since--er-- He glanced over at Teddy, who was explaining
to Ethel Carew why they called a cowboy a puncher. Ever since you
had that fuss with Gilly Froud, Roy went on. Shes always sort of
afraid hell come back and do some damage.

Mr. Manley scowled and removed his pipe from his mouth.

He better not let me catch him around the X Bar X, he said
sternly. And if hes wise, hell steer clear of Teddy, too. Froud
may be big, but I wouldnt bet a plugged nickel on him if Teddy ever
saw him kick Flash again.

Oh, Mr. Manley, did I hear some one say something about rustlers?
exclaimed Nell Willis. Id just _love_ to see a real, live rustler.
Did you ever shoot one, Mr. Manley?

Who, me? Shoot a rustler? Roys father demanded. Then he saw that
Nell was looking at Roy. Oh, you mean him. I thought you were
talkin to me. Thats Roy, there.

The girl reddened slightly.

Roy, then! And you call me Nell. But tell me--did you ever shoot a
rustler--Roy?

No, I cant say that I did, Roy answered, with a laugh. But if
youd like it, Ill try to arrange to do it for you, and he laughed
again.

Oh, no! Nell replied with a pretended shiver. I dont want you to
do it. I just wondered if you _had_.

Roys only joking, Mr. Manley stated. People back East think
weve got nothing to do but chase Indians and string up
hoss-thieves. Why, even if there were Indians runnin around loose,
we wouldnt have time to chase em. We have plenty to do on a ranch
without lookin for trouble, he declared. That reminds me,
Teddy--whos doin most of the outridin these days? Outriding was
the process of investigating the condition of the stock on the
range.
