SCENE:
XVII
AN OLD-TIME SEANCE AMIDST OLD-TIME SCENES AND OLD-TIME FOLKS


When the tea things had been carried away and stowed with the washed and
shining dishes in the cupboard at one side of the room, the floor swept,
and the apartments made tidy, Lissa ushered into it, as first to arrive,
Mr. Jenkinson and Mrs. Jenkinson and their mother, Mrs. Price.

They were English people, and firm converts to spiritism, Mrs. Price
being so absorbed in it as to appear of unbalanced mind. Mrs. Jenkinson
had a delicate constitution and a nervous temperament, which made her
easily excited and wrought upon. Already she figured as a medium.

They were soon joined by Solomon Garrett, a stoutly built farmer of the
neighborhood, who had, several years before this, come from Scotland
with a party of Mormon emigrants. When met by the plural-marriage
doctrine he had renounced his faith and refused to continue his journey
to Salt Lake City. Subsequently he had located on the Nebraska plain.
His conversion to this new creed of spiritism had been recent and
half-hearted.

With him were the Pemberton twins, two pale, fair-haired young ladies,
who looked so exactly alike as to appear one and the same person. No one
except their mother could identify them, and it was said that in their
childhood she was liable to whip Clementina for the sins of Seraphina.

The young ladies themselves seemed to enjoy the confusion they caused,
and dressed always in twin gowns, imitating closely each others
speeches and gestures. It has been asserted on the best of authority,
their own words and their mothers, that if one was ill the other one
was likewise affected. And since they had become spiritists they claimed
to have been visited by the same visions and communications.

Following the Pemberton twins came the McCleary family, whom I shall
more fully describe.

Those present were the father, mother, son, George and daughter Esther.

Mr. McCleary was a small, quiet, pale, sleek, red-eyed, inoffensive
little man, usually known as Mrs. McClearys husband. He seemed to feel
it his bounden duty to affirm all his wifes statements, and when asked
a question had a way of casting an imploring glance at her,as if
begging her to answer for him, which she usually did,but who, so far as
known, was a kind, indulgent father to his children, and an honest and
industrious neighbor. When not otherwise engaged, Mr. McCleary might be
found amusing himself with a planchette. With it he talked, reasoned,
and speculated upon the problem of life. Sometimes he whispered to the
partner of his bosom certain wonderful secrets which he believed the
planchette had imparted to him. Andthey were secrets no longer.

Mrs. McCleary was a short, well-preserved woman of the fat, fair and
forty type. She had remarkable black eyes, blue-black, waving hair, and
very white, plump hands, with which she continually gesticulated to
accompany the unceasing flow of words from her tongue. Her speech
retained enough of the Irish brogue to make it pleasant to the ear.

Mrs. McCleary imagined herself an invalid, though no one, not even
herself, could determine the nature of the malady with which she was
afflicted. It seemed to be rather a delicacy of constitution than any
pronounced illness. Some of her neighbors were uncharitable enough to
remark that if Mrs. McCleary were to receive some shock that would rouse
her from the helpless state she fancied herself to be in she would be as
well and strong as any one.

George McCleary, an undergraduate from an Eastern college, was in no way
remarkable, but Esther was the hundredth woman, whose influence was felt
throughout the little community.

She was but a slight, delicately built girl of eighteen years, yet what
a marvel of diligence and endurance.

In the McCleary family there were six children younger than herself, and
upon Esther devolved almost the entire care and responsibility of the
household, a responsibility which she accepted uncomplainingly and
discharged faithfully.

Esther was pretty and more than pretty. She was interesting. There was
in her face a sweetness and brightness of expression that charmed all
who met her, and won their affection. Then, too, she was one of those to
whom all turn for instruction and advice. She knew how to do things.
From the fashioning of a gown to the most intricate fancywork, as well
as the rarer concoctions in the culinary department, Esther was the most
competent authority in the neighborhood.

Nor did her usefulness end here. In the sick room she was unequaled. A
most uncommon handy person to have around, one of the good fathers in
the community had said, and perhaps that best expressed her
qualifications. God bless the handy person.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with the arrival of the English family of Mr. Jenkinson, Mrs. Jenkinson, and their mother, Mrs. Price. They are soon joined by Scottish farmer Solomon Garrett and the Pemberton twins. The group is completed by the McCleary family, consisting of father, mother, son George, and daughter Esther.
All present are spiritists, except for Garrett, who is a recent convert. Mrs. Price is especially absorbed in the creed, to the point of appearing unbalanced. Mrs. Jenkinson is a nervous medium. The Pemberton twins are so identical that even their mother has trouble telling them apart. They claim to share the same visions and communications since becoming spiritists.
Mr. McCleary is a small, quiet man who usually lets his wife do the talking. He is an honest and hard-working neighbor, and spends his free time with a planchette. Mrs. McCleary is a short, plump woman with black eyes and blue-black hair. She is always talking and imagines herself to be an invalid.
George McCleary is an unremarkable college student, but his sister Esther is the center of the community. She is only eighteen, but she is responsible for the care of her six younger siblings and the running of the household. She is also a skilled seamstress, cook, and nurse.
The scene ends with a general description of the setting and the characters.
