Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
He tossed her grip into the back of the car, along with his own, and
turned to help her to the seat beside the driver. For just an instant
she hesitated, then with a bitter, choking little laugh gave way. What
else could she do? It was merely another ironic blow of fate that the
lover she had discarded should be the man to help her fly from the
destiny her wilfulness had invited.

In silence they sat knee to knee while the car rolled the miles. The
distant hills and valleys which slid indistinguishably into each other
detached themselves as they approached, took on individuality, vanished
in the dusty rear.

Neither of them welcomed the chance that had thrown them together again.
It shocked the pride of the woman, put her under an obligation to the
man against whom she had nursed resentment for years. His presence
stressed the degradation into which she seemed to herself to have
fallen. For him, too, the meeting was untimely. To-day of all days he
wanted to forget the past, to turn over a page that was to begin the
story of a new record. Deliberately he had shut the door on the story of
his unhappy love for Norma Davis, and with an impish grin fate had flung
it open again.

The heady wilfulness of the girl had given place to the tight-lipped
self-repression of a suffering woman. Not once in all the years had she
complained to an outsider. But her flight was a confession. The stress
of her feeling overflowed into words bitter and stinging.

Youve got your revenge, Rowan McCoy. If I treated you shabbily you can
say I told you so now. They used to say I was too proud. Maybe I was.
Well, Ive been paid for it a thousand times. Ive got mighty little to
be proud of to-day.

Norma! he pleaded in a low voice.

With the instinct of one who bites on an ulcerated tooth to accent the
pain, she drew up a loose sleeve and showed him blue-and-yellow bruises.

Look! she ordered in an ecstasy of self-contempt. Ive hidden this
sort of thing for yearsand worsea hundred times worse.

The hound! His strong, clenched teeth smothered the word.

Instantly the mood of the woman changed. She would have none of his
sympathy.

Im a fool, she snapped. Ive made my bed. Ill lie in it. This world
wasnt built for women, anyhow. Why should I complain?

Never a talkative man, McCoy said nothing now.

They had reached the Fryingpan, and the road wound down beside the
little river as it tumbled toward the plains over bowlders and around
them. The trout were feeding, and occasionally one leaped for a fly, a
flash of silver in the sunlight. Both of them recalled vividly the time
they had last gone fishing here. They had taken a picnic lunch, and it
had been on the way home that a quarrel had flashed between them about
the attentions of Joe Tait to her. That night she had eloped.

The woman noticed that McCoy was not wearing to-day the broad-rimmed
white felt hat and the wrinkled corduroys that were so much an
expression of his personality. He was in a new, dark suit, new shoes,
and an up-to-date straw hat. The suitcase that jostled her shabby
telescope valise would have done credit to a Chicago travelling
salesman.

Youre going to take the train, she suggested.

To Cheyenne, he answered.

Why, Im going to Laramie, if

She cut her sentence short. It was not to be presumed that he cared
where she was going. Moreover, she could not finish without telling more
than she wanted to. But McCoy guessed the condition. She would go if she
could borrow at Wagon Wheel the money for a ticket.

They drove into the county seat long before train time.

Where shall I take you? he asked.

To Moodys, if you will.

He helped her from the car and carried the valise into the store. Moody
was in the cubby-hole that had been cut off from the store for an
office. Rowan hailed him cheerfully.

Look here, Trent. Whats the best price you can give me for those
hides? He walked toward the storekeeper and bargained with him audibly,
but he found time to slip in an undertone: If Mrs. Tait wants any
money, give it to her. Ill be responsible. But dont tell her I said
so.
