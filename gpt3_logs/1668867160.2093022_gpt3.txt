Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
Early in the second morning I came within sight of the stockade about
the mines. Even at a distance I could see that it was a weak,
dilapidated thing and that the sentries pacing along its top were all
that held the prisoners within. As a matter of fact, many escaped; but
they were soon hunted down and killed as the farmers in the neighborhood
always informed on them, since the commandant at the prison had
conceived the fiendish plan of slaying one farmer for every prisoner who
escaped and was not recaught.

I hid until night and then cautiously I approached the stockade, leaving
Red Lightning securely tied in the woods. It was no trick to reach the
stockade, so thoroughly was I hidden by the rank vegetation growing upon
the outside. From a place of concealment I watched the sentry, a big
fellow, but apparently a dull clod who walked with his chin upon his
breast and with the appearance of being half asleep.

The stockade was not high and the whole construction was similar to that
of the prison pen at Chicago, evidently having been designed by the same
commandant in years gone by. I could hear the prisoners conversing in
the shed beyond the wall and presently, when one came near to where I
listened, I tried to attract his attention by making a hissing sound.

After what seemed a long time to me, he heard me; but even then it was
some time before he appeared to grasp the idea that someone was trying
to attract his attention. When he did he moved closer and tried to peer
through one of the cracks; but as it was dark outside he could see
nothing.

Are you a Yank? I asked. If you are, I am a friend.

I am a Yank, he replied. Did you expect to find a Kalkar working in
the mines?

Do you know a prisoner called Julian 8th? I inquired.

He seemed to be thinking for a moment and then he said: I seem to have
heard the name. What do you want of him?

I want to speak to himI am his son.

Wait! he whispered. I think that I heard a man speak that name today.
I will find outhe is near by.

I waited for perhaps ten minutes when I heard someone approaching from
the inside and presently a voice asked if I was still there.

Yes, I said; is that you, Father? for I thought that the tones were
his.

Julian, my son! came to me almost as a sob. What are you doing here?

Briefly I told him and then of my plan. Have the convicts the courage
to attempt it? I asked in conclusion.

I do not know, he said, and I could not but note the tone of utter
hopelessness in his voice. They would wish to; but here our spirits and
our bodies both are broken. I do not know how many would have the
courage to attempt it. Wait and I will talk with some of themall are
loyal; but just weak from overwork, starvation and abuse.

I waited for the better part of an hour before he returned. Some will
help, he said, from the first, and others if we are successful. Do you
think it worth the riskthey will kill you if you failthey will kill
us all.

And what is death to that which you are suffering? I asked.

I know, he said; but the worm impaled upon the hook still struggles
and hopes for life. Turn back, my son, we can do nothing against them.

I shall not turn back, I whispered. I shall not turn back.

I will help you; but I cannot speak for the others.

We had spoken only when the sentry had been at a distance, falling into
silence each time he approached the point where we stood. In the
intervals of silence I could hear the growing restlessness of the
prisoners and I guessed that what I had said to the first man was being
passed around from mouth to mouth within until already the whole
adjacent shed was seething with something akin to excitement. I wondered
if it would arouse their spirit sufficiently to carry them through the
next ten minutes. If it did, success was assured.

Father had told me all that I wanted to knowthe location of the guard
house and the barracks and the number of Kash Guard posted hereonly
fifty men to guard five thousand! How much more eloquently than words
did this fact bespeak the humiliation of the American people and the
utter contempt in which our scurvy masters held usfifty men to guard
five thousand!
