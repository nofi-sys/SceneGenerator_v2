SCENE:
XIII


IT was a cold, damp day in the middle of February. Paris had for the
moment borrowed a fog from her neighbour across the Channel; and
habituated as she is to sunlight and clear air, she looked dirtier and
far less comfortable than consistently and imperturbably grimy London.

It is the kind of day, said Romain DUcelles, looking out of the
window, in which one might as well do ones duty; anything else
would be equally unpleasant. My angel, he added to his wife over his
shoulder, do you require the motor this morning?

Yes, said Madame DUcelles, without looking up from her
correspondence.

But I am desolated, said Romain, because I shall have to deprive
you. I am about to go out in it myself.

In that case, said Madame, you might have spared me your offer!

I dont think it was exactly an offer, said Romain, with a
thoughtful smile. I merely wished to show you a little graceful
consideration. You should, of course, have said that you did not want
the motor, and then you might always have believed in the consistency
of my good intentions. But alas! you have acquired that fatal habit of
saying the wrong thing! It is a habit that goes with economy and all
the domestic virtues. It explains much, and you will forgive me I know,
my dear Marie, if I say that I think it excuses more!

I dont know what you mean, said his wife coldly, but the bills you
have been running up lately are simply disgraceful. Here are three
from the florists. I dont ask where you send these flowers, but the
account comes to more than a thousand francs!

Dear, dear! said Romain, humming a tune. Do you not remember, my
life, that I bought you some on the anniversary of our wedding? That
was an expensive affair, I grant you!

Marie shot a glance of rage at her husband; she would have liked it
to be hatred, and she often thought it was; but he had too charming a
smile.

The expense of that affair, she said bitterly, was altogether my
own!

Do not let us quarrel, my adorable one, murmured Romain, who by now
had reached the door. It sounds as if we were on our honeymoon. But
there is, you know, after all, more than one way of being expensive!

There you speak truly, said Madame, and you have shown me them all!

Romain laughed out at this sally, and under cover of his laughter
brought off his retreat. He enjoyed an occasional conversation with
his wife; he said that it added so to the charm of the conversation of
other women.

It was three weeks since he had received Miss Prenderghasts letter
imploring him to do his duty about Jean. He had been extremely amused
and a trifle annoyed by it; during the three weeks the annoyance had
worn off, and now only the amusement was left. He rang for the motor
and drove at once to Jeans new address.

Margot opened the door to him. She was quite overwhelmed by the
gorgeous person in the fur-lined overcoat who asked for Jean. This was
the first of Jeans friends who had called upon him, except his fellow
artists, and Margot had not a high opinion of artists.

Romain looked at her with amused eyes under his heavy eyelids. So this
was the successor of Liane de Brances! he thought. Pretty, decidedly,
but not worth six flights of stairs.

Aloud he said he was shocked at having given her so much trouble; he
should suppose from the loud sounds over the way that his nephew was
practising his new and rather noisy career?

Yes, I think he is, said Margot flushing delicately.

Romain gave her a charming confidential smile. My dear child,
he said,--you will allow me this familiarity, for I feel that we
already know each other through Jean--do not, I beg of you, encourage
this career! Oh, yes! You see I know your influence is great. It is
delightful for my nephew to be here, and your room--well! one can see
you have a taste. But you want to do what is best for him, do you not?

Oh, yes, yes! said Margot, with a quick catch in her breath. Only
indeed you mistake; I have no influence, none at all!

Come, come! said Romain, laughing. Do you want me to believe my
nephew a perfect fool? I grant you this piano-playing is an absurdity,
but if that is his only attraction here, I must give him up altogether.
I assure you, you under rate his judgment! I could prove to you very
speedily, Mademoiselle, that such judgment as that does not run in
our family, but I greatly fear I must leave pleasure for duty, and go
in to my nephew. I can count on you, though, can I not, to support my
plans for him? They dont exclude, I assure you, his having charming
friendships!


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Romain and Margot, and to set up the conflict between them. Romain is a charming but selfish man, more interested in his own pleasure than in the welfare of his nephew, Jean. Margot is a young woman who is obviously attracted to Jean, and who is also interested in his welfare. Romain is trying to manipulate Margot into helping him convince Jean to give up his new career as a musician.
