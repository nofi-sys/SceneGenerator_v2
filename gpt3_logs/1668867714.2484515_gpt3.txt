SCENE:
XX THE END OF THE CRUISE--CONCLUSION


In the morning the voyage was resumed, but they did not hurry, it being
the purpose of Captain Shooks to let the _Dauntless_ have plenty of
time to reach the Pacific and go on. If they should find her hovering
around as though waiting for them, nothing could be more simple with
regard to getting rid of the rival boat than for them to submerge, and
keep moving under the water until night came on.

This time they were meaning to head further south. They had a pretty
accurate account of an old-time buccaneer that had preyed upon the gold
coast with impunity, until finally it ran upon a disguised British
sloop of war, which proceeded to hammer it so well that in the end the
pirate sank. The account also stated, on the authority of competent
witnesses who had left a record behind them before they passed away,
that the notorious commander of the buccaneer had all his wealth on
board at the time, it being his intention to give up the nefarious
business, and settle down under an assumed name in some Continental
country, there to enjoy the ill-gotten fruits of his many sackings of
towns and ships.

Of course, all that amazing treasure went down with the ship, though
some of the crew, it appears, did manage to swim ashore and escape.
Many unsuccessful attempts had been made to find the sunken piratical
vessel, but then none of these were one-half so well fixed for
exploring the bottom of the sea as the one Captain Shooks commanded.

So with ardent hopes they pointed the prow of their odd-looking boat
toward the Peruvian coast, and in due time reached their destination.
It proved to be by long odds the toughest job they had as yet
undertaken, owing to the diverse ocean currents they struck after they
had gone down to investigate.

For days they prowled around that region. When one clue failed the
skipper seemed to have another at hand, upon which he depended to show
them the object of their persistent hunt.

Jack was having the time of his life taking pictures of all the amazing
things they discovered while prosecuting this search. He added several
films to his already wonderful collection, and only feared his supply
would run short before the subjects gave out, and wished he had waited
at Panama for the new lot ordered shipped on from New York.

As time passed, and no reward came to their labors, even the confident
Ballyhoo began to despair of meeting with success.

I guess the Pacific is our hoodoo, fellows, he was telling them on
one occasion, as they sat on the edge of the lower bunk, or it might be
a stool, for chairs were at a premium in those close quarters. After
all wed better be cutting stick, and going back to the Caribbean Sea,
where we did meet with our usual good luck.

Heres the skipper coming to tell us something, remarked Jack, and
from the look on his face I guess its good news in the bargain.

Three to one hes decided to clear out of this mess, and get through
the canal again to where we know our ground, ventured Ballyhoo
confidently.

However, Ballyhoo was wrong for once. Captain Shooks had information of
an altogether different nature to communicate.

Weve stopped moving, he started to say, and in a cleared spot just
ahead, where our illuminator makes every little object stand out like
daylight, weve discovered something that tells us a vessel must have
gone to pieces about here. The fragments look like an old-time anchor,
for one thing, and some other metal parts.

Then you think, do you, asked Oscar, sensing the meaning conveyed
in these words of the skipper, were about on the spot where that
pirate sank; and that shes been washed around in these currents until
nothings left of her hulk?

Thats just what Im afraid of, lad, admitted the other; and that
well have come down here on a fools errand. However, now that were
on the spot we must try as hard as we can to learn the truth.

Soon they had arisen again to the surface, and placed a buoy to mark
the spot, so they could come again; for just then there was too much
sea running to think of making use of a float.

After waiting there for two days the skipper could not stand any
further delay; so it was arranged that one of the expert divers go
down from the forward deck of the submersible, which, being low down
near the water, might be made to answer the purpose temporarily. If
he struck anything that promised good results they would linger still
longer, waiting for the weather to change.

This plan was put into operation, though with much difficulty, and not
a little added risk. But the diver knew no fear, and was soon down on
the bottom, moving around, and looking for signs to tell the fate of
the once notorious pirate ship.
