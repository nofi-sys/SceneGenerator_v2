SCENE:
XII


The attempted burglary at the American Embassy made quite a stir, not
only in Berlin but in America. That it did not make a greater one was
due to the fact that no one except Rutile and Topham suspected that it
was anything more than the simple attempt at burglary that it seemed;
and both Rutile and Topham had their own reasons for concealing their
suspicions.

The attempt was therefore ascribed simply to a desire for plunder;
that it might have political significance was not even publicly
suggested. So far as Rutile knew, Risdon was the only one to smell
even the smallest rat; and Risdon, having absolutely no information
concerning the letter Topham had brought, knew nothing that connected
Ouro Preto with the incident. He therefore found so little on which to
base a story, that he cabled only a vague surmise that nobody paid any
attention to.

But despite the fact that few people suspected any particular mystery
in the motive, everybody took a very great interest in the crime. The
dead man was plainly not a common thief. His clothing was good and his
person showed evidences of refinement. He was unknown to the police,
and was therefore presumably not a member of the ordinary criminal
classes. Very obviously, too, he had been murdered by his companion to
do away with any chance that he might betray that companions identity.

Few criminals go so far as to murder a pal under such circumstances,
and from this it was argued that the accomplice must be a man who
had much more than the ordinary at stake. In other words, it seemed
very probable that he was a Raffles in real life. Naturally, such a
suggestion was nuts to the newspaper men and they used it to the full.

Topham and Rutile shrank from discussing the subject with each other,
and from resuming the broken-off conversation of the night before. It
was easy enough to avoid further talk at first. The police had come
promptly and had done what they had to do with neatness and dispatch.
But it all took time and when it was over the dawn was at hand and the
two young men went off to their beds, glad of the excuse to postpone
explanations.

But Topham could not stay away from the Embassy all the next day. He
was leaving in the afternoon and to absent himself would have been more
significant than anything he could say. So about noon he went to the
embassy, uncertain just what he would say but resolved not to shirk any
question that might rightfully be asked of him.

As he approached the door he saw Caesar standing on the steps staring
around him with wildly rolling eyeballs. Evidently he was looking for
someone, but as his eyes passed over Topham without pausing, the latter
did not guess that he himself was the object of the darkeys solicitude.

Only when he was quite near he spoke. Well, Caesar! he questioned,
Cant you find him?

Find who? The negro whirled round. Fore Gord, Massa Topham! Whar
you come from. If I aint been a-lookin an a-lookin foh you! Massa
Rutiles mighty anxious to see you, suh. Please to walk up to his room,
suh. Please, suh!

Topham ascended the stairs slowly and pushed open the door of the
secretarys office.

Rutile was bending over a huge atlas, but when the navy officer entered
he pushed it aside. Hello! Topham, he called. I was getting anxious
about you. Your train goes pretty soon, doesnt it?

Topham nodded. In an hour or so, he answered, quietly.

I thought as much. Well! We havent much time to waste and I will
come right to the point. I want you to believe that what I am going
to say I say as a representative of the United States to an officer
of the United States Navy. I dont want to pry into your affairs. But
I do want all the information I can get about the Count of Ouro Preto
and his sister--No! let me go on--Risdon told me of your agitation on
meeting the countess on the street yesterday. I know myself that you
are interested in her. I know, too, that Ouro Preto was trying to pump
you last night. We both know more about your trip across the ocean
than we perhaps care to say. We both suspect much about that so-called
burglary. But the point of it all is that the United States is greatly
interested in this Ouro Preto matter--in anything that concerns
Germany and Brazil for that matter. I have seen Lord Maxwell. He is
positive that Ouro Preto saw the emperor last night and he believes
that the Kaiser has offered to recognize his claims to that dukedom
on conditions. What these conditions are I dont know, and it may be
important that I should. You are leaving for Japan and will be out of
the way later. Now, cant you tell me anything that would throw light
on the matter?

On the question of the dukedom? he asked. Not a thing. Absolutely
nothing!
