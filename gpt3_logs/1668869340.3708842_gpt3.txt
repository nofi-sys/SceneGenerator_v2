Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Carlotta was put to death at about the moment of His arrest by the
Pituba officer, before he was taken to Ribote.

On the fate of Don Manuel and his army, or what happened on the
day of the battle.

When Hi saw the White army near Anselmo, it was moving from its bivouac
towards Santa Barbara, expecting to fight that morning. It was delayed
in its march by Pituba skirmishers, so that it did not come into
position above Santa Clara until after three in the afternoon.

Don Manuel had expected that a part of the Federal army, the San Jacinto
Horse, and the battalion of Independents, would declare for him, and
either join him or help him. Their officers were known to be Whites and
their men were hostile to Lopez. Unfortunately, Colonel Velarte, of the
Horse, who was a friend of Hermengildo de Bazan, the White leader,
disliked Don Manuel and refused to help him. The Colonel of the
Independents felt that the Whites would be ruined if he did not help Don
Manuel, but would not help unless he were given the command. While
affairs were in this state, the day before the battle, Don Livio
disarmed both these battalions and put their officers under arrest, so
that the Whites were not helped by any Federal troops.

When the battle began, Don Manuel had with him between six and seven
hundred horsemen, armed in various ways, undisciplined, without
artillery, and almost without ammunition. The Federal troops opposed to
him numbered about four thousand, including the Meruel and Pituba
regiments of horse, three battalions of Eastern foot and two batteries
of horse artillery.

The battle proper began when Don Manuels men came on to the little
ridge above Santa Clara church. At that point they came under shell-fire
from the batteries, which had been registered upon the ground during the
morning. As Don Manuel saw that his only chance was to charge the guns,
he charged. His men got into trip wire laid before the guns, and were
shot down there by the foot soldiers or routed by the lancers. Some
fifty or sixty of the Encinitas men followed Don Manuel to the right of
the field, broke through a squad of Meruel horse, made a dash for the
city, entered the southern gate, and summoned the fortress to surrender.

Here, through the wit of Don Livio, they were ambushed and driven on to
the water-front, where they fought till they were lost. The last of them
made a stand about the green boat or lighter which Hi had seen on the
morning of his setting out with Rosa. When their last cartridges were
gone, they took to the water and were killed in the bay.

Don Manuel, because he took to the water after the others, when the
light was worse, contrived to reach the English barque _Venturer_, whose
Captain (Gary) received him and brought him to safety. Some five weeks
after the battle, he landed in the United States.

Of his army, it is thought that about one-half escaped alive from the
battle, and that of these perhaps a third were killed in the pursuit or
in the proscriptions which followed. The Federal loss is not known, as
the returns were falsified. It is thought that the Reds lost many men in
the skirmishing, both before and after the battle.

The battlefield, which was then mainly race ground and market gardens,
is now covered by the suburb of Santa Clara. It is a couple of miles
from Medinas, on the northern road from the city; at a little distance
the ridge (now covered with houses) which was the White position, may
still be seen.

On the fate of Donna Emilia and her daughter Rosa.

Donna Emilia died in misery shortly after the outbreak of the troubles
(in May, 1887). Her daughter, Rosa Piranha, though proscribed in the
September massacre, was saved from death by the devotion of her old
nurse. The house which Hi saw burning, as he walked to the Mole, was not
the Piranhas home; that was spared though sacked. Rosa returned to it
when the troubles were over.

In May, 1888, she entered a community of enclosed nuns, to whom she made
over all her earthly possessions. In this sisterhood she has lived ever
since.

On the fate of Hi, after he went on board the _Solita_.

As the aliens in the ships were not allowed to land again in Santa
Barbara during the troubles, Hi, with his fellow refugees, went in the
_Solita_ to New York, where he landed.

As his parents felt that he had better stay there, he remained in the
United States, where he underwent the adventures and hardships usual to
youth. After some months there, it happened, that he met Don Manuel.

As he felt that his life was linked to Don Manuel by ties not easily
broken, he joined the band of White refugees sworn to destroy Don Lopez
and his faction. With these outcasts he wandered and suffered for some
months, till that campaign began which led to the killing of Lopez and
the establishment of Don Manuel as Dictator in his stead.
