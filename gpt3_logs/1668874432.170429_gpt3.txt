SCENE:
XXVI


AN EXPLANATION

AS Tim Flanders had predicted, the establishment of government forest
reserves changed the equation that faced the cattleman. The open range
was doomed, but federal supervision brought with it compensations. One
of these was that the man who ran cattle on the reserve need not fear
overstocking nor the competition of Marys Little Lamb. The market was
in a better condition than it had been for years. The price of beef was
high, and was still on the rise. Nor was there any prospect of a slump,
since the supply in the country was not equal to the demand.

Ruth had every reason to feel satisfied. Her shipment of beef steers had
brought a top price at the Denver stockyards. The opportune sale of a
house from her aunts estate made it possible for her to pay the debts
that had accumulated from Rowans trial and to reduce a little the
mortgage on the Circle Diamond. The hay-cutting in the meadow had run to
a fair average, and already she had in one hundred acres of winter
wheat.

She had worked hard and steadily, so that when one afternoon Jennings
brought back from the post office a letter from Rowan his young mistress
decided to ride up into the hills and read it where she could be alone
among the pines. An earned holiday is a double delight. As the
pintoone that Rowan himself had gentled for his bridepicked his way
into the caon mouth through blue-spiked larkspur and rabbit bush in
golden splashes the girl in the saddle was nearer happy than she had
been for many a day. Her lovers letter lay warm against her breast, all
the joy of reading it still before her. The sky was blue as babies eyes
except where a shoal of mackerel clouds floated lazily westward. A
meadow-lark throbbed out its full-throated bliss. Robins and bluebirds
exulted in the sunshine. Already the quivering leaves of a grove of
young, quaking asps that marched up from the trail to the rock wall were
golden with the touch of autumn.

In a pine grove on a sunny slope Ruth read his letter, the tessellated
light all about her in warm, irregular patterns. To read what he had
written was to see the face of love. It filled her with deep joy,
brought with it a peace that was infinitely comforting. She wept a
little over it thankfully, though every word carried good cheer.

He was allowed to write only once a week, and everything he sent out was
censored. But each letter told her a little more than she had known
before of the man she had married. When she had vowed to cleave to him
through good and ill fortune he had been a stranger to her. In some ways
he still was, just as no doubt she was to him. For underneath the tricks
of manner that had charmed him and captured his imagination, what had he
discerned of the real woman sleeping in her? As for Ruth, she had
married Rowan because of her keenness for the great adventure, Life, of
which she supposed love to be a large part.

It had been a little cross to her that he was uneducated in the schools,
that he could not parrot the literary patter to which she was
accustomed. He spoke and he wrote fairly correctly. Once he had
surprised her by a reference which showed her he knew his Scott
intimately. But the moderns were closed books to him.

In the last paragraphs of his letter was a reference that showed her his
mind went straight to the relation that lies between literature and
life. His letter concluded:

You must not worry about me, dear. Whatever happens, it is all
right. From the night that we rode on the raid until I said
good-bye to you, I was tied hand and foot in a web of lies. That
is all past. I cant explain it, but somehow all the kinks have
straightened out. I would give anything to be back home, so as
to look after you. But except for that, I am at peace.

From the prison library I got some poems by a man called
Browning. Its queer, mixed-up stuff. I couldnt make head or
tail of some of it, but every once in a while he whangs out a
verse that grades way up. Take this:

The best is yet to be,
The last of life, for which the first was made;
Our times are in His hand
Who said: A whole I planned,
Youth shows but half; trust God; see all, nor be afraid.

Ever since I came here I had been thinking that myself, but I
didnt know how to say it like he does. Most poets spill a heap
of language, looks like to me, but this fellow throws a straight
rope. Our times are in His Hands! Im banking a heap on that,
honey. No need to fearjust trust and wait. Some day our
waiting will be over.

Dusk had fallen before Ruth rode down the trail to the ranch, her spirit
still with Rowan up in the pines.
