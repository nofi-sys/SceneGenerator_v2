SCENE:
Whats the new one? inquired Larry. Whats the gang all pullin
faces about?

Keep yer eyes on Kelly, cautioned Goose. Hes been puttin away
booze all night, and he wants to see you about the girl what you
flagged at the door.

Oh! Larry shoved his head forward in a bull-like movement and stared
about him. Does he want some o my game, eh? Is the lobster spoilin
to mix it up with me? Therell be ony two blows struck; Ill hit him,
and hell hit the floor!

Mike McCarty came out of the barroom and approached them, crossing the
floor in the midst of the dancers. A girls swinging skirts almost
wrapped themselves about him, as her partner piloted her by.

Ah, there, Mike? cried the lady, gleefully, and McCarty bowed like a
Chesterfield, never pausing in his stride, however, until he reached
the spot where Goose and Larry were talking.

Kellys comin across, said he pointing among the dancing throng. He
just seen youse a minit ago, and hes goin to lay you out, so he says.

Larry growled an answer deep down in his chest; he was looking at Kelly
and his two allies as they swaggered through the dancers. McGonagle
rapped out a vexed oath, as he caught Larry by the arm.

I tought, complained he, that wed pull off this affair witout any
scrappin; and here them mugs spoils it all. Say, if theres a fight,
Annie wont do a ting but climb down me back fer fetchin her.

My girl too, said McCarty, dolefully.

Come out in the entry, pleaded Goose. Dont scare the women!

Larry reluctantly went with them, casting glances over his shoulder at
his prospective opponent.

The mugll tink Im afraid o him, said he. When they reached the
entry he tugged viciously at the breast of his dress coat. Damn it,
growled he, savagely, the ting aint got no buttons on! I dont want
to get no blood on me shirt front.

Keep yer eyes on Foley, whispered Mike to McGonagle. Ill look out
for Daily.

Dye tink ye kin hold him even? He pulls the beam fifty pounds moren
youse.

I wouldnt care, smiled Mike, if he was as big as the side o a
house. The bigger he is the harder hell fall.

Yousere a nice-lookin pill, aint ye? were Kellys first words.
Floor Manager, too, sneeringly; why, youse dont know a lady when ye
see one.

Shes crooked! remarked Larry, and youse know she is.

Youre a liar, snarled Martin. And even if she is, shes better than
some women I know of. She dont live with--

He did not finish but leaped back and threw up his guard. Larry, his
face wrinkling with a grin, was upon him, striking with the speed,
precision and power of a practiced boxer. The exchange was heavy and
rapid. The men panted and laboured for breath, cursing each other
between their teeth. The policemen were clattering up the steps from
the lower passage; the doorway leading to the ballroom was banked solid
with the strained, anxious faces of partisans; women screamed shrilly;
the music stopped with a crash.

Suddenly Larry slipped and fell upon one knee; Foley made a quick,
wicked kick at his side, and the next instant was thrown against the
wall by the force of a smashing blow from McGonagle. Mike McCarty was
staring eagerly into Dailys face, his body quivering like that of a
crouching cat, when the officers arrived.

Fire em out, commanded McGonagle. Fire the tree o them!

The offenders were promptly hustled down the stairs and out upon the
sidewalk. A light rain was falling; the arc lamps sputtered and hissed
in the silence. A form wrapped in a blue mackintosh, and holding an
umbrella, was standing upon the steps.

Here he is, laughed the policeman who held Martin; and I didnt have
to tell him he was wanted, either.

The three ejected ones stared curiously at the woman; and the policeman
laughed again and closed the door.

Mart, said the woman, I want to talk to you.
