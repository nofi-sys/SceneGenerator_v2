Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
An anchor was silently let go, and the submarine lay there, all snug
and secure. The boys hastened to get on deck to secure a breath of pure
air before seeking their bunks for the balance of the night.

It was just as dark as ever; indeed, after being accustomed to the
powerful light that had been used while they were below it seemed worse
than before to Ballyhoo, who rubbed his eyes and whimpered that he
feared he must be going blind, for somehow he just couldnt see a thing
around him.

They had been warned not to converse above whispers, which instructions
all of them faithfully carried out. Sounds carry wonderfully over the
water, as they very well knew; an oar striking against the side of a
rowboat makes a noise that can be heard a mile away, according to the
condition of the atmosphere at the time.

Look up, and youll see the stars, Oscar told him. But it is
terribly black around here. I can just barely manage to find where the
island lies.

You dont happen to notice any lights ashore, do you? asked Ballyhoo,
as though he kept that significant fact constantly on his mind.

Nothing doing, reported the other promptly. If there are people on
the Key, then theyve either gone to sleep, or else for some reason are
keeping under cover.

The night air seemed damp and chilly after being below so long, and,
consequently, the boys soon felt that it would be much more comfortable
down in their snug quarters. Besides, Ballyhoo was yawning as though in
need of sleep.

Im really ashamed of myself to be gaping so, he told the others,
but I just cant help it. Must be something in the sea air around here
that makes me so terribly sleepy.

So they presently left the hurricane deck, and shortly afterwards
crawled into their berths. The last Oscar knew of anything the boat was
gently moving up and down on the long night swell of the sea, broken
somewhat by the Key near at hand.

Then morning came, and once more they were on deck, for the submarine
had remained on the surface, showing that Captain Shooks anticipated no
serious interruption to his work of the day.

Now they could, for the first time, plainly see the little island Coco
Key. It was not much to look at, a mere hump covered with heavy growth
of trees and brush. A few palmettoes, and several beautiful cocoanut
trees stood up above the rest of the vegetation, and the presence of
the latter doubtless accounted for the name that had been given to the
place.

Perhaps it may have been a couple of miles at the most in
circumference, counting all the little bayous along the shore. In
many places the edge of the water was covered with those singular
trees known as mangroves, which can be found all over southern Florida
wherever salt water abounds. Their seed grows in the shape of a catalpa
cigar, so well known to most boys. This drops into the soft mud at
low tide, and roots spring from it in an incredibly short time, so that
another tree is started. Thus they spread and thrive until they form a
veritable thicket.

In Florida at a certain season of the year the leaves seem to exude a
sticky, sweet substance that the bees gather, and which forms the basis
for tons and tons of mangrove honey.

The boys looked long and earnestly at that island. Ballyhoo in
particular seemed to still entertain certain suspicions regarding its
being as peaceful and innocent as outward appearances would indicate.

I see the skipper has sent out the collapsible boat, he went on to
say, almost as soon as they reached the deck; but it doesnt look as
if the two men in the same meant to land on the Key after all, for
theyre rowing off at right angles to the land.

I can give a guess whats in the wind, said Oscar.

Oh! thats easy, added Jack. Captain Shooks wants to make sure that
theres no boat belonging to spongers or turtle hunters anchored on the
other side of the island; so hes sending out his men to row completely
around the same, and make a sure job of it before he starts to work.

Hell have his trouble for his pains, I feel sure, Oscar continued,
because only a fool would anchor his boat on the windward side of a
Key like this, when he had the choice of getting in its lee.

Half an hour later the boat came in sight again, and from the opposite
quarter, showing that the men had, indeed, gone completely around the
Key. They reported the coast as clear, though, of course they had made
no landing. While there were numerous little indentations in the shore
line, still the trees and mangroves were not high enough to conceal a
schooner, or even one of the native boats with a mast.
