SCENE:
And he took it?

Wait. He refused for a long time, and said you would not think of
accepting my money, so at last I pushed it into his hand, and told him
not to say it came from me. He was very reluctant to the last; I expect
he was afraid to give it you and afraid to give it back to me.

Was that the only time he took your money?

No; I gave him some two or three times--not much, of course--and it
made no difference to me, for it was money I had put aside.

And what was that you said about jewelry? Come, Annie, you mustnt
keep back anything! It isnt fair to tell only half.

It is only that once, when I was short of ready money, and anxious, in
spite of poor Stephens entreaties, to send you some, I gave him a pair
of ear-rings and two other little trinkets I never wore, and asked him
to sell them for me.

Harry started up restlessly from the sofa and began marching up and
down; then he stopped short in front of her.

Why didnt you write to me when you got no acknowledgment?

I didnt like to. I thought Stephen had kept from you the fact that
the money came from me.

And you thought I was such a booby as not to have guessed, and such
a bear as not to have thanked you? Annie, that is impossible! You are
hiding something from me still.

But Annie did not answer or look at him. Her eyes were fixed in front
of her, as a new light broke in upon her bewildered mind.

Harry, said she at length, raising her glittering eyes to his with
an expression which was almost fear, those flowers--you sent--by
Stephen--a few days ago----

Oh, did you get those then? He did not condescend to--

Were they for me? she asked, in a low voice.

For you! Of course they were for you; who else should they be for?
said Harry, irritably, his excitement getting the better of him.

Not for--not for--Muriel West! She murmured the name so low that she
had to repeat it.

Muriel West? No. Who on earth is Muriel West?

You dont know! she cried joyfully. But, Harry, I saw you talking to
her on a coach at Ascot.

Do you mean an actress named West? Why, Annie, how jealous you are!
I scarcely spoke to her, and shouldnt have done so at all if Stephen
hadnt been with her. A fellow I know took me to supper once at her
house a long time ago--it was the very night of my accident--and I have
never seen her since, except that day at Ascot.

Then how was it that she was wearing my ornaments? asked Annie,
quickly; and, as she spoke, the truth flashed upon them both.

The little mean scoundrel! growled Harry, clinching his fists. The
little crooked, lying rascal! He shall suffer for this clever trick.
Then he got all he could out of both of us, and kept us apart by his
lies! Of course you never said it was a disgraceful thing for me to
turn trainer?

I never knew you were a trainer until this afternoon, when I heard
those two gentlemen talking about you in the carriage as I came down.
He refused to give me your address, saying you had forbidden him to do
so, and I found it out only by this card. She took from her purse the
card she had found in the hamper, and continued, I went to see Stephen
last Friday, determined to find out where you were. I saw a hamper
of flowers with the lid open, and inside I found this card. I looked
outside, and found that the direction was to Miss Muriel West.

The direction had been changed; I directed it to you, and gave it to
that wretched little hunchback for you. And, Annie, do you mean to say
that, when you saw your ornaments on that woman, you thought that I had
given them to her? he asked, looking at her almost with horror.

What else could I think, Harry?

And you never wrote to reproach me?

I could not write about such a thing--it was too dreadful! I thought
I would accuse you of it face to face. But dont talk about it, Harry,
please--I cant bear to think of it now; it was wicked of me ever to
think it could be true.
