SCENE:
She seized the dress, and holding it up under her chin, danced away to
look at herself in the faded mirror.

Oh, momma! Let me wear it this evening, she pleaded, turning about
from side to side, preening before the glass.

You better take time to thank Mis Freeman, stead er primpin like
that, her mother admonished her. Shes the one finished it for you,
shes your friend.

Thank you, thank you, marm, the child said, turning toward Julie.
The words were constrained and inadequate, spoken in obedience to her
mothers command; but as she stood there with the pink folds of the
frock caught close to her and her pinched face flushed with happiness,
she was a little point of color and joy that lighted up the discouraged
room and made her mothers eyes linger upon her fondly a moment, then
turn for sympathetic understanding to Julie.

Look what else I got, Julie said, and took a small package from her
workbasket. The child unwrapped it shyly and a bright pink ribbon
shimmered into view.

For my hair--to match the dress, she breathed, and fell dumb with
happiness.

My, but youre kind! Mrs. Watkins exclaimed again.

Oh, it aint anything, Julie deprecated. I love to see children
in pretty clothes, an I like to sew. I used to do dressmaking up in
the country where I lived. With the words, suddenly the sight of her
little shop in Harts Run staring with blank shuttered windows out upon
the street, with its nasturtiums and sweet peas in the side yard, rose
up in her mind and hung there a moment before it dissolved. It gave
Julie a sharp stab of unexpected wistfulness.

I had a little shop once--a millinery shop, where I did sewing, too,
she confided. Somehow she felt she must speak of her home. It had come
to her as a shy child comes to its mothers knee, and she must give
it some touch of recognition. It was a shop in the front, and I had
my living rooms in behind, and a little garden on the side with sweet
peas and nasturtiums in it, she went on, offering the inner vision
propitiation.

My! That mustve been nice, the other said. Youd like that. My
Lord! Aint it hot! I wisht I was in the country right this minute.
She mopped her face with a dingy handkerchief. What was the name of
the place?

Oh, its just a little town up in the mountains, Julie evaded. You
wouldnt ever have heard of it.

Whats its name? Mrs. Watkins persisted. Maybe I have. I had a
brother used to be in the lumber business up in the western part of the
state.

Its name--its name-- Julie hesitated. She found it extraordinarily
difficult to lie, and yet to speak the truth would be utter
recklessness. All the time the little shop which had been her home
seemed to hang there in her mind expectant, waiting to see whether she
would own or deny it.

Its names Red River, she said at last, with an effort. Instantly
the picture of the shop broke and swirled away. Oh, no, it isnt! No,
it isnt! she corrected herself breathlessly, and completely reckless
now. Its Harts Run. Red Rivers the county town. But its Harts
Run--Harts Run, she cried, where my home was.

Then, terrified by what she had done, her heart began to flutter
violently up and down and she looked wildly about for some means of
changing the conversation. As she did so she caught sight through the
window of a strange old woman going down the porch steps, and passing
uncertainly out into the street.

Oh, Mrs. Watkins, Julie whispered, look quick. Who is that old
woman?

Mrs. Watkins peeped out. That? Oh, thats the poor old soul lives all
by herself up on the third floor. Shes mighty peculiar. Its Miss
Fogg.

Ive seen her several times, an meant to ask about her. Whats the
matter with her? She looks--she looks dreadful, Julie cried, glad to
elaborate the subject, and hoping that the name she had spoken would be
overlooked.

Well, shes mighty peculiar, Mrs. Watkins repeated. I reckon she
must be cracked.

But she looks so strange, so--so awful, Julie persisted.
