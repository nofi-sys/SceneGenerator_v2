SCENE:
IX.


The next day Colonel Richardson went to Scotland, after taking a very
warm farewell of Annie, who, so far as she herself was concerned, was
extremely sorry for his departure. He was the only man to whom she
had spoken since her marriage who had tastes in common with her, and
whose views of life were not bounded by the stable, the kennel, and the
dinner-table. George had indeed shown himself to be ready to enter into
her feelings, but his sympathy she was afraid to encourage. It was true
that she had felt for him, from the first time he had talked to her at
the Grange dinner-table, a warmer sentiment than she had ever felt for
Harry or any other man; and, though since her marriage she had stifled
it without much difficulty, she could not but know his interest in her
remained strong. She felt, however, that since last nights talk she
would have to be more careful as to her conduct, and combine prudence
with a little more graciousness. It did not prove so difficult, after
all.

That very afternoon she had gone into the library to amuse herself
among the old books that nobody else ever touched, but in whose very
presence she delighted; and she was perched upon the ladder that stood
there by which to reach the highest shelves, and had covered herself
with dust in her endeavors to get at the dingy-looking volume whose
only attraction lay in the fact that it was out of reach, when Sir
George came in. She was surprised to see him, as she had never seen any
of the brothers indulge in heavier reading than that which a sporting
paper afforded.

What are you doing among my books? he asked, with severity.

I dont wonder you are astonished to see any one reading them, said
she, looking down saucily, with her dull discovery open in her hand.

You think I dont know how to read, I believe.

I am sure you couldnt read this, at any rate. It is called Extracts
from the Sermons of the Reverend Thomas Dobbs, late Vicar of Garstone,
and it is dated 1844.

Why, no; I indulge in that only on very special occasions! I dont
think much of your literary taste.

And I dont think much of your library. I cant find anything better.

Oh, nonsense! Heres the Life of Knox, and the Works of Josephus,
and Foxs Martyrs. I remember my mother cured us of the vice of
reading when we were youngsters by letting us have these entertaining
works to read on Sundays. Have you ever noticed, Annie, that careless
and irreligious parents are always very particular about what their
children read on Sunday?

But I am too old to be cured in that simple manner. Find me something
nicer, please.

Come down, then, and sit by the fire, and Ill find you Clarissa
Harlowe, or something else as light and frivolous.

She came down and sat in the chair he drew on to the hearth-rug, while
he brought one book after another, and, after dusting it carefully,
placed it on her lap. Sometimes he would kneel by her side for a few
minutes to look over one with her, and listen to her remarks upon it;
and they got on so well together over this pastime that by the time the
light of the December afternoon had faded, and the red glow of the fire
was all they had to see by, the awkward barrier between them was quite
broken down, and a friendly intercourse between them begun, which was
to Annie merely a new pleasure, but which brought to the young baronet
a delight which he knew to be full of peril.

After that day she avoided him no longer, but treated him with gracious
gratitude for his kindness, which would have disarmed a man of better
principles.

Lilians coldness to her had grown into more open dislike since Colonel
Richardsons fondness for music had kept him so long at her side on
the eve of his journey to Scotland. But the girl could not do much to
make her sister-in-law uncomfortable for fear of her eldest brother,
with whom she jealously felt Annies interest to be strong. Young Sir
George was a harder and somewhat colder man than his father had been,
and took the lead in the family of which he was now the head as much by
character as by position.

It was getting very near Christmas when the baronet told his sister
one day at luncheon that he wished to speak to her. They went into the
library together, had a long interview, and, when the girl came out,
her face was red and swollen with crying. She was very silent that
evening, and Stephen watched her in wistful wretchedness. He had not
been able to speak to her that afternoon; he could only guess at the
reason for her unhappiness, and he sat brooding sullenly over Georges
cruelty in bringing tears to those proud eyes, and longing to be with
her alone, that he might learn what her trouble was and comfort her. It
was late in the evening before he got an opportunity of speaking to her
in the morning-room, whither she had gone on the pretext of fetching
some work, knowing well that her cousin would follow her. She broke
into the subject at once.
