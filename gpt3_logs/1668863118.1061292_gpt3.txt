SCENE:
XXXVII


HUGH EXPLAINS

Back of Piodie, on the other side of a high ridge, is a deep valley
hemmed in by rock-rimmed walls. Its area is about ten or fifteen acres.

The McClintocks climbed the ridge and looked down into the park. It was
filled with dead and down pion. Two years before a fire had started
there, had raged furiously for a day, and had died down before the
persistent attack of a heavy snowstorm. Since that time a new growth of
underbrush had come up.

Scot and Hugh circled the rim, studying carefully the contour of the
slopes. The upper half of these were rock-ribbed. The timber had climbed
up to these boulder outcroppings and had there given up the fight to
reach the summit, driven back by the lack of soil in which to root. Down
in the basin the dead trees had crashed and lay across each other in
confusion.

The fire never could have got out of the valley even if the snow hadnt
stopped it, Scot said.

Thats how it looks to me, Hugh agreed. The only thing that could
make it dangerous would be a high wind.

It would have to be a gale to spread the fire outside. The rocks made a
break as safe as a fireplace.

They covered every inch of the rim to make sure of this. They did not
want to take any chance of setting fire to the town. Before they left
the valley they were satisfied that a fire inside it could not do any
damage.

Budd and Byers, who knew the people of the town better than the
McClintocks did, set about gathering allies for the night campaign.
Piodie was full of lawless adventurers ready to take a hand in any
enterprise directed against the Dodsons. The difficulty was not to get
enough of them, but to select the ones with cool heads not likely to be
carried away by excitement.

As Vicky was walking home from school she met Hugh.

Tell me everything. What have you done? Did he let you see the
contract? Have you plans made yet? In her eagerness the words of her
questions tumbled over each other.

Hugh told her all he thought it was good for her to know. He trusted
implicitly her discretion, but it was possible there might be blood shed
in the attempt to win back the claims, and he did not want to make her a
party to it.

I wish I could help, she sighed. Its horrid sometimes to be a girl.
If it wasnt for my school I could go to Austin, though, and look up the
contract.

Yes, you could do that fine. But the fact is I want to get Scot away
from here. Robert Dodson hates him. I dont think hes safe on the
streets. You know how it is with gunmen. Their trigger fingers itch to
kill men with reputations for gameness. Ever since that affair at the
Ormsby House, Scot has been a shining mark. If Dodson should egg them
on

The girl looked at him with an odd smile. I suppose _youre_ safe
enough here.

Oh, yes. They wont bother me.

No, I suppose not, she answered with a touch of sarcasm. Youre only
the man that killed Sam Dutch, the one that dragged him away from his
friends to jail. Nobody would want to interfere with anybody as
inoffensive as you.

I didnt drag him away, Vicky. You did that when you stopped the rescue
at the mine and planned a way to get him out of town.

Both you and Scot are too foolhardy, she scolded. You go along with
your heads up and a scornful Well-here-I-am,
shoot-me-down-from-behind-if-you-want-to air that theres no sense in.
A man owes something to his friends and his relatives, doesnt he? No
need of always wearing a chip on your shoulder, is there?

Does Scot carry a chip on his shoulder? Hugh asked, smiling.

Oh, well, you know what I mean. He could try to dodge trouble a
littleand so could you. But youre both so stiff-necked.

I reckon Scot figures that the safest way to duck danger is to walk
right through it, he said gently. There are times when you cant run
away from it. I always run when I can. Different with Scot. _You_ blow
him up good. He needs to take better care of himself, what with Mollie
an the baby dependent on him.
