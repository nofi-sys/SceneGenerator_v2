SCENE:
It may have been the cold working upon a body worn by anxieties and
hardships: it may have been confusion in a brain nine-tenths asleep; or
it may have been another thing. As he slept, Hi became aware that Dudley
Wigmore was in the hut, sitting on a box, waiting for him to wake. He
could see him distinctly; a sad-looking man, of the middle build,
fair-haired, blue-eyed, gentle and thoughtful, yet with a clench of
resolution, in mouth and chin, which made the face memorable.

Im an ethnologist, Wigmore was saying. You want to escape from here
without fail. This is Murder Poblacion.

Is it? Hi answered. By George, did that tick murder you? Wait a
minute: Ill be awake in a minute: then, Ill ask you something. He
struggled with his sleep as he spoke, beating aside the quilt. He sat up
to see Wigmore beside him, sad-eyed, resolute, yet in some way remote
from this world. Wigmore was looking at him with a look so sad that he
could hardly bear it; he was plainly there, in a suit of old drill, real
and touchable. Yet in an instant Hi saw the thatch of the hut wall
through the mans body: the body was and then was not, like mist in a
change of wind: Dudley Wigmore was gone.

By George, Hi said. This is Murder Poblacion. I want to escape from
here. That was pretty real. By George, if that wasnt a dream, Ive seen
a ghost. I believe that that was Wigmores ghost.

He was not scared by the ghost, if it were a ghost; it had come with too
serious a warning for that. He was thrilled through with excitement; he
was pitted against a murderer in a place twenty miles from friend or
weapon.

Golly, he said. That proves it to my mind. Ive no further doubt that
that man murdered Wigmore: he did.

As he turned out of his hammock, he saw that it was almost dawn: the
young men were mustering to a hunt. One of them began to make a
melancholy noise upon a flute, to which the others answered by tapping
upon their blow-pipes. Women were already at work at the cassava presses
or at splitting away the twigs from the branches brought for firing. The
young men moved off into the forest: the young women in a group moved
off to bathe: the babies, dogs, pigeons and parrots came all to life at
once: none but the grown men remained in their hammocks, even they were
smoking.

Ill go through that pocket-book by daylight, Hi said. Perhaps I
shall be able to make out rather more of it, when I have the light. He
put his hand to the shelf for the book, and found it gone: it had not
fallen to the floor nor into his hammock: it was gone.

I say, Hi thought. That fellow must have been watching me last night,
to some purpose. That was why he crept to the door, that first time.
When I was asleep, he must have crept in again and bagged it from where
I put it. All right. Its just as well to know that he is roused. I am
roused, too. But, by Jove, hell never let me get to Anselmo, now that
it has come to this.

He was standing, thinking these thoughts, with a daunted heart, near the
door of his hut, when a sentence floated into his mind as clearly as
though a voice had spoken in his ear. He will never let you get to
Anselmo, the sentence came. Look out for him.

It came with the distinctness of personality from the depths of his
being to voice the thought matured there. It is true, he repeated, he
will never let me go. I must look out for him. But what am I to do?

He had no time to think of what he was to do, because at that moment
Letcombe-Bassett appeared: he seemed to be in a much better temper than
hitherto.

So youre up, he said. Good. Theres nothing like the bally dawn in
these bally tropics: one soon gets into forest habits here: they are the
only ways that keep one alive here. As soon as Chug-chug brings our
chow, well pasea.

Its jolly good of you, Hi said, to see me off upon my road.

Not a bit, the man answered. Out here, an Englishman with another
Englishman, that is the least one could do.

Hi thought that to see a man off the premises is perhaps the least that
one can do: he also thought that the mans mood had strangely changed
for the better since the night before. Then he had been savage at the
thought of showing the way: now he was eager to show it. It occurred to
him that there might be a reason for this change, and that this reason,
coming from an unpleasant nature, might be an unpleasant one.

I suppose I might reach the road before to-night? Hi said.

Reach what road?

The road to Santa Barbara?
