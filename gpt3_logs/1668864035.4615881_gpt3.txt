Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Then, Blair seemed not to be able to keep off the question of the races
again, although no mention was made of the especial match between
them. Elizabeth listened with an aching heart. What a trifle it was to
Skelton, while to them it was the most tremendous event in the world.
It might mean the turning of herself and Blair and her children out
of house and home. But she gave no sign of this inward fear, speaking
lightly, although she had a horrible feeling that Skelton knew how
hollow their pretence was--that the money Blair had risked might
have to be got by some occult means, for not another penny could be
raised upon Newington. Presently Skelton rose and said good-by, Blair
seeing him to the door and watching him as he stepped lightly into his
curricle. Then Blair came back like a criminal to his wife.

But Elizabeth had no reproaches to make. She was fluent enough when her
feelings were not deeply touched, but under the influence of profound
emotion she became perfectly silent. She was inapt at reproaches too;
but Blair would cheerfully have preferred even the extraordinary
wiggings that Mrs. Shapleigh gave her husband to the still and
heart-breaking reproof of Elizabeths despairing, wordless look. He
walked about the room for a few moments, while Elizabeth, with her work
dropping from her listless hand, sat in fixed sadness.

By Jupiter, the horse _must_ win! he cried excitedly, after a moment.
For Gods sake, Elizabeth, dont look at me in that way!

Elizabeth made a desperate effort to rally.

How can I accuse you, she said, when I, too, am a coward before
Richard Skelton? I ought to say: We are desperately poor and in
debt--we cant afford to risk anything, no matter how promising the
chances are, because we have nothing to risk. We are living now upon
our creditors. Instead of that, I sit by and smile and say I have no
fear, and profess to be willing. I am the greatest coward in the world.
One word, just now, and the whole thing would have been off--but I did
not say it. No, I am as much to blame in this as you are.

Skelton, driving home, concluded he would stop at Belfield. He was
inwardly raging, as he always was at any slight upon Lewis Pryor. There
was he, Mr. Skelton, of Deerchase, supposed to be the richest and most
powerful man in the county, and yet he could not get a single family
to recognise that boy--except at Belfield. Just as he was turning this
over bitterly in his mind, he drove up to the door of the Belfield
house. It was yet in the bright forenoon.

Both Mr. and Mrs. Shapleigh were at home. Skelton only stayed a few
minutes, when, glancing out of the window, he saw Sylvia and Lewis
Pryor sitting together in the little summerhouse on the bridge across
the creek that separated the two plantations. Skelton rose.

I see Miss Shapleigh on the bridge, and if you will excuse me I will
say good-day to you and join her.

Old Tom was excessively surprised.

Why, said he, you are paying us a monstrous short visit! I thought
you had come especially to see me.

Not at all, said Skelton, I called to pay my respects to the
ladies, and, with a bow, he walked out, and they saw him cross the
lawn and follow the bridge to the summerhouse.

There, now, Mr. Shapleigh! exclaimed Mrs. Shapleigh triumphantly,
wasnt I a long-headed woman, to have that summerhouse built eighteen
years ago for Richard Skelton and Sylvia to make love in?

Its the first time theyve ever been in it since it was built, maam.

Well, everything has to have a beginning, Mr. Shapleigh, though, of
course, I know he never can marry my poor, beautiful girl.

Yes, he can, Mrs. Shapleigh. If he chooses to pay several hundred
thousand dollars for her, he can.

Mr. Shapleigh, you talk very foolishly. What man alive, do you think,
would pay that much to marry any woman? Though I will say, if any woman
is worth it, Sylvia is the one, and shes not half as good-looking as I
was at her age, either.

True, madam. But if one had half a million dollars to buy a wife with,
he might have a good, long hunt before he found a woman like you, my
own love.

Now, Mr. Shapleigh, are you joking?

I cant hear you, my sweet, responded Mr. Shapleigh cheerfully.
Every day I seem to get deafer and deafer, particularly to your voice.

I notice you can hear some things well enough. When I say, Mr.
Shapleigh, weve got wild ducks for dinner to-day, you can hear as
well as I can. And when I say, Mr. Shapleigh, the moths have made
ravages in the carpets, you always think Im talking about cabbages in
the garden, or something a thousand miles off. You ought to be treated
for your deafness and have it cured.
