SCENE:
He had not thought of women; until that moment he had never bothered his
head about them. He had considered them as a race apart, with ways of
their own which, on the whole, he resented. From time to time he had met
a girl who had been a jolly good sport: Rosa was rather a good sport;
anyhow, they were the exceptions. The rest were in a world of their own,
with nerves and standards of their own which he disliked but respected.
Now suddenly there stood before him a woman who realised all his dreams
of what a woman should be. Yet she was not like any other woman. She was
as little like a woman as a humming bird is like a bird. She was a
small, perfect, spiritual shape, glowing like a humming bird. He had
once heard somebody say that you only get perfection in small things;
he had thought the man an ass at the time, but remembered it now. This
woman was perfect. Her hair was of a most deep, dark brown, very
abundant, but caught close to her head by a narrow fillet of gold. This
gave her something the look of a boy, enough, perhaps, to establish a
sympathy with a boy like Hi. The eyes were darker than the hair. They
shone as though the brain behind them were one glow of light. They were
not only kind, good eyes, but so very merry. The eyebrows were
remarkable. As in most clever faces, the base of her nose, at the brow,
was broad, and the space between the eyes not small. The unusual beauty
of the eyebrows was their length; they continued the demarcation of the
brow to the right and left; they were straight in line over the eyes,
and lifted a little at the right and left sides, in a way impossible to
describe, though it made the face most vivid and unusual. The nose was
straight. The ears, which are seldom beautiful, even in the beautiful,
were perfect in her. The cheeks were of a rich colour as though the life
within were very intense. The mouth was the great distinction: it was of
a faultless beauty. All fun, all thoughtfulness, all generosity, were in
those gentle, sensitive, proud curves. She wore white, with a green
jacket. Her voice seemed to Hi to be the quality of voice he had always
most longed to hear. She spoke English faultlessly.

So Rosa has put you to cutting out Easter dresses? she asked.

Women are always making men slaves, he said.

Well, after lunch, you shall be free. Manuel will be here to lunch,
Rosa, so if its cool enough we might play tennis afterwards. Would you
play, Mr. Ridden?

Id love some tennis.

She picked up some pattern-paper, turned it, folded it, snipped it with
scissors, refolded it, snipped it again, and then shook it out as a sort
of cape or shawl of lace.

That is what the negresses wear in San Jacinto, she said. They cut
the linen and wear it over scarlet; it looks just like lace at a little
distance.

You are clever, Hi said, to cut it all out like that. I wish youd
show me how you did it.

Like this, she said, picking up another piece of paper.

The English are always wanting to do things, Rosa said. They never
say, Heres a perfect day, lets think about perfection. They say,
Here, its stopped raining, lets do something.

You did your share when you were in England, he said, so you neednt
talk.

She seems to have been busy this morning, Carlotta said. Well talk
about perfection, if you like.

I dont want to talk, but to listen, Rosa said. Suppose you sing.

Carlotta went to the piano and sang a couple of Spanish songs, one
strange, the other grim, both haunting. Hi thought them the most
beautiful things he had ever heard, sung by the most marvellous voice.
He could not turn his eyes from her face and throat. She was the most
exquisite thing he had ever seen. He felt himself to be vile and a boor,
and unfit to walk the same planet. He wondered whether he could possibly
take the pattern-papers which she had cut, or the scissors she had used.
He stared and stared. He knew it to be rude, but could not help it. My
God, she is beautiful, he thought. She is lovely, lovely. O God, I
wish I could fight for her or do something for her.

He noticed her hands. They were not the thin, pale, very knuckly bundles
of skewers which ladies hands usually seemed to him, but perfections of
form and marks of capacities. There was a ring on one finger. There it
is, he thought; shes engaged to be married, to this devil Manuel, who
isnt good enough for her. This devil Manuel can kiss her. Id like to
call him out. Glancing suddenly away from the lovely face he saw Rosa
watching him with a certain malice tinged just a little, unselfish as
she was, with envy. No one had stared at her in quite that way before
she had taken any pains to secure it.

Rosa smiled somewhat bitterly; a gong was beaten to call them to lunch.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is very descriptive, with long, detailed sentences about Carlotta's appearance. The point of view is from Hi's perspective, and the tone is one of awe and admiration.
