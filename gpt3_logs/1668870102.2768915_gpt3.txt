SCENE:
Miss Katy-did sat on the branch of a flowering Azalia, in her best suit
of fine green and silver, with wings of point-lace from Mother Natures
finest web.

Miss Katy was in the very highest possible spirits, because her gallant
cousin, Colonel Katy-did, had looked in to make her a morning visit. It
was a fine morning, too, which goes for as much among the Katy-dids as
among men and women. It was, in fact, a morning that Miss Katy thought
must have been made on purpose for her to enjoy herself in. There had
been a patter of rain the night before, which had kept the leaves awake
talking to each other till nearly morning, but by dawn the small winds
had blown brisk little puffs, and whisked the heavens clear and bright
with their tiny wings, as you have seen Susan clear away the cobwebs in
your mammas parlor; and so now there were only left a thousand blinking,
burning water-drops, hanging like convex mirrors at the end of each leaf,
and Miss Katy admired herself in each one.

Certainly I am a pretty creature, she said to herself; and when the
gallant Colonel said something about being dazzled by her beauty, she
only tossed her head and took it as quite a matter of course.

The fact is, my dear Colonel, she said, I am thinking of giving a
party, and you must help me make out the lists.

My dear, you make me the happiest of Katy-dids.

Now, said Miss Katy-did, drawing an azalia-leaf towards her, let us
see,whom shall we have? The Fireflies, of course; everybody wants them,
they are so brilliant;a little unsteady, to be sure, but quite in the
higher circles.

Yes, we must have the Fireflies, echoed the Colonel.

Well, then,and the Butterflies and the Moths. Now, theres a trouble.
Theres such an everlasting tribe of those Moths; and if you invite dull
people theyre always sure all to come, every one of them. Still, if you
have the Butterflies, you cant leave out the Moths.

Old Mrs. Moth has been laid up lately with a gastric fever, and that may
keep two or three of the Misses Moth at home, said the Colonel.

Whatever could give the old lady such a turn? said Miss Katy. I
thought she never was sick.

I suspect its high living. I understand she and her family ate up a
whole ermine cape last month, and it disagreed with them.

For my part, I cant conceive how the Moths can live as they do, said
Miss Katy, with a face of disgust. Why, I could no more eat worsted and
fur, as they do

That is quite evident from the fairy-like delicacy of your appearance,
said the Colonel. One can see that nothing so gross or material has ever
entered into your system.

Im sure, said Miss Katy, mamma says she dont know what does keep me
alive; half a dewdrop and a little bit of the nicest part of a rose-leaf,
I assure you, often last me for a day. But we are forgetting our list.
Lets see,the Fireflies, Butterflies, Moths. The Bees must come, I
suppose.

The Bees are a worthy family, said the Colonel.

Worthy enough, but dreadfully humdrum, said Miss Katy. They never talk
about anything but honey and housekeeping; still, they are a class of
people one cannot neglect.

Well, then, there are the Bumble-Bees.

O, I doat on them! General Bumble is one of the most dashing, brilliant
fellows of the day.

I think he is shockingly corpulent, said Colonel Katy-did, not at all
pleased to hear him praised;dont you?

I dont know but he _is_ a little stout, said Miss Katy; but so
distinguished and elegant in his manners,something martial and breezy
about him.

Well, if you invite the Bumble-Bees you must have the Hornets.

Those spiteful Hornets,I detest them!

Nevertheless, dear Miss Katy, one does not like to offend the Hornets.

No, one cant. There are those five Misses Hornet,dreadful old
maids!as full of spite as they can live. You may be sure they will every
one come, and be looking about to make spiteful remarks. Put down the
Hornets, though.
