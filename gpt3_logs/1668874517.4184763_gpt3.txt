SCENE:
In front of the wardens house a convict was wheeling manure and
scattering it on the lawn. Some trick of gesture caught the attention of
Ruth. Her arrested eyes fixed themselves on the man. His shoulders
drooped, and his whole attitude expressed dejected listlessness, but she
was sure she knew him. Deserting the wardens wife, she ran forward with
both hands outstretched.

Oh, Im so glad to see you!

For an instant a puzzled expression lifted the white eyebrows and
slackened the lank jaw of Sam Yerby. Then his shoulders straightened. He
had been caught with his guard down, detected in the mood of
hopelessness into which he often fell now.

He came gamely to time. Wellwell, Miss Ruth. Im sure proud to see
you, maam.

They told me you were at a road camp. One of the guards said so.

I was, but Im back. Youre looking fine, maam. Missie writes me
you-all done got a little baby of yore own now.

She nodded. Yes, Ill tell you all about it. But how are you? Missie
will ask me a hundred questions.

Im tolable, thank you. Yerby, looking across her shoulder, saw a
guard moving toward them. He did not mention to her that he was liable
to ten days solitary confinement for talking to a visitor without
permission. Hows Missieand Son?

Missie is prettier than ever. Shes always talking about you. And the
boyhes the dandiest little chapsmart as a whip and good as gold.
Youll be awfully pleased with him when you come home.

Yesmwhen I come home.

His voice fell flat. Its lifelessness went to the heart of his friend.
She saw that hope was dead within him. He was getting into the fifties,
and the years were slipping away.

That wont be long. Were getting up a petition to

The guard pushed between Ruth and the convict. You know the rule,
Yerby, he said curtly.

Yes, sir, and I most generally aim to keep it. But when a lady speaks
to mean old friend

Come along with me.

The old cowman dropped his shovel and shambled off beside the guard.

Ruth turned in consternation to the wife of the warden. What have I
done?

He oughtnt to have talked with you. Thats the rule. He knew it.

You wont let him be punished because I made a mistake, will you? Hes
a Texan, you know. He thinks it wouldnt be courteous not to answer a
lady. It would make me very unhappy if I had got him into trouble.

The wardens wife smiled. I think it can be arranged this time. We all
like him. Were all sorry for him. He takes it to heart a good deal that
he has to stay in prison. I talk with him when he pots my plants, and he
tells me he wants to hear the whining of a rope and to taste the dust of
the drag driver, whatever that is. I wish the governor would pardon him.
If he stays much longer hell become an old man with no hope in his
heart.

Ill tell his wife that you are good to him. It will be a great comfort
to her. Shes a good deal younger than he is, but shes very fond of
him.

The meeting with Yerby depressed Ruth more even than her encounter with
Falkner. She took home with her a memory of a brave man slowly having
the zest of life pressed out of him.

But of this she said little when next she wrote to Rowan. Always her
letters had running through them the red thread of hope. She told him
that Flanders was getting up a petition for a parole which had been
signed by half the county, including the judge who had tried him, every
member of the jury, the prosecuting attorney, and the sheriff. Nor did
she mention that Ruth McCoy was the motive power behind the petition,
that she in person had won the signatures of Haight, Matson, and the
judge, as well as hundreds of others.

The clock struck midnight before she finished her letter:

It is very late, sweetheartalmost utterly quiet, save for a
small wind among the leaves, and the night is black and soft,
and abloom with stars. Stillness and stars and whispering
windthey are all astir with dreams and questionsyes, and
answers, too. I feel sure of that, loveas sure as I do of you.
