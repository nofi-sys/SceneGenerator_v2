SCENE:
XI

_Oh! There was a social party,
Of Repubs and Democrats;
Met at Michael Caseys,
And put away their hats,
One ticket gave a lady,
Admittance and her grub,
Invited by the committee,
Of the Casey Social Club._

POPULAR SONG.


THE entrance to the hall was a-glitter with gas lights; freshly
barbered young men in high collars and sack coats stood about the
doorway, smoking cigarettes and spitting on the steps. A wagon was
unloading kegs of beer at a side door; people flocked into the smoky
entry; now and then a hired hack would pull up at the curb and a member
of the club would hand his sweetheart out and up the steps. Four
policemen, engaged at three dollars a head to keep order, stood on the
sidewalk counting the ingoing kegs.

Forty quarters, all told, said a pock-marked officer, lifting his
huge shoulders.

Whew! The clubll have a neat wad to put away if they sell all that!
An just look at the people goin in!

Say, theres one fight in every two kegs o beer, said a third
policeman. That makes twenty turns before the janitor turns off the
lights. We aint a-goin to have no cinch.

The others laughed.

At the far end of the entry stood a pair of half doors so arranged that
only one person could pass them at a time. Behind these, bathed in a
glare of yellow light from a cluster of gas jets which hung directly
overhead, stood Danny Casey, attired in a dress suit rented from
Goldstine the costumer, a huge crimson badge edged with gold braid
hanging from his lapel. He was taking tickets and deftly slipping
them into a slot in a tin box which stood beside him on a chair; on
the stairs leading to the ballroom, a man with a mass of brass checks
hanging by strings from his fingers was keeping up a continuous fire
of patter. Murphy and McGonagle, feeling rather queer behind their
glittering expanses of shirt front, walked stiffly down the steps to
where Casey was standing.

A mob! said McGonagle. The floors blocked with em already.

And theyve ony started to come, said Casey. Who ordered the extree
beer?

McGlory: an well need it, too; for the guys whats a-comin in looks
dead tirsty.

Say, put in Murphy, in an injured tone, I dont know how youse
people take it but I feel like a sign for a clothin store. I cant
bend witout breakin me shirt and the pants aint got no pockets in.

You look, commented McGonagle, like a dressed up prize-fighter.
Somebody ought to slam McGlory in the jaw for makin that motion that
we all must wear dress suits. I know I look a mess in mine.

Thirty-eight dress suits at a dollar a throw, figured Casey, as he
politely plucked ticket after ticket from hands extending them to him;
thats thirty-eight plunks. Goldstines makin money and McGlory will
be holdin him up for a comish.

There was a stir among the sack-coated and high-collared coterie at
the entrance. A tall, well-built girl, tastefully dressed and carrying
herself with a dashing air, had come in, escorted by a blushing youth
who looked very uncomfortable under the notice they created.

Its Nelly Fogarty, said someone. She dont look like a poverty
knocker when shes dressed up, eh?

Oh Nelly was a lady, sang another. Say, Brennen, heres yer girl!

Gee! exclaimed the person addressed. And I told her I wasnt comin;
shes got me dead!

The congregated youths grinned over their high collars and bowed after
the fashion approved by Professor Whalen, teacher of the Glide Waltz.
The girl flashed them a smile as she went by, a bunch of La France
roses in her hand. But a cloud crossed her face, and she bit her lips
at sight of young Brennen.

Go on, please, Mr. Shimph, requested she, of her escort. Ill folly
you in a minute.
