SCENE:
VI.
CONCLUSION.


We reached our destination on an evening in December. The ground was
covered with snow, and the sun was setting in superbly shaded violet
clouds, but with an air of melancholy. I did not wish to interfere with
the first effusions of two lovers hearts, and so ordered Bernard to
precede me to the chteau. Besides, I needed the sole companionship of
my thoughts for the first few moments. It was not without a great
emotion that I again beheld the spot where I had lived centuries in the
space of three days.

I threw Baptiste the reins of my horse, and he proceeded towards the
stables, while I went in alone through one of the small doors of the
park.

This beautiful spot, stripped of its flowers and verdure, had now a
grander character. From the sombre pines, frosty showers fell upon my
head, and the branches of the old lindens, clad in ice formed delicate
arcades of crystal, above the arbor of the alleys. One might have
thought them the naves of a gigantic cathedral offering all the caprices
of an unknown and fantastic architecture. But I again found Spring in
the rotunda of the library. They had separated it from the contiguous
galleries by fitting the arches with glass windows, so as to make a sort
of temperate hothouse. The waters of the fountain still murmured amid
exotics that were even more beautiful than those I had seen before, and
this flowing water, whilst without all sources slept enchained in ice,
delighted alike the eye and ear.

It was with some difficulty that I decided to look at the Naiad. I found
her less beautiful than the memory left me of her whose form and
features she recalled. Then, gradually, I began to admire and love it,
as one cherishes a portrait which in general appearance and in some of
the features at least, resembles a beloved one. My feelings had been
contained and over excited for so long a time that I burst into tears
and, overwhelmed with emotion, remained seated on the spot where I had
beheld one whom I no longer hoped to see.

The sound of a silken robe caused me to raise my head, and I saw before
me a very tall and slender woman, but of most graceful mien, who
regarded me anxiously. For an instant I confounded her with my vision,
but the darkness which was rapidly advancing prevented me from clearly
distinguishing her face, and besides a woman in panniers and furbelows
so little resembles a nymph of the renaissance, that my illusions were
quickly dispelled, and I arose to salute her simply as a mortal.

She also bowed, hesitated for an instant to address me, then decided to
do so, and I trembled at the sound of her voice which penetrated to the
very core of my being. Twas the silvery voice, the voice without its
equal upon earth, of the divinity. And I was dumb and incapable of
replying. As when in the presence of my immortal nymph, I was too
bewildered to understand what she was saying.

She seemed greatly embarrassed by my silence, and I made an effort to
shake off this absurd stupor. She asked me if I were not M. Just
Nivires.

Yes, madame, I at last answered. I beg of you to pardon my
preoccupation. I was a little indisposed, I was dozing.

No, replied she with adorable sweetness, you were weeping! That was
what drew me here from the gallery where I was awaiting the signal of my
brothers arrival.

Your brother?

Yes, your friend, Bernard dAillane.

So you are Mademoiselle dAillane?

Flicie dAillane, and I dare affirm your friend also, although you do
not know me and I am seeing you for the first time. But the high opinion
my brother has of you and all that he has written about you have caused
me to feel a sincere interest in you. So it was with real sorrow and
anxiety that I heard you sobbing. _Mon dieu!_ I hope that you are not
grieving over any family affliction; if your worthy parents of whom I
have also heard so much good, were in trouble, you would not be here.

Thank God, I replied, I have no cause to distress myself about any of
those dear to me, and the personal grief that I experienced just now was
dispelled by the sound of your voice, by the sweet words you have
spoken. But how does it happen that having such a sister as you, Bernard
should never have mentioned it?

Bernard is absorbed by an affection of which I am not in the least
jealous, and that I very well understand, for madame is a tender sister
to me. But did you not come with him, and how is it that I find you here
alone and unannounced?


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with the protagonist, M. Just Nivires, returning to the chateau where he had previously spent a few days. He is accompanied by Bernard, but Nivires orders him to go ahead to the chateau while he takes a moment to reflect on the emotions he is feeling.
Nivires then enters the chateau and is immediately struck by the change in atmosphere from when he was last there. The ground is covered in snow and the sun is setting, creating a melancholy mood. Nivires remembers the chateau from when it was full of flowers and verdure and is now struck by its grandeur.
As he walks through the chateau, he comes across the rotunda of the library which has been turned into a sort of hothouse. The fountain is still flowing and the exotic plants are even more beautiful than before. Nivires is then drawn to the statue of the Naiad, which he finds less beautiful than the memory he has of the woman it resembles. However, he gradually begins to appreciate the statue and starts to cry, overwhelmed with emotion.
The sound of a silken robe causes Nivires to look up and he sees a tall, slender woman before him. He is momentarily confused, thinking she is the woman from his vision, but he quickly realizes she is not. The woman introduces herself as Flicie d'Aillane, Bernard's sister.
Flicie is surprised to find Nivires crying and asks if he is okay. Nivires explains that he was just overwhelmed with emotion at being back in the chateau. Flicie then tells him that Bernard is on his way and will be arriving soon.
The scene ends with Nivires and Flicie chatting and getting to know each other better. Nivires is surprised that Bernard never mentioned his sister and Flicie is equally surprised that Nivires is here alone.
