SCENE:
The youngster went home to bed and to sleep. Meanwhile Dutch, to restore
his weakened self-esteem and courage, drank heavily through the night.

In the morning Hugh made his few preparations. He wrote a letter to his
father and another to Scot. He ate a good breakfast. He examined
carefully his revolver and a sawed-off shotgun loaded with slugs.

By way of back alleys he reached the Glory Hole and slipped through the
back entrance to a small table in the darkest corner of the saloon.
Except for the bartender Hugh was almost alone in the place. Two men,
their feet on the rail, were discussing the bonanza in Last Chance Hill.
They were comparing the merits of the Real Del Monte and the Wide West,
both of which mines were producing very rich ore. Occasionally somebody
else drifted in and out again.

The bartender looked curiously at the young fellow with the sawed-off
shotgun on the table in front of him. He was a little puzzled to know
what to do. He did not want to intrude in anybodys private affairs, but
he did not want any trouble in the Glory Hole. Perhaps this youngster
was going hunting and had agreed to meet someone here.

The attendant drifted that way on pretense of wiping a table with a
towel.

Serve you anything? he asked casually.

No, thanks.

Waitin for someone?

Yes.

Can I take care of the gun till yore friend gets here?

Thanks. Its no trouble.

Live here?

Yes. Wood contract for the Real Del Monte.

The young strangers manner was so matter of fact that the bartenders
suspicions, not very strong, were lulled to rest. It was not likely,
anyhow, that this boy with the golden down on his cheeks could be
looking for trouble.

There came an irruption of patrons and the man with the apron became
busy. Then another group swept into the place. There were five of them.
In the van was Dutch. Hugh recognized Buckley, Daily, and Three-Fingered
Jack. They took noisily a table close to the one where Hugh sat.

Daily, about to sit down, gripped the back of his chair hard and stared
at the man behind the sawed-off shotgun. He did not take his seat.
Instead, out of one corner of his mouth, he dropped a word of warning to
Dutch. Then, as though moved by a careless impulse to speak to the
bartender, he sauntered to the front of the room.

Dutch slewed round his head and looked at Hugh. Neither of them spoke a
word. The killer was not drunk. He was in that depressed state of mind
which follows heavy drinking after the stimulus has died down. One
glance was enough to make clear to him his carelessness. By the crook of
a finger his foe could fill him full of buckshot.

The ticking of a clock behind the bar was the only sound in the room.
The gun-fighters with Dutch dared not rise to slip out of the line of
fire for fear McClintock might misunderstand the movement and blaze
away.

Hugh broke the silence. If any of you gentlemen have business elsewhere
Mr. Dutch and I will excuse you.

All of them, it appeared, had matters needing their attention. They
moved swiftly and without delay.

Dutch begged for his life. His ugly face was a yellowish-green from
fear. I was jes a-foolin, young fellow. I didnt aim to hurt you
none. Only a lil joke. Ole Sam dont bear no grudge. Les be friends.

The man with the shotgun said nothing. With the tip of his forefinger he
tapped slowly three times on the wooden top of the table.

The bad man gave a low moan of terror. He had no thought but that he had
come to the end of the passage. His brain was too paralyzed to permit
him to try to draw his revolver. Nemesis was facing him.

Hands on the table, ordered Hugh.

The big hands trembled up and fell there. Abjectly Dutch pleaded for the
mercy he had never given another man. He would leave camp. He would go
to Mexico. He would quit carrying a gun. Any terms demanded he would
meet.
