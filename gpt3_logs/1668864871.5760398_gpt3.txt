SCENE:
Disbelief hardened Carlin's voice. "You haven't. Nobody ever has. There
just isn't any way--suck out gases from any point on the Sun and you
lower pressure at that point, and lowered pressure automatically starts
a whirl."

"Carlin, I _have_ found such a way! I tell you, with it we can suck
unlimited copper from the Sun without creating one tiny Sun-spot!"

Laird Carlin stared. "You're telling me that, because you know I'm
going to report your plans to Control Operations."

"You wouldn't do that!" cried Marn, incredulously.

Carlin nodded firmly. "I don't want to but I've got to. I can't let a
bunch of crazy men bring on a disaster that might scorch life itself
off your inner planets."

Jonny Land's thin face flared irritable emotion as he limped forward
unheeding of the gun in Carlin's hand.

"Carlin, man, be reasonable! Why do you suppose I had you come here and
live with us? It was because you're a CE and I'll need another trained
engineer's help in operating this thing. And do you suppose I ever
thought I could get your help unless I could convince you I've found
the way to safe Sun-mining? I can convince you, Carlin!"

Carlin felt the conviction in Jonny's voice. What the crippled young
man said did logically explain something otherwise puzzling--why they
had taken him into their home when their work was so secret.

He remembered now that it was not until Jonny Land had learned he was
a CE, on his first arrival on Earth, that the young Earthman had shown
interest and offered him lodgings.

"All I ask," Jonny was saying earnestly, "is that you give me a chance
to explain our plans to you. I know I can convince you that we can mine
the Sun without the slightest danger of disaster."

"If that's so," Carlin demanded skeptically, "why didn't you convince
the Control Council of that, and get permission for Sun-mining instead
of trying to do all this in secret?"

"Carlin, I did try to convince the Council," Jonny Land declared. "I
made one petition to them after another, giving them full details of
my plan. But Council isn't composed of engineers. And the popular
prejudice against Sun-mining, due to those past disasters, is so strong
that Council refused us permission to make the attempt."

"That's why Ross Floring and the others down at Control Operations
watch my brothers so closely, Laird," Marn added quickly. "They know
about our petitions, and Floring suspects that Jonny is going to try
this thing anyway."

It all fitted together logically, Carlin had to admit. Yet he still
stood irresolute, the atom-gun in his hand.

"Here's a proposition, Carlin," said Jonny. "I'll explain every detail
of our plan to you in the morning. If you don't admit then that the
plan's completely without danger of disaster, I'll let you go and tell
everything to Floring. I give you my word on it."

Carlin looked at him doubtfully. "Jonny, you'd break your word as
cheerfully as your neck to carry out your purpose for Earth."

Jonny Land grinned crookedly. "That's true. But on the other hand,
I'm still hoping for your help in this project. That's why I want to
convince you, and that's the best guarantee I can give you."

Carlin shrugged, but he slowly lowered the weapon.

"I can tell you right now that I'll have no part in any such illegal
venture," he said flatly. "But I'm willing to hear your explanation."

"Well," Jonny said, with a tired sigh, "we've had enough dramatics
for one evening. Harb, lock up the workshop and we'll all turn in for
tonight."

Carlin looked a little awkwardly at Marn as he handed her back the
atom-pistol.

"I'm sorry if I appear ungrateful for your hospitality," he told her.
"It's just that I can't stand by and do nothing if a crazy attempt
threatens to bring on catastrophe."

"I know," Marn said soberly, and there was no hostility in her face.
"But you'll find out that Jonny knows what he's doing."

Out of the darkness behind them spoke a shrill voice that made Laird
Carlin swing around in astonishment.
