Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
When Gray Cock came home, he found that Master Freddy had been before
him, and established Mrs. Feathertop upon eight nice eggs, where she
was sitting in gloomy grandeur. He tried to make a little affable
conversation with her, and to relate his interview with the doctor and
Goody Kertarkut, but she was morose and sullen, and only pecked at him
now and then in a very sharp, unpleasant way; so after a few more efforts
to make himself agreeable, he left her, and went out promenading with the
captivating Mrs. Red Comb, a charming young Spanish widow, who had just
been imported into the neighboring yard.

Bless my soul! said he, youve no idea how cross my wife is.

O you horrid creature! said Mrs. Red Comb; how little you feel for the
weaknesses of us poor hens!

On my word, maam, said Gray Cock, you do me injustice. But when a
hen gives way to temper, maam, and no longer meets her husband with a
smile,when she even pecks at him whom she is bound to honor and obey

Horrid monster! talking of obedience! I should say, sir, you came
straight from Turkey! and Mrs. Red Comb tossed her head with a most
bewitching air, and pretended to run away, and old Mrs. Scratchard looked
out of her coop and called to Goody Kertarkut,

Look how Mr. Gray Cock is flirting with that widow. I always knew she
was a baggage.

And his poor wife left at home alone, said Goody Kertarkut. Its the
way with em all!

Yes, yes, said Dame Scratchard, shell know what real life is now,
and she wont go about holding her head so high, and looking down on her
practical neighbors that have raised families.

Poor thing, whatll she do with a family? said Goody Kertarkut.

Well, what business have such young flirts to get married? said Dame
Scratchard. I dont expect shell raise a single chick; and theres Gray
Cock flirting about, fine as ever. Folks didnt do so when I was young.
Im sure my husband knew what treatment a setting hen ought to have,poor
old Long Spur,he never minded a peck or so now and then. I must say
these modern fowls ant what fowls used to be.

Meanwhile the sun rose and set, and Master Fred was almost the only
friend and associate of poor little Mrs. Feathertop, whom he fed daily
with meal and water, and only interrupted her sad reflections by pulling
her up occasionally to see how the eggs were coming on.

At last, Peep, peep, peep! began to be heard in the nest, and one
little downy head after another poked forth from under the feathers,
surveying the world with round, bright, winking eyes; and gradually the
brood were hatched, and Mrs. Feathertop arose, a proud and happy mother,
with all the bustling, scratching, care-taking instincts of family-life
warm within her breast. She clucked and scratched, and cuddled the little
downy bits of things as handily and discreetly as a seven-year-old hen
could have done, exciting thereby the wonder of the community.

Master Gray Cock came home in high spirits, and complimented her; told
her she was looking charmingly once more, and said, Very well, very
nice! as he surveyed the young brood. So that Mrs. Feathertop began
to feel the world going well with her,when suddenly in came Dame
Scratchard and Goody Kertarkut to make a morning call.

Lets see the chicks, said Dame Scratchard.

Goodness me, said Goody Kertarkut, what a likeness to their dear papa!

Well, but bless me, whats the matter with their bills? said Dame
Scratchard. Why, my dear, these chicks are deformed! Im sorry for you,
my dear, but its all the result of your inexperience; you ought to have
eaten pebble-stones with your meal when you were setting. Dont you see,
Dame Kertarkut, what bills they have? Thatll increase, and theyll be
frightful!

What shall I do? said Mrs. Feathertop, now greatly alarmed.

Nothing, as I know of, said Dame Scratchard, since you didnt come to
me before you set. I could have told you all about it. Maybe it wont
kill em, but theyll always be deformed.

And so the gossips departed, leaving a sting under the pin-feathers of
the poor little hen mamma, who began to see that her darlings had curious
little spoon-bills, different from her own, and to worry and fret about
it.

My dear, she said to her spouse, do get Dr. Peppercorn to come in and
look at their bills, and see if anything can be done.

Dr. Peppercorn came in, and put on a monstrous pair of spectacles, and
said, Hum! Ha! Extraordinary case,very singular!
