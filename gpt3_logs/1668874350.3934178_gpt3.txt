SCENE:
XXI


A COMPROMISE

MURDER in the first-degree.

Not a muscle of the prisoners face moved as the clerk of the court read
the verdict. He gave no sign whatever of emotion. Since Silcotts
testimony he had expected nothing less. Now his grave eyes rested on the
face of the clerk with steady composure.

The reporters, watching him for copy, would have been disappointed if
they had had to depend upon him for it. But into the dead silence of the
courtroom was lifted the low, sobbing wail of a woman. Ruth had
collapsed into the ample bosom of Mrs. Flanders.

The face of the convicted man twitched, but he did not look around.
Without the evidence of his eyes he knew who had broken down under the
strain, whose game will had weakened at the blow. In that moment he
thought wholly of her, not at all of himself.

A grizzled old cattleman pushed his broad shoulders through the crowd
toward the condemned raider. This aint the end, boy. Well work like
sixty to get you a new trial. This will never go throughnever in the
world! His strong arm fell with frank affection across the shoulders of
his friend. It dont matter what names they call you, son. Youre the
same old Mac to all of us.

This is when a fellow finds out who his friends are, Roswell, answered
Rowan simply.

He had many of them. They rallied to him by scoreslong, loose-jointed,
capable men with leathery brown faces, men who had fought with him
against Wyoming blizzards for the lives of driven cattle, men who had
slept beside him under the same tarp by many a campfire. From Rawlins
and Casper and Cheyenne, and even far-away Denver, came words of good
cheer. They stressed the point that the fight for his life was just
beginning and that the verdict of the jury would not be accepted as
final.

A telegram from Pendleton, Oregon, touched him deeply. It was signed by
four bronco busters whom he had beaten for the championship at Bad Ax:

Stick to the saddle, Mac. Dont you pull leather, old scout.
Were here hollering our heads off for the best rider that ever
slapped a saddle on an outlaw. Clamp your knees and hang on
tight. Say, Mac, we got a little pile of chips to shove into the
game any time youre shy of blues.

ROADY DUNN.
J. C. MORGAN.
SLATS HOFFMAN.
TEX GREEN.

Mrs. Stovall, who had been a very unwilling witness for the prosecution,
brought a cake and a cherry pie to the jail for him. Incidentally, she
delivered a message with which she had been commissioned.

Norma says for me to tell you that this trial doesnt fool her any. She
knows youre being punished for some of the other boys. She wanted I
should tell you that she knows you didnt intend to kill Joe.

This was an opinion becoming every day more widespread. Men began to say
that McCoy was the victim of evil chance. Shoshone County was still
determined to see justice done the murderers of Dan Gilroy, but it hoped
Rowan would escape the gallows. He had been so game throughout the
trial, so careful to bring out nothing to the prejudice of his fellow
prisoners that the hearts of men turned toward him.

The financial side of the affair was troubling the officials of the
county. The trial had been a long and expensive one. It had cost many
thousand dollars, and there was talk of grounds for an appeal. With four
other trials yet to come, it became apparent that Shoshone County would
be bankrupt long before the finish.

Roswell, acting for a group of friends, went to the prosecuting
attorney.

Look here, Haight. Youre up against it. Maybe youve got evidence to
convict these boys. Maybe you havent.

Theres no maybe about thatI have, Haight broke in grimly.

Well, say you have. That aint the point. The county cant stand the
expense of all those trials. You know that. What are you going to do
about it?

Going right ahead with the trials. We begin with Brad Rogers
to-morrow.
