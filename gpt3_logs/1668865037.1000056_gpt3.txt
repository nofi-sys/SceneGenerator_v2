Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Out so early, my darling? Mrs Crampton said, kindly; where are you
going to?

For a drive, answered the girl curtly.

But doesnt it look a little like rain, continued her mother timidly,
for she was half afraid of her idol, particularly when the idol was put
out.

I dont care if it does, replied Jenny, in the same tone; Im not
made of sugar.

But take an umbrella, darling, said her mother, anxiously, and let
Brunell hold it over you, if it should be wet.

But Miss Crampton rejected all her suggestions with scorn.

If it thunders and lightens, and I get wet through and go into a
consumption, so much the better, she exclaimed impatiently. You and
papa between you have contrived to make me so supremely miserable,
that I dont care what happens to me! In fact, the sooner Im dead the
better; and Ive a good mind to take a dose of prussic acid and end it
at once.

This is a very usual threat of selfish and ill-tempered people,
particularly if they have loving and anxious hearts to deal with. To
Mrs Crampton, to whom the girl was everything in the world, Jennys
words seem full of bitter portent.

Oh! my darling! my darling! she exclaimed, in a voice of the deepest
concern, dont say such terrible things, even in jest, for Heavens
sake! You will break my heart, Jenny, and your poor father would go mad
if he heard you speak in such an awful way. Why! we would cut off our
right hands to save you a moments trouble.

Yes! it looks like it, doesnt it? said the young lady, sarcastically.

My dearest, dont discuss the subject again. Wait a little and you
will see it perhaps in a different light. My head aches so, Jenny, I
am not fit to argue it with you, and you have been upset as well. Go
for a nice drive, and the fresh air will make your head clearer. But be
careful, my love, and dont do anything rash! Im half afraid of those
cobs, Jenny, theyre so fresh and spirited.

Oh! youre afraid of everything, replied her daughter in a tone of
contempt; and as for Aunt Clem, shes alarmed at her own shadow.

I was never brought up to horses and dogs, as you have been, dear,
said Miss Bostock, who was standing near.

No; nor to anything, I should think, replied her niece, as she
prepared to get into her Ralli cart. I often think you and mamma must
have been born and reared on a desert island, you seem so utterly
ignorant of the things most people do.

With which Miss Crampton gently touched her steeds with the lash of her
whip, and they went prancing down the drive as if they intended to
bolt, whilst her mother and aunt held their breath with anxiety, lest
the wilful driver should come to any harm.

Jenny drove at a smart pace through the principal ways of Hampstead,
whilst the pedestrians whom she passed said to each other There
goes the beautiful Miss Crampton, and she overheard some of their
remarks and flushed with pleasure at the notice she excited. For this
young ladys besetting sin was an inordinate vanity of her personal
attractions, which she had cultivated to the exclusion of all the
Christian graces. She was a specimen of that most odious of all modern
innovations, the fast girl of the nineteenth century, and she was
vulgar in consequence, for all fast women are vulgar, and obnoxious
in the eyes of everybody but their male admirers. For when will men
be ever sensible enough to separate the value of personal beauty and
mental charm? Not while they have eyes to see. Once touch their senses,
and, for the time their infatuation lasts, you cannot convince them
but that the mind and soul of their goddess equal her body in charm.
Frederick Walcheren was infatuated with the beauty of this girl, and
he believed her disposition to be all that was good and lovable as
well. It appeared so to him, for, whenever they met, Jenny was in her
best temper, and ready to be pleased with everything. Had he even seen
her, as she had been on the present occasion, rude and impertinent to
her parents, cruelly sarcastic to her meek and unoffending aunt, and
obstinately resolved upon having her own way, he would still have taken
her part, declared her to be a suffering angel, and her father and
mother most unjust and tyrannical towards her. Shakespeare never wrote
a greater truism than when he made Rosalind declare that Love is a
madness, a madness that blinds our vision, distorts our judgment, and
makes all things, not only apparently, but actually, different from
what they are; when the rose-coloured spectacles have been torn by
circumstance from our eyes, and we wonder we could ever have been such
egregious fools as to think that they were otherwise.
