SCENE:
Romain was too busy protecting the pink silk petticoats of the lady
who was to share his cab to notice his nephews face. Jean gave a
little laugh as he regarded his franc under the nearest lamppost.

Funny thing, remarked Romain to his companion, the man I tipped just
now laughed like my brother Alphonse--one had not supposed that _ces
gens-l_ could resemble ones family!

You probably gave him far too much, said the lady, with a deep sigh.
You are generous to everyone but me, and the conversation followed
its accustomed channels.

It was a wet night, and even Margots overcoat did not succeed in
keeping any warmth in Jean, and he was guilty of deliberately wondering
if it would be any colder at the bottom of the Seine. It was strange
how much he had felt his little meeting with his uncle.

He was not altogether taken by surprise next morning, when he found
himself after dressing (a process which he had noticed seemed to
lengthen itself out inordinately after a sleepless night) stretched
upon the floor, with Margot bending over him.

Whats the matter? he asked rather crossly. What are you making such
a fuss about, Margot? He felt an indisposition to get up; he was very
well where he was.

I heard you fall; you must have fainted, Jean! I knew you would! Oh, I
knew you would!

Well, never mind! said Jean. I suppose I must get up. He did not
know how much Margot helped him, but he was not sorry to find himself
lying on his bed again and staring at the ceiling.

Its only this bad cold, he said, half to himself and half to Margot.
People always have colds in the early spring. Its a bore its
raining.

Your hands are burning hot, Jean; youll stay in and keep quite quiet
to-day, wont you? Margot pleaded.

Jean made a face, but he agreed that he would stay in.

Margot immediately called in a doctor. He was as reassuring as doctors
usually are. Jean would need very careful nursing, he said; there was
a spot on his left lung, and his heart was terribly over-strained and
weak. Still, he had youth on his side. Margot mustnt be alarmed;
the first thing was to bring down the temperature and to keep up his
strength.

Margot despatched Madame Selba to her fathers friends, broke her
theatre engagements and threw herself body and soul into the struggle
with the thermometer. She would get the temperature down! Margot knew
no more than Jean how many days and weeks passed before that blessed
moment when the thermometer definitely dropped. She knew that she told
the doctor that Jean was to have everything that money could buy, and
that to buy the things the doctor ordered she spent the last of her
savings. Her days passed making poultices, cooking, pawning furniture
round the corner, thinking of all that Jean could possibly want, and
seeing that he had it. When he was quiet she prayed. She had a theory
that at night she slept.

There was only one thing that Jean wanted that Margot could not supply;
and he wanted that incessantly, and cried for it as a dying man cries
for water.

Liane! Liane! Jean moaned over and over again, and Margot tried to
get Liane for Jean. She wrote to her--and when she got back the cruel
answer: Madame de Brances knows no such person as Monsieur Jean
DUcelles and regrets that she cannot oblige Mademoiselle Selba,
Margot cried.

Sometimes he would think Margot was Liane, and then the look came into
his eyes which Margot had never seen there for herself, and Margot
would answer it with a tenderness that surely Liane had never felt for
Jean or for anyone else. And for the moment Jean would be satisfied,
only an hour later to rend her heart anew with the same low, impatient
murmur, Liane! Liane!

Yes, said the doctor with his finger on Jeans pulse and his eye on
the clock, hell pull through now, I think, but youll have to feed
him up, you know; hes had a close shave, and he is desperately weak.

The doctor was not supposed to be a sympathetic man, he had very little
time for it, and experience had buried his heart under the dust of
innumerable human needs; yet he paused for a moment as he saw the look
in Margots eyes; it was the Magnificat come to life again, and it
touched the doctor.

I should suggest your feeding up yourself, you know, he said kindly.
That young fellow owes his life to you; his kind of case depends
almost entirely on good nursing.
