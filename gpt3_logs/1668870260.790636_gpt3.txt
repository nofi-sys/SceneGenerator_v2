SCENE:
VI

CHANGED PLANS


"How ridiculous!" Jessie cried. "That surely cannot mean you, Bertha."

"Hush!" begged Amy. "It's uncanny."

Again the slow voice enunciated: "Bertha Blair will come home at once.
This is serious--a serious call for Bertha Blair."

"Criminy!" shouted Monty Shannon. "I know who that is. It's Mr. Mark
Stratford."

"He is calling for you, Bertha," said Jessie. "Can it be possible?"

"Something has happened!" gasped Bertha, starting for the door of the
cottage. "Where is that child?"

"Never mind Henrietta. We will take care of her," Jessie called after
the worried girl, wishing to relieve her anxiety.

Bertha ran out of the house, and the next moment the Roselawn girls
heard the car start. Bertha was being whisked away to Stratfordtown.
The voice of Mark Stratford continued to repeat the call several times.
Then he read the weather report, as expected.

"I can tell you one thing," Jessie said eagerly to her chum and the
Shannons. "Mark Stratford does not usually give out the announcements
from that station. Now, does he, Monty?"

"No, ma'am, Miss Jessie. Only once in a while."

"Then something has happened at the Blair house, or to Mr. Blair
himself. That is why they send out this call, hoping that somebody down
here would get it and tell Bertha."

"Think! How funny it must feel to hear your name called out of the air
in that way," Amy remarked.

"Why, we had that experience ourselves," Jessie said. "Don't you
remember? Mark thanked us publicly for finding his watch."

"But that was not just like this," replied Amy. "Anyway, there is
something unsatisfactory about radio--and always will be--until we can
'talk back' as well as receive. See! If Monty had a sending set as well
as a receiving, he could have answered Mark Stratford, and told him
Bertha had heard the call and was starting home without any delay."

"I am afraid something really serious has happened," Jessie said.
"Let's go back home and call up Stratfordtown on the telephone."

"We'll take Hen along with us," agreed Amy. "You said we'd take care of
her."

This the Roselawn girls did. When they set out from Dogtown in their
canoe, Henrietta sat amidships. She was delighted to visit the
Norwoods. She had stayed over night with Jessie before.

They passed the flotilla of tubs and barrels that the Dogtown children
had set afloat. Mrs. Shannon would never see her washtubs again.
Meanwhile the Costello twins and Charlie Foley had set out to walk
around the lake and recover the big canoe from the place where it had
drifted ashore on the other side.

"They certainly are the worst young ones," commented Amy Drew. "Always
in mischief of some kind."

"There ain't much else to get into at Dogtown," said little Henrietta
soberly. "We don't have any boy scouts or girl scouts or anything like
that. They have _them_ at Stratfordtown. Mrs. Blair told me about 'em.
I guess I'll join the girl scouts and take 'em all out on my island."

Little Henrietta was still intensely excited about "her island."
What the Roselawn girls heard over the telephone when they got home
again was not encouraging. It seemed at first that Henrietta must be
disappointed.

Jessie ran in to the telephone as soon as they arrived. She did not
know the number of Mr. Blair's private telephone--if he had one. But
she knew how to get in touch with Mark Stratford whether he was at
his home or at the offices of the Stratford Electric Company. She was
able to speak with the young man almost at once, and questioned him
excitedly.

"Yes. I know that Bertha has got home. I took a chance to reach her at
Dogtown when I heard where she had gone," Mark Stratford said. "You
know Monty Shannon is a protg of mine, and I have an idea he is
listening in most of the time at that set he has built."
