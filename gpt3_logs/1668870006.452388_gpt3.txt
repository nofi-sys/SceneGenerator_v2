SCENE:
III

_Enter John Ward_


Riley drifted to the door on his float belt, about to leave the
house for his daily trip to the museum, when the music was suddenly
interrupted. The figure of a man appeared on the television screen. He
was a rather lean, slender man, with sharp eyes, not tall, but having
the appearance of wiry toughness.

"I am John Ward," the man stated abruptly. "I have interrupted the
usual program you receive at this hour to bring you a message of vital
importance.

"Ten days ago, the automeks of India City ceased functioning. The
people of India City migrated, as has become the custom recently," he
said this with sarcasm, "to Canton City. Canton City already had three
times its normal population.

"They had no room to receive any more people. A riot followed. It
quickly became a small but bloody war. The people of India City were
thrown back into the hills in the first war this world has known in
almost nine hundred years."

The figure in the screen paused briefly to pound his right fist into
his open left palm.

"Think of that! The first war in almost nine hundred years. Why?
Because people are hungry, because they are cold and starving. There
in the hills outside Canton City they are settling down to starve to
death. A third of them are dead already. Why?

"Because they don't know how to work. Because they won't work even
if they are shown how. Think about that! People in this world--this
pleasant, peaceful world--are dying because they won't work."

Aunt Betty had caught her breath at last.

"The _idea_!" she squealed. She turned to Mr. Ashton. "Charles, shut
that dreadful man off."

Riley sprang forward.

"Wait. I want to hear what he says. If it's too shocking for you, Aunt
Betty, stick your fingers in your ears."

John Ward had become persuasive.

"You are probably wondering how this affects you. Listen. The day
before yesterday the automeks quit working in Boston City. There were
five million people living in Boston City yesterday. Tomorrow, there
won't be five hundred.

"Boston City will be dead. Those five million people will move--to
Denver City, to the City of Los Angeles, and to others. A good
proportion of them will come to American City--your own home.

"I understand that the Committee has agreed to refuse them admittance.
If it does the lives of those people will be on your heads. If they
starve it will be your fault.

"At the present time, American City can absorb its share of those
people and you can continue to live as you now are living. But
soon--can't tell you how soon--maybe five years or twenty-five--but
soon, if you are to avert complete disaster, it will be necessary for
you--and you--and you to learn how to work.

"You will be forced to work with your hands, with your brains and with
what tools you will have left to you. If you refuse, if you sit idly by
hoping, then starvation will fall upon the world. Starvation will be
upon _us_!"

Abruptly, the figure disappeared from the screen.

"The impudence!" Aunt Betty gasped. "Charles, you are a member of
the Committee. You'll have to do something about that man. Imagine!
Telecasting such an outrageous statement."

"I will," Mr. Ashton promised grimly. He began punching buttons and
calling the Committee members while Aunt Betty wailed on about the
general state of immorality in the world and Mrs. Ashton looked vaguely
disturbed.

Riley went out the door and shot rapidly down to the telecasting
station. When he got there he found it deserted except for the automeks
arranging the usual programs for the day. He wanted to meet John Ward.
He had a great admiration for any man who would speak out as Ward had
done. But though he stayed around until the Committee arrived he saw no
trace of the man who had made the telecast.
