Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Would you like me to sing for you now? asked Margot, anxious to
change the subject. I could, you know; I know that last little song of
Schuberts by heart.

Yes, do, said Jean eagerly.

Margot drew a deep breath and winced.

At least I thought I did, she murmured. She had not realized how
difficult it is to sing when you are hungry. For the last three days
she had had very little to eat.

Im so sorry, Jean, she said. Im afraid I cant without you. You
see, then, how necessary you are! You do help me!

But you havent told me how you are getting on at the theatre? Jean
persisted. Tell me, Margot! There was the first note of definite
suspicion in his voice.

Margot almost welcomed the postmans rap. She sprang up and came back
with a letter.

Its from one of your fine friends, she said, laughing. I can feel
the thick paper--and a great crest--and I think, Monsieur Jean, it is
from a lady! I shall be very discreet and go away without so much as
a question. When I come back you will tell me if her hair is black or
gold--that will be for a reward.

Dont be gone long, Margot, said Jean. I miss you so when youre
away.

He took the letter out of her hand lazily; it was the DUcelles crest;
he wondered vaguely what it was. It was not Romains writing. After all
it had seemed simpler to Romain to leave the matter to his wife--if he
could have sent money he would have written himself. But it seemed a
shabby thing to write without, and Marie would not let him send a sou.
Jean wondered if perhaps his uncle had heard of his illness and sent
him a cheque. What a pleasure and surprise that would be for Margot
when she came back; it would pay for all the extra expense she had
been put to, and if he were careful he might take her for a day in the
country.

These November days were warm and mild, with a sweet fresh sunshine in
them. He would like to see Margot in the country; she had been born
there, and he knew that she loved it. He remembered how the first time
he had heard her sing, her voice had seemed to him like the breath of
the woods. He would not open the letter till she had gone. He felt very
lazy still about doing things; it was so much more easy to think and
plan.

When Margot had given him his broth and watched him take it to the last
drop, she left him.

But now Im sure its from a lady with fair hair, she said laughing.
Or else you would have opened it! You know well enough that I detest
fair hair!

Margot did not often make little jokes but her heart had never felt so
light before. She wished that Jean could be for ever convalescent and
grateful, seeking her with the clinging eyes of a child, and that she
might always be hungry and happy, and tired, for his sake; but perhaps
not quite so hungry! They would be sure to offer her something to eat,
though, at her fathers friends, and that would last very well till
to-morrow; and there was plenty of the best bedstead left for Jean.

When Margot had gone, Jean opened his letter.

MY DEAR JEAN (his aunt had written), This is indeed sad news which
your uncle tells me! We do not quite know what to say about it; he has
asked me to write in his place, as he is bothered with some affairs.
Of course, it was my natural instinct to go to you at once, but I hear
from your Uncle Romain that it is quite impossible for me to do so.
You will understand this, I know, for though you have unfortunately
been led into a connection which is quite beneath you, you would
hardly wish your aunt to enter into the house of such a person.

My poor boy, I fear you have fallen into the little trap your uncle
warned you about some time ago, and that your illness has put you
under the very obligation we were so anxious to save you from! It is
not very agreeable for us, as you may fancy, to hear all over Paris
that our nephew is being kept at the expense of a young person of the
theatre, who has had--so I hear--to pawn the furniture to support him
during his illness! But do not fancy that I write to reproach you. I
feel that in spite of your rather ungrateful disregard of our little
plans for you in the past, as if on this very account perhaps, you
might more readily listen to a new suggestion.

Do, my dear Jean, _while there is yet time_, leave the house of this
disreputable little person and return to your Aunt Anne for awhile.
The country air will do you all the good in the world, and you might
interest yourself usefully in looking after your little estate. Let
me hear directly you are well enough to do this; and I will send your
uncles valet to meet you at the railway station with money for your
ticket, as I fear, from the reports your uncle has received, that you
must be very short of money.
