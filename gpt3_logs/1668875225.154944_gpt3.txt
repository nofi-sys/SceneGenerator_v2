Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
What is the matter, Annie dear? he asked anxiously.

Harry, what made you come up all those steps? It is too tiring for
you, said she, bending her head awkwardly to hide her tears.

I saw you from the avenue, and I saw you were crying, he answered,
as he mounted the last step and rested his hands on the low wall for
support--he was not strong enough for much exertion yet. What were you
crying about, Annie? Not because you are going away, I know.

She had turned away to wipe the tears from her face, and, as she turned
again toward him, she caught sight of her letter lying on the ground
between them. He saw it at the same moment, and, although she had the
presence of mind to pick it up very composedly, he at once came to the
conclusion that in it lay the cause of her distress.

Who is that letter from?

From Miss Taylor, who has been writing to me about the apartments I am
going to have in town, she said, as she put it into the pocket of her
mantle.

Let me see it.

She considered a minute while pretending to feel for it, and made up
her mind that it would be best to give it to him, as there was nothing
in it which was likely to have any meaning for him. So she handed him
the letter carelessly, and affected to be gazing admiringly on the
landscape while he read it. But Harry got on to the right track at once.

This Cooke--is he the Aubrey Cook Lilian talks about?

Yes; he was acting at the Piccadilly when I was there.

He is a man in the habit of making love to every woman he meets?

I dont know, I am sure. I did not know him well, and you see, as Miss
Taylor says, I never liked him.

There was a pause, but he was not satisfied.

He must be a low, vicious, unprincipled fellow! said he suddenly,
keeping his eyes fixed steadily on his wife.

Annie winced.

I suppose it is men like him who get the stage such a bad name? he
went on.

Still she said nothing, but leaned over the low battlemented wall of
the tower, and kept her eyes steadily fixed on the smoke-hung town in
the distance.

I hope there will be no such hounds in the theater you are going to,
Annie. If I thought you were going back to a place contaminated by the
presence of such an infamous scoundrel, I would not let you go!

Annie turned her head very quietly.

What has he done? said she.

Done! Havent you read that letter? Havent you heard that he is
engaged to one woman while he is hardly ever away from another--one of
the vilest of her sex? Perhaps you think nothing of that?

Well, you see, said Annie very slowly, looking full into his angry
face, I have known so many men do worse things than that. After a
minutes pause, which her husband did not attempt to fill, she went on,
I have known married men who neglected, insulted, and even struck
their wives within the very first months of marriage, who gave what
little attention they had to spare for anything so contemptible as a
woman to the lowest of the sex--men who crushed the beauty out of their
young wives by brutal carelessness and cruelty, and who thought that
years of abandonment, and almost every wrong a man can do a woman,
were amply atoned for by a burst of capricious affection--affection so
selfish that it never lost an opportunity of wounding the object of it.

Harry listened to this outburst without an interruption. His head
sunk and his chest heaved as she grew more excited; but when she had
finished, he raised his blue eyes to her face, and asked very quietly:

How have I wounded you?

Annie was not quite prepared for this. She answered, after a little
hesitation:

By insulting the profession to which I belong--which has given me all
the happiness I have known since my marriage with you.

No, said Harry, sharply. By speaking candidly about one of its
members--that is how I have hurt you; and it was just to turn me off
from abusing him that you broke out with a catalogue of my faults,
which Heaven knows I dont deny. I tell you again, I may be a brute and
a boor and anything else you like to make me out, but Im not a fool;
and, when you tell me you dislike this Aubrey Cooke, I tell you you are
lying to me.
