SCENE:
When he got outside the door, he hesitated a moment.

Wonder if it would hurt her to wake her? She might just say good-bye.
Oh, well, it is only for a fortnight! and he put on his boots and went
down-stairs.

Only a fortnight--so he thought!

When Annie woke that morning, she found the letter. It was badly
written, strangely spelled, not punctuated at all, an authentic
uninspired document evidently:

MY DEAR ANNIE,--I ought not to have to write to you at all as a
husband ought to see his wife whenever he likes and she ought to
think it a compliment but you are ill though I believe you are nearly
well now and I say no more. You dont know how sorry I am about it
all or you would be kinder for I can not ride or sleep or do anything
hardly for thinking of you. Then all say I am silly to go on like
this just for a woman and I dare say they are right in the abstrackt
but they dont know how much a man feels this sort of tretment until
they are married themselves which I hope they wont be till they are
older than you and me for a man should not marry until five-and-twenty
I am sure of that now. I do not say that to reproach you for it was
not your fault, and it is nearly as bad for you as for me and it will
all be different in a fortnight when I come back for I will be very
gentle and kind to you and I want you to promise that you wont say
any more about it nor throw it in my face afterward when you are angry
with me and that you wont always be so dredfully quiet before people
as if you were afraid of me. I know I am not good enough for you and
everybody is always telling me so and it is not at all a pleasant
thing for a fellow and I think if you were a little less good it would
be better. I would as soon you gave me a slap in the face than obey me
in the way you do like a statue or a martyr which you are not. Dont
think I want to say hard things to you for everybody will tell you
how wretched I have been and I will say a lot more to you when I see
you but now as the dog-cart is round and I have not had my breakfast
I will say good-by and if you are not awake I will put it under your
pillow. Your affectionate husband,

HARRY.

As Annie read this letter, it struck her for the first time that she
had not appreciated the extreme youthfulness of her husband, who was
much younger at twenty than she was on the eve of being nineteen. The
letter, in its boyish simplicity, amused and touched her; however, it
did not alter, but rather strengthened, a resolution which she had been
busily forming and developing during those quiet weeks of illness.

On the day following Harrys departure for Leicestershire she was
led down-stairs, being strong enough to walk now, and enthroned in
the drawing-room as a special pet and sovereign. She was rather shy
with George at first; but he knew how to be so quietly kind as to
put her at her ease. William danced wild hornpipes of joy round her,
until they threatened to turn him out for being noisy, upon which he
instantly subsided, and fell into the opposite extreme of speaking only
in a thick whisper. All the rest were kind, Lilian rather ashamed of
herself, but grateful to Annie for not having mentioned her name to
indiscreet Harry on that eventful Christmas night.

George, after another stormy interview with his sister in the library,
in which she had been in a position to give him back taunt for taunt,
wisely agreed to bury all allusion to that nights events, and merely
used the power they gave him to insist on her marrying Mr. Falconer
sooner than she wished. It had been a miserable business, that moonlit
scene in the copse, requiring hushing up all round, but especially on
Lilians account; so her eldest brother and Colonel Richardson had had
to content themselves with an exchange of hard words, and the latter
had returned to the station and the former to the house, each with an
uneasy consciousness that he had never appeared to less advantage in
his own eyes in his life.

By the time Annie came down-stairs for the first time, the preparations
for Lilians wedding were already in progress; and, when Annie
suggested to Lady Braithwaite that she thought she wanted change of
air, the latter offered to take her away to the seaside as soon as
Lilian was married, saying she could not leave home before. But Annie
thanked her, and said she would be well enough to travel by herself in
a day or two; and she wanted to go as soon as she could to her aunts,
she thought.

When George heard of it, he begged his sister-in-law to wait until
after the wedding, when he himself would take both her and his mother
to Southport. She thanked him, but without accepting or declining the
proposal.

On the very day before Harrys expected return, however, George having
left home early in the morning for a days hunting, Annie came into the
morning-room--where Lady Braithwaite and her daughter were inspecting
some newly arrived wedding presents--dressed for a journey.
