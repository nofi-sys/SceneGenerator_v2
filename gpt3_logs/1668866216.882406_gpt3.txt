SCENE:
XXIII

SILVAS STORY


When Maida woke up the next morning, it was to the sound of a babys
crying. It was not however a sick cry; it was a sleepy cry. She glanced
swiftly at the clock; then jumped out of bed. Rosie was standing in the
doorway, Nesta, wearing one of Delias nightgowns, in her arms.

You never woke me up, Rosie Brine, Maida accused her friend.

I tried to, Rosie replied. Honest I did. But you couldnt seem to
wake up. And when I realized what a day you had yesterday and what a
day might be before you, I thought it would be better to let you sleep.
Laura and I got breakfast. Weve given the baby her bath and I am now
taking her to bed.

Maida kissed the little curly, dusky head. She looks fine, she said
approvingly. Im so glad I can give Silva such good news.

What time did you say you had to call there?

Ten oclock.

Its now half past eight, Rosie said. And here comes Laura with your
breakfast.

As Rosie disappeared with her sleeping burden, Laura appeared at the
stairs carrying a tray.

Hop back into bed, Maida Westabrook, she said serenely. Youre going
to have your breakfast in bed this morning--like a princess.

Maida meekly hopped back as ordered and Laura placed the tray on the
bed in front of her. On it, the peel so divided that it looked like a
great golden-petaled flower, was an orange; a dish of oatmeal; an egg
in an egg cup; two pieces of toast; a small pitcher of milk; sugar.
Around the plate was wreathed nasturtiums, flowers and leaves.

Oh how good it looks! Maida said; and then after a few moments of
enthusiastic eating, Oh, how good it _tastes_! How dainty youve made
this tray, Laura! Im sure youre going to be the best housekeeper
among us. You like housekeeping, dont you?

I just love it, Laura replied.

I hate it. Rosie who now reappeared in the doorway, declared
emphatically. I wish you could buy blocks of dishes the way you buy
blocks of paper; sos you could tear off a clean set for every meal;
then burn them up. I wish you could buy blocks of clothes just the same
way.

What a queer thing you are, Rosie! Laura exclaimed. I just love to
have pretty things, crocheted and knit and embroidered--dainty china
and glass--and keep everything neat and shining.

Maida reflectively tapped the top of her egg; meditatively removed
the little bit of broken shell; absently salted and buttered it;
thoughtfully tasted it. I dont know what I like, she declared after
a while, I like to do anything--if Im doing it with people I love.
But I just despise to do anything with people I dont like.

An hour later, Maida, one foot on the pedal of her bicycle was
accepting last orders in regard to marketing from Rosie and Laura;
giving equally hurried advice to them.

Dont forget to buy all the different kinds of berries you can find,
Rosie said. Berries make such an easy dessert.

And oh, if there are any tomatoes yet, order all you can find, Maida,
Laura chimed in. I can make so many things with tomatoes: tomato and
macaroni; tomato and crackers; stewed tomatoes and boiled tomatoes.

And dont let the fire go out, Maida replied, and always have some
one near the telephone if anybody calls up. And remember, if the baby
doesnt seem all right, telephone for the doctor at once. Get the
hospital on the telephone at nine oclock and ask how Mrs. Dore is this
morning. Then mounting her machine in a flash, Maida was off like a
bird.

Who would ever have thought, Rosie said looking after her, that the
Maida Westabrook who first came to Primrose Court--so pale and thin and
lame--would ever grow into such a strong girl? Do you remember, Laura?

Of course I do. My mother didnt think she was going to live.

In the meantime, Maida was proceeding down the dewy trail, the prey to
some worry but with a gradually-growing, comfortable feeling that her
troubles were all over and that now things would go smoothly. She did
all the marketing that had been intrusted to her and was even able,
being the first on the spot, to secure a basket of early tomatoes for
Laura. As for berries--they were everywhere. Maida ordered, a little
recklessly, blueberries, blackberries, currants. It was ten oclock
as she had agreed--Maida was a very prompt little girl, having been
brought up to promptness by a business-like father--ten oclock to the
dot, when she walked up the Fosdick path and knocked on the door by
means of a big brass knocker.
