SCENE:
This lady, whose coarseness had in the very first days of their forced
acquaintanceship on tour disgusted Annie, had nevertheless shown the
latter so much good-natured kindness in many little ways, and notably
when the younger actress was ill with neuralgia, that it was impossible
for her not to receive the unwelcome guest with cordiality.

Miss West had dyed her hair a new color since their last meeting, but
the dye was wearing off; her face was thin and ghastly, her gloves
were in holes, her dress was more haphazard than ever, and her whole
appearance suggestive of hard times and even of scanty fare. She
greeted Annie with her old loud geniality.

Ah, Miss Langton, youre up, and Im down! I hardly dared to come and
call upon such a howling swell as you have become. You are not sorry to
see an old friend though, I see.

I am very sorry to see you looking so ill, though, said Annie,
sincerely. You used not to look like that in the country. You want
change of air.

No, no, my dear; youre wrong there. No actress wants change of air
when once shes got to London. Its an engagement I want. Ive been
out for six weeks, and see no prospect of being in again. I dont know
whether you can help me; but Ive come to ask your advice on one or two
matters.

I will come in and see you presently, Annie, said Stephen, going
toward the door. I have nothing much to say to you, and I came chiefly
to see whether you had any commissions for me.

Yes, yes, I have! I have a letter for you to take, and I want to see
you most particularly. Come back and have tea with me, will you?

He promised to do so; and Annie, who was dying to hear all he had to
tell her about her husband, was obliged reluctantly to let him go, and
to listen instead to the long list of grievances and complaints against
London managers and things in general which Miss West proceeded to
entertain her with in language much stronger than was necessary.

Annie had noticed upon her first entrance that Stephen and Miss West
were in animated converse, and that the former seemed very much
engrossed by his companion. He now turned with eagerness to her again,
and asked whether he should have the pleasure of meeting her on his
return. But Annie did not invite Miss West to stay to tea. So he left,
casting at the very last moment an ardent and expressive glance at the
object of his evident admiration.

The two women had not been many minutes alone together before Annie
discovered that the real object of her visitor was to discover whether
her more prosperous fellow-artist could oblige her with a loan. Annie
had some money to spare, and could not refuse, especially as she felt
that fate had been capricious in giving her a good engagement and the
chance she had pined for, while Miss West, who she felt was really the
greater actress of the two, was out of work and restlessly longing for
an opportunity of distinction, as she herself had so long been.

Miss West had not been gone more than a few minutes when Stephen
returned, and Annie asked anxiously for news of Harry, which his cousin
seemed chary of imparting to her.

Cant you tell me where he is and how he is, Stephen? she asked
impatiently.

I cant tell you where he is, because he is traveling about, and I
dont know myself where he is at this moment. But he is quite well, and
I havent seen him in such good spirits for a long time.

Oh, said Annie, her face falling involuntarily. I am very glad to
hear that! Does he--I suppose he doesnt speak of coming to town?

Oh, dear, no! You know Harry hates town; he is not like the same man
now he has got back into the country again, and to--

Here Stephen pulled himself up short and Annie said quietly, with
tightened lips:

Go on, Stephen. Harry is happier now he has got back to--what?

Oh, I only meant the country air and the country people! You know he
is a regular rustic, and Londoners dont suit him.

Annie gulped down the tears this unlucky speech brought to her eyes,
and said, with forced cheerfulness:

Yes, he is, of course, much happier in the country.

Of course, admitted Stephen, guardedly. He has sent you this letter.

She tore it open. It was only a short note, very affectionate, but with
no definite word concerning his own movements. A sudden impulse of
angry pride seized her, and shame at the long letter she had prepared
in exchange for this brief, hurriedly-written note. She took up the
letter she was about to send, and, excusing herself to Stephen, went
into the next room, tore it into shreds, and, hastily writing a note as
short and as vague as her husbands own, returned and gave that as her
answer.
