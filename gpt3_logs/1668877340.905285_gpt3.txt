SCENE:
X

CORIN THEORIZES


CORIN, from the depths of one armchair, regarded John in the depths of
another.

For sheer, racy, brilliant conversation commend me to you, he
remarked sarcastically. For the last hour at least--Ive had my eye on
the clock--youve uttered no single word. Youve rivalled the immortal
Williams lover in your sighs. Talk of _a_ furnace, its like ten
furnaces youve been. Sigh, sigh, and again sigh. Whats the matter
with you, man? Is it love, sorrow, or remorse for an ill-spent youth?
Come, out with it. Disburden your soul of the worm i the bud which is
feeding on your damask cheek. Speak, I implore you.

John roused himself.

Oh, he responded airily enough, in the matter of conversation
I fancied wed had enough of it at dinner--supper--whatever the
original, but wholly appetizing meal might be called. We conversed
pretty tolerably, I fancy.

Conversation! Corins voice expressed a depth of utter scorn.
Conversation! If thats what he calls the airy, frothy, soap-bubble
words which fell from his lips! Oh, you didnt deceive me. I saw
in them the mere cloak to an aching heart. You just over-did the
lighthearted careless rle. Youve said fifty times more in the last
hour. But now I want the translation, the interpretation. Wheres the
use of first frivolling, and then glooming? Strike the happy medium.
Come, consider me a confidant, he ended on a note of coaxing.

John laughed. Then he relapsed into gloom, frowning.

Its no laughing matter, he said.

It wasnt I who laughed, urged Corin gently. Come, tell me.

Oh, well, said John stretching out his legs. And forthwith he set
himself to speak, succinctly, concisely.

Bless the man! cried Corin at the end of the recital, so its that
thats weighing on his mind.

Well? demanded John surprised, and not a little injured. And isnt
it enough to weigh on a mans mind? Isnt it an entirely unparalleled
situation? Isnt it an unthinkable, inconceivable situation?

Corin waved his cigarette in the air.

Oh, Ill grant you all that. But youre too susceptible. Youre
too--too ultra-sympathetic. It isnt _your_ Castle. It isnt _your_
relation that has appeared unwanted from the other side of Nowhere. It
isnt _you_ who have got to take a back seat and see Americans vault
over your head into the position you have just vacated. He stopped.

Oh, well, said John frigidly, if thats the way you look at things.

Corin sighed.

Its the only sensible way.

Hang sense, muttered John.

My dear fellow, urged Corin soothingly, look at matters in a
reasonable light. Here are you sighing, frowning, suffering real
mental pain on behalf of a family--a quite picturesque and interesting
family, Ive no doubt, but one with which you have the barest bowing
acquaintance, the merest superficial knowledge. Your attitude isnt
reasonable, its altogether exaggerated and beside the mark.

Its merely ordinary decent human sympathy, retorted John.

Corin raised his light arched eyebrows till they nearly touched his
light straight hair.

Then, he remarked coolly, defend me from your company when you are
suffering from extraordinary human sympathy. Seriously, though, he
went on, arent you being a trifle _exalt_ in the matter? Arent you
plunging the sword of sympathy a bit too deeply into your heart? For a
moment--just for one brief infinitesimal moment--consider facts as they
are. Here are we two, dropped by the merest chance upon this place,
fallen upon it by the merest freak of fortune--three weeks ago Id
never even heard of its existence--and weve really no more individual
connection with it than with--with Mount Popocatepetl. What possible
reason, or, I might say, what right or justification, has either one of
us to take to heart the private and personal trials of a family living
here. Its--its almost an impertinence. We arent in the picture at
all. Were altogether superfluous to them. Look at the whole thing
from the point of view of an audience, continued Corin blandly. A
month or two hence the curtain will have fallen on this little drama,
as far as we are concerned. We arent on the stage at all.
