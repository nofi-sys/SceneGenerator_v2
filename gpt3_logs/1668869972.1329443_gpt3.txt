SCENE:
"What hotel? Where was it?"

"The Mansion House, Main Street, Buffalo."

Beverton shook in the knees. She had named the hotel where his parents
had stopped while traveling--where he had last walked in his sleep.

"Grace," he said, as firmly and gently as he could with his tongue
trembling against the roof of his mouth. "He did not mean to hurt you;
he did not know you at the time. He will never hurt you. You must never
seek him again, either to kill or explain to him. He is satisfied."

"Has he forgiven? Does he realize that--that--I--that--"

Her face became troubled again, and she reached forth her hands,
clutching at the air, as though trying to grasp the elusive memory.

"Yes, he has forgiven," said Beverton, steadier of voice now at the
apparent success of the experiment. "And you will never seek him again,
will you? It is all settled now."

"All settled," she repeated, while her countenance softened.

"You will not worry any more, will you?"

"No more. It is all settled. He has forgiven me."

"You will never walk in your sleep again, will you, Grace?"

"No, it is all settled. He has forgiven me."

Had Beverton sent her to bed now he might have spared himself a
life-long puzzle which ever baffled solution; but, with fairly good
command of himself, he yielded to curiosity, and asked:

"What had you done to him? What had he to forgive?"

Her face became convulsed; the query seemed a blow that gave her agony.
With arms extended and fingers clutching again, she tottered, but did
not fall; and he mercilessly repeated the question. She did not answer,
and he, blindly desirous of prompting her, reached for the knife on the
sideboard.

"Had it anything to do with this?" he asked.

"The scimitar," she exclaimed, hoarsely. "I killed her with it." Then
she pressed her hands to her brow, held them tightly, and her eyes
closed, while her frame stiffened visibly under the pressure. When she
removed her hands and looked at him, she seemed another person; for in
her eyes was the strange, hard expression they had worn when she had
dozed off in her chair. They lighted on the carving-knife, and before
he could move she pounced upon him and wrenched it from his hand.

"Ha," she exclaimed, in the same harsh, raspy voice as before; "and
would the seorita harm herself--or me? 'Tis a pretty plaything"--she
ran her finger along the edge--"but too sharp for the Lady Isobel.
Moorish make, I trow--we took it from the Spanish plate-ship off
Tortuga--but better fit to slay than to prod. And had ye thought, my
obstinate charmer, that when my patience is given out, it may be this
that shall slit your smooth white throat?" With a meaning and somewhat
quizzical smile at him, she laid the knife on the sideboard.

Beverton kept his nerve, remembering her recent amenability to his
suggestions.

"Who are you?" he asked, tentatively, seeking an opening for further
inquiry.

"Ha-ha," she laughed. "An idle question to ask of Hal Morgan. Are ye
so little informed of a man known to your countrymen from Madrid to
Panama?"

"And where are you?"

"Where am I? Where indeed, but in the stateroom of my Lady Isobel, who,
if I mistake not, is still intractable. We will try the water-cure, for
once more." She lifted her face to the ceiling and called: "On deck
there. A bucket o' water. Send it below by the steward."

As though the order were obeyed, she stepped to the kitchen-door, just
beyond which was the sink; and from this she lifted at arm's length--a
feat of strength impossible to her when awake--the pail of water
which always stood there. Turning toward him she swung it backward,
one hand supporting it, the other gripping the bottom edge, and would
have deluged him had he not spoken. "Wait," he said, sternly. "The
water-cure will not avail."

Her eyes wavered before his steady gaze, and she slowly lowered the
pail to the floor. For a moment it seemed that she would waken, or at
least lapse into softer mood; for her features grew composed, and her
eyes lost their glitter; but they rested on the knife, and immediately
hardened.
