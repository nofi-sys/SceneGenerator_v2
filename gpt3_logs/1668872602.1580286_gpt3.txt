SCENE:
She leaned over, snapped the telenews switch, and pointed to the
wall-screen. A headline flashed on.

GERRY CARLYLE SPURNS RESCUE PLEA!

Angrily, Gerry spun a dial to reveal a second lead.

QUEEN OF HUNTRESSES SHIES AWAY FROM TRITON CHALLENGE!

Miss Gerry Carlyle, the Catch-'em-Alive girl renowned the world
over for her adventures while raiding the Solar System for weird
monsters, today rejected the plea of Lawrence Dacres that she put
her spaceship, _The Ark_, at his disposal for the rescue of his
brother, believed lost on Triton.

Mr. Dacres alleges that fear of unknown forces upon the lonely,
unexplored satellite of Neptune prompted the refusal.

It is true that Triton's record of being the grave of more than one
ill-fated expedition is cause enough to make anyone wary. But if,
as is asserted, something has been discovered at last which gives
pause to the redoubtable Miss Carlyle, then man, indeed, bites dog.

Gerry's furious fingers again moved, and a third line of heavy type
declared:

SWEETHEART OF SPACE SHUNS SIREN SATELLITE!

Strike sniggered. Gerry interrupted.

"I had a few words with the editor who dreamed that one up," she said
with quietly vicious satisfaction. "He is now resting in a sanitarium."

Strike sighed.

"I can see what an awkward position it puts you in," he admitted. "The
Dacres fellow's already tried the case in the press and found you
guilty of something or other."

He rose, walked around behind Gerry. Presently his voice came again,
musingly.

"Now let's see. Triton. Diameter, three thousand miles. Revolution,
five days, seven hours, three minutes. Stellar magnitude--"

"You sound like an encyclopedia." Gerry twisted around, trying to see.

"That's because I'm reading from an encyclopedia, I'll bet.... Stellar
magnitude at opposition, thirteen. Retrograde motion. Gravity, two
and a half times that of Earth--Oh, yeah. That's why they call it the
'siren satellite.' It lures the unwary space-traveller close, then
hauls him in with the unexpected gravity.... Mmm. Composed of matter
not native to the Solar System--hence the terrific mass. Believed to
be a wanderer from space trapped by Neptune. That would explain the
retrograde motion."

Brisk, muffled footsteps sounded along the corridor, followed by an
impatient knock on the pilot room door.

"That'll be friend Dacres now." Gerry grimaced. "Come in!"

Dacres made his entrance. He was not self-important, but he was
imposing, and whenever he entered a room he would inevitably command
attention. He was tall, slender in the manner of a rapier, and blond.
He bowed stiffly.

"Good morning, Miss Carlyle," he said.

Gerry almost expected to hear his heels click. She introduced the two
men, mentally compared them, as all women do.

"So you've come to apologize for your insufferable conduct?" she said
then.

"I've come to see if you have reconsidered your unfriendly and
uncooperative attitude," he amended.

Gerry began to incandesce.

"Why, you--you--" she could scarcely contain herself. "You deliberately
spread lies and false insinuations through the press, making me a
laughing-stock, blasting my reputation, impugning my courage! And now
you have the crust to pretend that I'm in the wrong for not throwing my
whole organization into the lap of every would-be joyrider who comes
along! You're nothing but a blackmailer!"

Dacres refused to be stampeded.

"Sorry to exert pressure on you in such fashion, Miss Carlyle," he
said, unperturbed. "As you imply, however, I have no scruples. None, at
least, when my brother's life is at stake."
