Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Topham leaned back and let his eyes rove over the expanse of city and
bay beneath the windows. No scene could be more peaceful. War seemed
to him far-off and impossible.

You really think they mean to fight? he questioned. His tones
expressed doubt, though much less than he felt.

Of course! Of course! No doubt at all! They want to fight and they
will fight. The only question is as to when theyll fight. Japan means
to be the England of the Pacific, and she means to dominate China,
including Corea and Manchuria. The open door--Bah! No Japanese intends
to allow it a moment longer than he must. Oh! theyll fight! And
theyre getting ready to fight now.

Topham listened respectfully. Listening was Tophams long suit. But he
did not for an instant believe.

Is there anything new, he asked. Things seemed quiet enough in
Manila. Of course, I was there for only a day and hadnt much time to
pick up details. There was something in one of the papers about some
trouble in San Francisco, I believe; but--

Thats the opening. A sort of gambit, you know. The Japs there claim
they have a treaty right to send grown Japanese men to study in the
public schools with white boys and girls--girls, you understand. Its
intolerable, of course! But they are using it as a pretext to stir
up bad blood. Theyre cunning. They are trying to make capital for
themselves in Europe and particularly in England. Blood is thicker
than water and theyll have to have a mighty good excuse for war with
the United States if they want Englands sympathy. And whats more,
the secretary leaned forward, I have reason to believe that they are
dickering with Germany!

Topham started and picked up his glass hastily, to mask his movement.
Since he had met the Countess Elsa, any mention of Germany made his
pulses stir.

Natural enough, isnt it? he questioned. Of course Japan would want
to be on good terms with Germany. Probably she would like to be on
terms with France, too; and perhaps even with Russia. But why should
that mean anything against the United States. Frankly, Stites, Im from
Missouri on the Japanese question. Youll have to show me!

Events will do that all right, rejoined the other, a trifle grimly.
But, with Germany, its scarcely a question. Ever since that woman got
here--

What woman?

The smartest, prettiest woman I ever knew and thats saying something.
Say, Topham, did you ever play stud-poker?

Well, Ive _heard_ of it, admitted the officer, grinning.

Oh! Have you? Well! you know how its played? The dealer deals one
card around face down, and everybody looks at it secretly. Then he
deals around again and again, card by card, all face up, until each man
has a full poker hand. After each round, you bet what you like. All
the cards in all the hands except one are exposed. Its the one secret
card that makes the doubt in the game. Only one card, and yet it makes
the game more exciting than if all five were hidden. Well! diplomacy is
much like that--especially diplomacy as this woman plays it. She has
shown all her cards except one--what Germany is to get out of it all. A
mighty clever woman, Topham, and as pretty as she is clever.

Who is she?

Well, now, who knows. She calls herself-- the secretary broke off
and craned his neck, trying to make out more clearly the identity of
a little group of people who had just entered the dining-room. She
usually comes here to dine, he went on, slowly, And maybe--yes! There
she is. Shes the lady approaching--the one in grey. She calls herself
the Countess Elsa del Ouro Preto. Sounds Spanish, but she is really
German as they make em.

Topham never knew how he got to his feet. There was a roaring in his
ears and the lights danced around him. Only one thing held steady--the
splendid eyes of the Countess Elsa.

She was coming toward him. Her tiny jewelled slippers made no sound on
the mats that covered the floor, but her silken robes swished as she
moved. In the aureole of her hair trembled a single diamond; a belt of
rubies clasped her waist. Ah! How beautiful she was. How she fitted
into the scheme of things in this bizarre eastern world! Tophams glass
shattered in his hand and the pieces tinkled on the floor as he looked.

Then she saw him. For an instant the traitor blood ebbed to her
heart, leaving her face whiter than man had ever seen it before.
Then it rushed back in a crimson tide, burning. But she walked on.
Her eyes held Tophams for a second; then wandered indifferently
past. Carelessly she turned to the huge blonde German who walked by
her side--a man with the broad ribbon of the Black Eagle across his
breast--and made some laughing remark. Indifferently, without sign of
recognition, she passed--passed to where an obsequious waiter held a
chair ready.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene is set in a restaurant, where two men are talking. One of the men, Topham, is from Missouri and is skeptical of the other man's claim that Japan is preparing for war with the United States. The other man, Stites, is certain of it, and says that the Japanese are being aided by a clever and beautiful German woman who is working against the United States. Topham is shocked to hear this, as he has recently met a German woman named Countess Elsa del Ouro Preto who he finds very attractive.
Countess Elsa enters the restaurant with a German man, and Topham is instantly drawn to her. He is so mesmerized by her beauty that he doesn't even hear what she is saying to the man she is with. Topham's glass shatters in his hand as he looks at her, and she eventually notices him. For a moment, she looks scared, but then she walks over to him and they talk. Topham is so enchanted by her that he doesn't even hear what she is saying.
