Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
It was now clear that if we ever got out of wherever we were, we would
have to do it on our own.

First, to establish the exact circumference of the dome, I formed all
hands, sailors, marines and Japanese, in a single column and we did
the circle. I wanted everybody whose lot was our lot, to know every
detail that might later prove valuable. The area under our feet,
available to us within the dome, we estimated at ten acres. That gave
us considerable inner surface of wall and dome to be studied. We could
not see the dome, we only knew it was there. We had small radar and
sonar sets, but the dome registered on neither. Nothing we shouted was
echoed back to us, nor did the chattering of the fast-firers cause
reverberations. With those fast-firers, the ultimate in small arms,
we searched out every quadrant of the dome, to see if there were any
opening. In the same way we searched out every yard of the wall;
there was no way out, at least of any size, for I'd have wagered, so
carefully was this job done, that if one bullet fired into dome or wall
had fallen outside, some one of us would have spotted it.

We used up a lot of steel-jacketed bullets, but we found not a single
aperture in the wall or dome.

Next we worked on our super-grenades, of which we had a fairly good
supply. This was dangerous work; we had to dig trenches from which
to heave them. Even the rifle grenades were dangerous because of our
limited escape area.

The grenades did nothing to the wall; nothing whatever.

The flame-throwers accomplished little more. There was danger with
these, too, for the flame bathed the wall--we could see it strike and
blossom up and down--and backfired so that it was a wonder all who
stood behind the machines were not wiped out. And even the flames did
not affect the wall.

We even, so help me, tried to _talk_ a hole through the wall! Yes,
Krane thought of it, Trumpeter Krane.

"Maybe we could find the key sound of the dome," he said, "and shatter
it with sound. You know, like marching steps shaking down a bridge."

Well, we tried, but got nowhere.

"Shovels, then," I said. "Entrenching tools! Maybe we can go under."

All hands groaned. There is nothing a marine or sailor dislikes more
than digging in--even when bullets are flying thick and fast.

I think we were all a little mad then. It was bad enough to dig down
into sand that poured into a hole faster than one could dig, but to
accomplish nothing by doing it was heartbreaking. By day we perspired
like hippos, rubbed the skin off our palms, got raw and bleeding where
our clothes chafed. Water and food were no problem, for our mysterious
source of supply never for a moment ceased or abated.

We fought that wall for days and nights on end, as a mob, in shifts,
and singly. We got nowhere. There were times when the sand inside the
dome looked as if a huge animal had been rooting, or a crowd digging
for treasure. But when we stopped for a few moments to rest we could
hear the sand whispering with glee as it slid back into the pits we had
dug--leveling off the area again.

We managed in some places to get down ten feet or so into the sand, and
to witness a strange phenomenon. We never got under the wall, nor were
we able to penetrate it anywhere, yet when sand poured back into the
pits we dug--_it poured back from beyond the wall, too_, as if there
were no obstruction! It poured in, apparently through the very wall we
were trying to breach.

Naturally we wondered, if we had been digging on the outside, trying
to get in, if the sand would have poured outward into the holes, too.
We all remembered how we had got into the dome so easily, yet we could
find no way, shape, form or manner to get out.

The Shadow Men, however, had escaped....

Yes, we studied that LCVP that had seemed to be a funnel by which the
Shadow Men coalesced into one shadow and vanished, but could find no
key to the means or manner of their strange escape.

We were resting one afternoon, and Haggerty had just said this was the
most unsatisfactory duty he had ever performed in twenty-some years
of landing with the marines around the world, while Hoose suggested
we ought to have a name for this nameless area, and Trumpeter Krane
offered "Outpost Zero" as the most appropriate--when Preble erupted:
"My God! Look!"

He was pointing up through the dome. Spinning down toward us from an
empty sky was a ball of something that looked like metal--or perhaps
crystal. It glistened and shone in the sun. It almost hurt the eyes.


BRIEF OUTLINE:

==========

-A group of sailors, marines, and Japanese are stuck inside a dome with no way out.
-They search for a way out, but find none.
-The Shadow Men escape, but the group is unable to figure out how.
-A ball of metal or crystal falls from the sky and the group is surprised.
