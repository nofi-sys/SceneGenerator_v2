Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
The moment they reached the ranch yard of the X Bar X, Mr. Manley
leaped from the car. A cowboy, who was leaning against the corral
fence, craned his neck forward in surprise. The boss riding in an
auto!

Nick, Mr. Manley called sharply to the puncher, our broncs have
been rustled. Were goin out after em! You and Gus Tripp get your
ponies an three others for Roy an Teddy an me. Bring your guns.
Short, terse sentences. Mr. Manley was no longer a cattle owner. He
was a cowboy, whose pony had been stolen.

Right! Nick Looker answered. He disappeared around the corner of
the bunk-house.

As Mr. Manley walked rapidly towards the ranch house, he called back
over his shoulder:

Nell an Ethel, we all expect you over for a visit. Excuse me
runnin away like this. Teddy, fetch in my bag.

Dad means business, Roy said in a low voice. Having General
stolen has hit him pretty hard. Theres mother.

A womans figure appeared on the porch of the house, and in a moment
she was enfolded in Mr. Manleys arms. Mrs. Manleys eyes widened in
surprise when she saw the auto and missed the horses; and Mr. Manley
explained briefly what had occurred. Questions were trembling on her
lips, but she did not delay her husband with them. Mr. Manley kissed
her again, and, turning, rushed into the house.

As Mrs. Manley walked toward the auto, Nell and Ethel could scarcely
believe that this radiant young-looking woman was the mother of two
big boys.

Welcome to the West, she said, with a smile, as she extended a
hand to each of the girls. Mr. Manley has told me who you are. This
is Ethel, isnt it? And Nell? Ethel instantly noticed how much, in
a curious way, both Roy and Teddy resembled her. Teddy had her
blonde hair and blue eyes. Roy had her sensitive, fine mouth.

Belle Ada, the sister of Roy and Teddy, now came out of the house
and toward the car, evidently having been told by Mr. Manley that
there were visitors. As she was introduced, she mentally decided
that she liked Nell and Ethel. That was like Belle Ada--impulsive
and eager to make friends.

Im afraid well have to go now, Nell said, after a few moments
conversation. Uncle Peter will be waiting for us.

But you will come over and visit me? Belle Ada asked, her dark
eyes on the two girls.

Of course we will! Ethel answered. As soon as we can!

Teddy seized his fathers bag from the rear of the auto, and he and
Teddy shook hands with the girls. Bug Eye jammed down the pedal. The
car leaped forward. As it swung about, the girls leaned out and
waved farewells.

Pretty nice! Roy said, as he watched the car being swallowed up in
a cloud of dust. Pretty nice!

Mrs. Manley smiled. Then, remembering what her husband had told her
on the porch, the smile left her face.

Boys, you go in and speak to your father, she said. He wants to
tell you something. Belle and I will walk around to the garden and
wait until you come out. You--you will be careful if you ride with
him after those rustlers, wont you? Her eyes held an anxious
light.

Dont worry, Mom! Teddy cried, kissing his mother affectionately.
Well be all right. Theres no danger!

The two boys walked stiffly toward the house.

Wonder what it is? Teddy mused. You know, I have a hunch that dad
found out more from those fellows down at the corral in Eagles than
he told.

Maybe, came from Roy. Well soon know.

They met their father coming out of the front door. His city
clothes had been changed for a pair of leather chaps and a flannel
shirt, open at the neck. Across one arm he carried a rifle.

Want us, Dad? Roy asked.

Yes. Before we start, I want to tell you something. Teddy, you
remember Gilly Froud, dont you?
