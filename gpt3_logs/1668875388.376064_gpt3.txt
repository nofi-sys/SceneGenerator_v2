SCENE:
XXV.


Dont go to the theater to-night, Annie! Send a note to say you are
not well, suggested George, when they reached the house where his
sister-in-law was living. You are not fit to act to-night; they must
get somebody else, he added, with the charming simplicity of the
outsider in theatrical matters, who does not know how loath the
rising actress is to give her understudy a chance of proving that she
herself is not indispensable to the success of the piece.

I must go, George; and it will be the best thing for me, said she,
with a grateful look at his anxious face. Come and see me to-morrow; I
want to talk to you.

He left her unwillingly, and that night he took a stall at the theater
where she was acting that he might be at hand in case she broke down.
But there was no need of such a fear for the trained actress; her
performance that night was, to a close observer, somewhat fitful and
unequal; but she gave no other sign of the shock she had sustained
that day--in fact, the excitement caused by it prevented her physical
weariness from being so apparent.

The next morning, however, when George called, he found her sad and
subdued, in spite of the efforts she made to seem as cheerful as usual.
When she referred to the previous day, she did so quite calmly; but his
self-command about the matter was not so great as hers, and he broke
out in a few minutes and swore that he would find Harry out and upbraid
him for his infamous conduct to the most perfect woman in the world.

I am not that, George; and Harry knows it--that is the worst of it! If
you were to tell him you and I had both recognized my jewels on another
woman, he would tell you that it was only to be even with me for having
preferred to his the society of another man.

George looked at her in astonishment, for she spoke with bitter
self-reproach and kept her eyes away from his.

My dear Annie, you are reproaching yourself very unnecessarily. When
Harry himself behaved to you like a coal-heaver, even he could scarcely
be surprised that you preferred any society to his.

Not any society--I did not mean that.

No, but that of men of his own rank, but not quite of his manners,
said George, drawing his chair a little nearer to hers.

I did not mean that either. As long as I preferred any society to his,
it didnt matter. So I thought myself safe; it seemed quite natural to
dislike and fear Harry when he neglected me and snubbed me, and bullied
and at last struck me. I felt that, if I stayed with him any longer,
his very presence would poison me, said she with rising excitement.

No wonder! You were quite right to leave him, and, if you had been
wise, you would never have come back to the brute.

Do you think so? Now I think I was quite wrong. Even if I could not
have loved him, it would have been safer to stay with him, safer for
him and for me.

Safer for you!

Yes, yes. I thought I was so strong, so hard, that I could do without
affection altogether--especially as affection could, since my foolish
marriage, only mean Harrys. And I was foolish and cared for him too
little to ask myself whether he could do without it as well.

He had shown that he didnt deserve yours, at all events. If you had
stayed at the Grange, I think you might have been happy, Annie; but it
would have been thanks to your husbands family, and not to him. You
see, Lilian was just going to be married, and my mother would soon have
warmed to you when her other daughter was gone; and, if Harry had not
changed his tone, I would have packed him off somewhere, and then you
would have been surrounded by nothing but worshipers. And, if you had
liked the Grange better in those circumstances, my dear child, I dont
think any one could have blamed you.

I think they would, though. You see, my fault all through my married
life has been that I looked upon my husband as a contemptible tyrant to
be given way to or avoided as the case might be, never as a reasonable
being whose opinions and feelings were to be considered for their own
sake.

But you see he has proved that they are not worth considering. I own
to you that, when he was getting better, and he seemed never happy when
you were out of his sight, and you went on laughing and talking with
any of us rather than with him, and treated him like a cross, spoiled
child, to be given way to and coaxed, while he seemed always longing
and trying to be something more to you--it did seem to me sometimes
that it was rather rough on Harry; but now I see you were quite right,
and it was a good thing you did not get fond of such a weathercock. And
then, when he rushed up to town red-hot to see you, and found you all
dull and solitary----
