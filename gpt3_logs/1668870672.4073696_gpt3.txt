SCENE:
The door opened and he went in, leaving them staring at the house over
which death was hovering.

Clean and fresh-looking the house stood among its squalid surroundings
of dirty stables, frowsy, ill-smelling drains and pestilential manure
pits. Its stone steps were spotless, the brass bell knob was as bright
as burnished gold, the pretty curtains at the windows like snow. And
this was the home of the landlord of the court--the clean, bright,
comfortable home he had dreamed of years before, when he stepped from
the emigrant ship to begin life in a new land.

He was dying now, and the money for which he had slaved and demeaned
himself--the money which he had hoarded and loved--was about to pass
from him. Once more he was going to begin in a new land, and a land
where hard craft was as nothing beside clean hands. Not that old Larry
had ever exacted more than his due; but he had stood flat-footed for
that, in spite of prayers and tears; and the reckoning was now at hand.

The door had been opened for young Larry by a stout, heavy-browed man,
dressed in decent black; and as he stood aside for the youth to pass
him in the narrow entry, he showed his discoloured teeth in a sneer.

So ye have hurried here at wanst, eh? said he. Divil the foot have
yez iver put in the house afore, Larry?

Its manners to wait till yer asked, returned Larry gruffly.

The stout man closed the door. The house was soundless, and there was
a heavy smell of sickness; the door of the sitting room stood partly
open, and Larry caught the rustle of skirts.

I knowed yezed come, continued the man who had admitted him. Ah,
but its the sharp wan yez are, Larry.

The youth turned and grasped the door knob. I knowed how itd be,
snarled he, looking savagely over his shoulder at the stout man. Ill
lick youse for this, Kelly!

He jerked open the door and was about to depart when a womans voice
called:

Mr. Murphy! A girl had come into the entry from the sitting room; she
was tall and slim; a bright spot burned in each cheek and she coughed
slightly as the draft from the open door struck her. She held out her
hand.

Im glad that youve come, said she. Your grandfather has been
asking for you again. Were you going away?

Yes, said Larry. He closed the door and took the proffered hand,
ashamed of the anger which Kelly had awakened. She looked into his face
with quiet, candid eyes.

That was wrong, she said. He is very low; will you come up?

He silently followed her up stairs. Kelly entered the sitting room
and stood by the window; his heavy brows were bent and his lips were
muttering. The people were streaming back from the church, across the
railroad; the sooty shifting engine was still making up its train,
panting and whistling like some asthmatic animal; a priestly-looking
young man paused at the door of the house and looked up at the number.

Father Dawson, muttered Kelly hurrying to open the door. He tuk his
toime comin, faith.

The sick man, parchment-faced and wasted by disease, lay upon his bed;
his lips were moving, and his gaunt hands clutched the ivory crucifix.
The wax candles burned upon a table; beside them stood a glass bowl of
water blessed at Easter time; a bisque image of the Virgin stood upon a
shelf, and Rosie OHara knelt before it, her head bent, her eyes fixed
upon the floor. Young Kerrigan sat beside the bed, reading a newly
written paper; the sun slanted in between the partly closed blinds and
lay like a bar of gold upon the floor.

You have stated your wishes very clearly, Mr. Murphy, said the
attorney, and I see nothing that should be changed.

The old man opened his eyes and tried to sit up. Mary! said he.
Wheres Mary?

Here, Uncle Larry. The girl knelt beside him and smoothed his pillow.
You must lie still, said she, gently.

Ye will be a witness till me mark, said he, faintly, an so must
Rosie. Is she here?

Yes Uncle, shes here.

The sight do be lavin me. An the by? Did he say hed come, Mary?
