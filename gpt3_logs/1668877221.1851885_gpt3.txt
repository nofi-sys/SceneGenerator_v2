SCENE:
I

CONCERNING THE VILLAGE OF MALFORD


YOUR idea, said John meditatively, as far as I can elucidate it from
your somewhat wordy discourse, is that I should accompany you to this
exceedingly out-of-the-way, this on your own showing entirely remote,
secluded, and sequestered spot, for the sole purpose of affording you
amusement in your so to speak out of work hours.

That, returned Corin admiringly, is the idea _in toto_. It is
marvellous with what ease and skill you have grasped and summed up the
entire situation.

John sighed.

And might one be allowed to question what are the advantages to be
gained from such a sojourn? What manner of recreation can the place
afford? In a word, where do I come in?

Advantages! Corin raised his eyes to the cobwebby rafters. Heavens
above! Isnt my companionship an advantage? And for recreation what
more can you desire than the contemplation of country lanes and wide
moorland this glorious summer weather? Think of it, man! The earth
ablaze with purple heather, the sea blue and golden,--breathing,
living, colour. Anon there will be blackberries, great luscious
clusters of blue-black fruit hanging ready for the plucking in every
hedgerow. Again, I ask, what more can you desire?

John smiled grimly.

I am not, I would have you observe, either an artist or a boy. Your
inducements fail to move me.

My companionship, urged Corin.

The blatant conceit of the man, sighed John.

Corin changed his tone, descended to wheedling. Consider my
loneliness, he remarked pathetically. From six oclock--I cant put
in more than an eight-hour day--till midnight alone and unoccupied. Six
hours!

Go to bed at nine and reduce the six hours by a simple process
of subtraction to three, or play patience, returned John
unsympathetically.

Inhuman brute, mourned Corin.

John merely laughed.

He was a tall young man, thirty or thereabouts, clean-shaven, bronzed,
grey-eyed, and with a thin hooked nose. His mouth, below it, was
slightly grim in repose. But, when he smiled, you forgot the grimness,
and smiled involuntarily in response. Also, you found yourself watching
for the smile to come into play a second time. It had a curious manner
of leaping first to his eyes in a sudden and illuminating flash.
Deserting them, it passed equally suddenly to his mouth, leaving the
eyes sad. It was a disconcerting trick, a baffling magicians trick,
and left you wondering. In the matter of dress he was fastidious to
a degree. At the moment his attire was the most immaculate suit of
London clothes, grey trousers, frock coat, and all the rest of the
paraphernalia. His silk hat, exceeding glossy, reposed on a worm-eaten
oak chair near him. He had removed a pile of sketch books and a bunch
of dilapidated lilies to make place for the hat. They lay now on the
floor.

With Corin, by contrast, clothes were a matter of necessity as mere
covering, and no more. His tweed trousers and Norfolk jacket had an
out-all-night-in-the-wet-and-then-sat-upon air. In two words they
looked loosely crumpled. Paint spots adorned the left sleeve, in
the crook of the elbow where his palette was wont to rest. His soft
collar, attached to his shirt, was unbuttoned, and merely held together
by a smoke-grey tie. Briefly, in the matter of clothes, he was the
prototype of the modern novelists art-student,--the type that emerges
paint-stained, careless-clad, cheerfully Bohemian, from the chapters of
such novels as deal with the art world in Chelsea.

But here it behoves me to walk warily lest I should hear a whisper of
glass houses, for does not this very Corin himself dwell in that most
fascinating region of London? Is not his studio within a bare five
minutes of the dirty, muddy, grey, but wholly adorable Thames, where
it drifts past Carlyles statue, smoke-grimed and weather-worn, and on
past the old herbalists garden set back across the street?

In face, this same Corin was plump, smooth-skinned, rosy-cheeked,
fair-haired, with short-sighted blue eyes that gazed at you kindly from
behind gold-rimmed spectacles. His own appearance caused him moments
of acute anguish.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

John and Corin are discussing Corin's proposal that John accompany him to the village of Malford. John is uninterested in the idea, finding it difficult to see what advantages there could be in doing so. Corin tries to convince John by appealing to his sense of companionship and by describing the beauty of the countryside. John remains unconvinced, but Corin continues to try to persuade him.
 eventually John relents and agrees to go with Corin to Malford. They pack their belongings and set off on their journey.
Upon arrival in Malford, they find the village to be deserted. There are no signs of life anywhere. They explore the village and find that all the houses are in disrepair. It seems that the village has been abandoned for some time.
As they are exploring, they hear a noise coming from one of the houses. They investigate and find a woman inside, who is surprised to see them. She tells them that she is the only person left in the village. Everyone else left years ago.
The woman, who is the caretaker of the village, tells them that the village is owned by a man who lives in the city and has no interest in it. She says that she stays there to take care of the houses and to keep the village from being completely abandoned.
John and Corin decide to stay in the village for a while and help the woman with her work. They spend their days exploring the village and the surrounding countryside. They also help the woman with her chores, such as cleaning and repairing the houses.
After a few weeks, John and Corin have grown to love the village and its peace and quiet. They have also grown to care for the woman, who has become like a mother to them.
One day, they hear a noise in the distance. They investigate and find that a group of people are coming to the village. The woman tells them that these are the villagers who left years ago. They have come back to visit her.
John and Corin are surprised to see the villagers. They had thought that the village was completely abandoned. The villagers tell them that they left because they were tired of the city and wanted to live in a place where they could be close to nature.
The villagers stay for a few days and then leave. John and Corin are sad to see them go, but they are happy to have had the chance to meet them.
John and Corin continue to live in the village for some time. They eventually get married and have children. They live happily ever after in the village of Malford.
