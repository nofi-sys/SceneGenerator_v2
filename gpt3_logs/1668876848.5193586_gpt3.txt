SCENE:
Love to! Weve got a week yet and you ought to be able to get a lot
of practice in a week. Thats settled, then. But we mustnt forget
theerthe social side of the campaign. So lets see. Jimmy
bent over his list again. Quinn, check. Milfordhad him before.

The second visit to Hugh Ordways study came off right on schedule,
nine days after the first call, but on this occasion Dud and Jimmy
found the room jammed from door to windows with fellows and a loud
and even violent argument going on. Their appearance went practically
unnoticed and they found seats with some difficulty and became for a
while silent listeners. The argument proved to be concerned with the
election the evening before of one Starling Meyer as captain of the
Hockey Team. The hockey team had just finished a disastrous season,
ending with a second defeat by Graftons ancient rival, Mount Morris.
Lack of hard ice had aided in the teams demoralization, but besides
that things had gone badly from start to finish, and there were many
who credited the afore-mentioned Meyer with having been largely to
blame. Pop Driver, who played right guard on the eleven and was
normally good-natured to a fault, expressed the views of the anti-Meyer
faction.

Meyer, Pop was saying, has caused more trouble all the winter than
hes worth. Everything that Yetters wanted to do one way, Stars
insisted on doing another. You fellows know that, all of you. Look at
the way they changed the style of play in the middle of the season.
Yetter started out playing four men on defense and it worked all right.
Then Star got to saying that we werent scoring enough points and
that the four-men-back business was all wrong. He grouched and sulked
about it until Yetter gave in to him. After that we got licked right
along, with one or two exceptions, and finally Yetter went back to the
old style again, and Star threatened to quit and there was the dickens
to pay for awhile. Stars simply no use unless he can be the whole
shooting-match.

Well, theyve made him captain, said Jim Quinn, football manager, so
now he can show what he knows.

Theres no sense in blaming everything on Star Meyer, declared Ned
Musgrave. Yetters a good chap, but he hadnt any business being
captain. Theres where the whole trouble began. If Yetter

Warren would have been all right, said Bert Winslow, if Star had
let him alone. But Star hates to see anyone else have any say about
anything. Hes a peach of a hockey player, Ill grant you that, but
hes a peach of a trouble-maker, too. And Ill bet you anything things
will be in a worse mess next year than they were this.

Why didnt they elect Gus Weston? asked Roy Dresser. Gus would have
made a dandy leader.

Because Star pulled all the strings he could, answered Pop, and
scared the fellows into voting for him.

I happen to know, Pop, interposed Musgrave warmly, that more than
three-fourths of the team wanted Star for captain long before election.
You might as well be fair to him, Pop. Give him a show. Dont convict a
fellow before hes tried, I say!

All right, Ned, answered Pop good-naturedly. Well let him have his
trial. Maybe youre right, too. Star may make a better captain than he
did a first lieutenant. Lets hope so. I wont be here to see, though.

What makes you think so? inquired Nick Blake maliciously, raising a
laugh at Drivers expense. Pop, as he himself put it, was doing the
four-year course in five, and there was always some doubt as to his
getting through in five. Pop grinned now and shook his head.

Theyll give me my diploma to get rid of me, Nick, he said.

Jimmy, who had remained quiescent until now, took advantage of a
momentary lull in the discussion and chuckled. Pop, beside him, turned
inquiringly. Whats on your mind, Jimmy? he inquired.

I was just thinking of something Dud got off awhile ago, replied
Jimmy, still visibly amused. Dud threw an entreating look at him, but
Jimmy pretended not to see it.

Dud who? asked Pop.

Dud Baker, over here. Jimmys glance indicated his friend. We
were talking about the hockey team losing so many games one day and
Dud said he guessed the trouble with themJimmy had managed to
gain the attention of the room by nowwas that they were weak from
Star-vation!

Dud looked anything but like the author of the bonmot at that moment,
but the audience laughed, even Ned Musgrave, and Jimmy credited himself
with a bulls-eye.
