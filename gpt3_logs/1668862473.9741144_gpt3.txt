SCENE:
My friendt, I make more at Virginia.

Well, you know your business better than I do. Hope we get through
without trouble.

Trouble? Vat kind of trouble?

Injuns on warpath. They shot up my brother. Im taking him up with me
to a doctor. From the way the Piutes were heading I rather expect an
attack on the stage to-morrow.

The peddler rose to the bait, excitedly, with shrill voice. And I haf
paid my fare to Virginia. Its an outrage. I vill demand a refund. I
vill sue the company. I vill nodt travel in onsavety. You are right, my
friendt. I sell my stock right here in Carson if I get a refund.

I would, agreed McClintock sympathetically, I know Baldy Green. Lets
see if hell stand for the refund.

The stage driver played up to his friend with a serious face. It was not
customary to make refunds. He had a kind of hunch the stage would get
through without being attacked. But if the gentleman wanted to stay at
Carson and if McClintock would guarantee him against loss to the company
through an empty seat, probably it could be arranged. Incidentally, he
mentioned that he had just heard from the clergyman cancelling his
passage. He had been urged by a deputation of Carson citizens to stay in
town over Sunday and preach on the plaza. This call, he felt, could not
be ignored.

Baldy called Scot back as he was leaving. The stage drivers face was
one wrinkled grin. You cetainly take the cake, old alkali. I got to
give it to you. Afraid the stage will be attacked, are you? Dad gum yore
hide, you know Injuns wont dare come up here on the peck.

Id hate to have the jewellery gentleman take any chances, Scot
explained.

And preachin on the plaza. Dont you know theres hawss racin here
every Sunday? cackled Baldy.

Competition is the life of trade. The ladies can meet an pray for
their wicked husbands. They need it, dont they?

Sure do. Well, I got no kick comin. I wont be here Sunday.

Neither was Scot. He and his brother travelled Virginiaward in the
morning. The mud-wagon had been left at Carson. They travelled in a
beautiful painted Concord stage behind six high-stepping chestnuts
decked with ivory rings, silver tassels, and expensive harness.

Baldy drove superbly. He and his kind were knights of the road. The
wranglers and attendants were deferential to them, the public viewed
them admiringly as celebrities. Baldy drew on his gauntlets slowly,
mounted to the box, and took the ribbons from the hand of a hostler.
There was a swift tightening of the reins, a sweeping crack of the whip.
The leaders came round on the run, the swings at a gallop, and the
wheelers at a trot.

The ride to Virginia was one worth taking. The road wound round curves,
dropped into draws, swept along dugways beneath which were deep
precipices. When he hit the curves Baldy gave the wheels play.
Occasionally one of the back ones hung precariously over space. A minute
later the stage perhaps had struck a level and the driver was riding the
brakes while the horses dashed wildly forward. Ten miles an hour, up
hill and down, over the precipitous mountain road, the chestnuts
travelled wildly, every foot of the way guided by the man on the box who
handled them coolly and expertly. Meanwhile, Baldy discussed casually
with Scot McClintock the news of the day. With his whip he pointed to a
bad turn.

Hank Monk went over the grade yesterdaycoach, hawsses, and
passengers.

Much damage?

Nopenone a-tall. Nary a beast skinned. Paint on coach hardly
scratched. Busted one tenderfoots laig. Thats all. Mighty lucky spill.
Hank always did fall on his feet. Been me Id probly a-hurted one of
the animals.

Lucky for all parties except the tenderfoot, agreed Scot.

Yep. Couldnt a-been better. Glang!

The long whip snaked out with a crack like the sound of an exploding
gun. The coach leaped forward, swaying like a cradle set on wheels. They
were drawing close to Virginia now, and the whole desert was staked like
the sole of a giant shoe. American Flat fell away to the rear. The
chestnuts raced up Gold Hill and the Ophir Grade, across the divide, and
down into Virginia City, which was perched on the lower slope of Mt.
Davidson.
