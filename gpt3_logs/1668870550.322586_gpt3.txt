SCENE:
WEARY horses dragged ponderous trucks homeward; the drivers drooped
upon their high seats and thought of cans of beer; a red sun threw
shafts of light along the cross-town streets and between the rows of
black warehouses.

The porters had all gone for the night from Mason & Sons, and young
Mason stood upon the office step, about to lock the door, when Kerrigan
jumped from a passing car and hailed him.

I just happened to notice you as I was going by, Kerrigan said; and
that reminded me that I wanted to speak to you.

Come in and sit down, said Mason, leading the way into the office.

I drew up a will the other day in which you were named as executor,
said Kerrigan, mounting a stool at the bookkeepers desk.

Mason looked at him questioningly.

Its old Miss Cassidy who kept house for your father, years ago. She
said that she had not spoken to you about the matter, but that she felt
sure that you would consent to act.

Shes a queer old soul, smiled Mason.

No queerer than the will she had me make for her. Quite a tidy sum of
money, too.

She was very saving; and then father thought well of her and advised
her about small investments which were successful. But what induced her
to make a will? Is she ill?

She says she is getting old, and thought that the matter should be
settled. By the way, Mason, there are rumours going about the City
Hall that must interest a reformer like you, and Kerrigan smiled at
his friend. The Motor Traction Company is endeavouring to secure
possession of Center and Line streets.

Do they contemplate purchasing the rights of the new company?

Not while theres a chance to steal them; and from what Ive heard
during the last few days that has been their object since the time the
injunction was granted against the rival concern.

The young attorney planted his back against the desk and braced himself
with his elbows. Let me give you a sketch of the thing, said he. The
City Railway Company was duly chartered, secured the franchise from
councils for these two streets and spent thousands of good dollars in
putting down road-bed, rails and all that sort of thing. At this stage
the Motor Company suddenly discovered that Center and Line streets were
arteries that would tap the thickly populated sections, and that the
new company would reduce their earnings.

Under cover of a protest from citizens living along the line of the
new road, an injunction was gotten out staying all work; the matter was
carried into the courts, where it has been hanging fire ever since.

But, put in Mason, a decision was rendered in favour of the City
Company less than a week ago.

I know that; and in that decision the new move of the Motor people
had its birth. The long delay, the cost of fighting the case and all
that, pretty well drained the resources of the City people, who were
none too rich to begin with. And a time limit was put upon the building
of the line at the time the franchise was granted. The time specified
will shortly expire and the road is but half built. The Motor Company
intends to put unlimited money into the next local election in order to
elect a majority in both branches of councils favourable to revoking
the franchise on the ground of failure to live up to their contract.

Why, this is infamous! exclaimed Mason. How could the road be built
in the time specified when the courts prevented their working upon it?

Kerrigan shrugged his shoulders. The Motor Company want that franchise
and it is not at all particular about how it is gotten.

The two young men rose and made their way to the sidewalk.

I understand, said Mason, as he sprang the catch of the office door,
when the new company was organized that the stock was mostly taken
up in small lots by small store-keepers and people with accounts in
saving banks.

Thats true, answered Kerrigan; and thats what makes the company
easy game.

A heavy team swung up to the curb and a square-jawed young fellow
climbed down from his seat. A battered, drink-sodden man tremulously
clutched him by the arm and began mumbling incoherently. The teamster
slipped him a nickel and gave him a helpful shove down the street; then
he approached and said to Mason:
