SCENE:
But I have nowhere to go and no one to go with except, of course,
Harry, Annie added, hastily.

You have got over the silly stage of newly-married life very soon,
said Lilian, amused, but rather surprised. Now I want to go to a
hundred places I cant go to. Aunt Constantia looks down at my black
gown and says, Too soon, my dear, too soon! And she and mamma both
disapprove of all the persons I like. I never was so wretched in my
life--just when I am in mourning too, and want cheering dreadfully!

Well, you will soon be able to go out more, and then you will
certainly leave off envying my quiet life.

Oh, but there will be far worse trials for me then! Now that we are in
mourning, at least no one can find fault with my dress; but, when we
begin to go out again--and I am to be presented next season--I shall
want money; and George is so mean--he says he is so poor, but that is
nonsense!--that I know he will open his eyes and say that a hundred a
year ought to buy me everything I want, and the same day he will send a
groom up to Tattersalls to buy him a couple of hunters, and wonder at
the selfish extravagance of women! It is so silly, too; for the very
best thing he can do is to get me well married as soon as possible;
and who will see me if I never go out, and who will look at me if I am
dressed with tasteful economy? As if economy was ever tasteful--as if
I did not do my dressmaker credit, too! I assure you I look quite nice
when I am well-dressed.

She threw back her graceful head and smiled at Annie with playful
insolence, which was charming in such a beautiful girl; and, having
got, for a time, to the end of her grievances, she gave a plaintive
sigh, and then laughed at herself.

I have been taking the privileges of a relative in boring you to
death; but really my wrongs were getting too heavy to be borne in
silence. It is very good of you to listen without yawning.

Oh, you dont know how glad I am to see you and listen to you! I was
afraid you would be so angry about Harrys marrying me.

I wont pretend we were glad to hear of it; but everything else was
swallowed up in papas death. I dont think mamma has quite forgiven
either of you yet; but she will come round in time. And, you see, as I
told her, if Harry hadnt married you, George would have done so.

Annie started, and the color rushed to her face.

Oh, you need not look surprised! I am sure of it. He was much more in
love with you than Harry was; and, to tell you the truth, when you had
left Garstone, and nobody could tell what had become of you, I thought
George was more likely than Harry to know where you were.

She rattled on without taking much notice of Annies continued
agitation. After a minutes pause for breath, she added:

And I did credit to your being a good little thing and a clever little
thing, for George has far fewer scruples and far less sense of honor
than even Harry, I can tell you. Harry is not a bad fellow at heart,
though he is such a lout; there is no other word for him. Will you
forgive my frankness? I am a pretty good judge of my brothers, and my
knowledge may be useful to you.

She rose from the sofa and took Annies trembling hand.

I have frightened you, worried you. You wont let me come again. But
you will, wont you? she added, in a coaxing tone--for I am so dull.
May I come on Thursday, the day after to-morrow, and we will go to the
Academy together? It will soon close now, so it will be full of country
bumpkins; but I will brave them, if you will. Mamma and Aunt Constantia
find it too tiring for them. May I come?

She asked quite restlessly and anxiously; and Annie, surprised, begged
her to come, and promised to be ready at whatever time she pleased.

When Harry returned home, and his wife told him of his sisters visit,
he was even more surprised than she had been.

Well, she is a queer girl; but I think this beats any freak she has
had yet, he said. You should just have heard her go on at me--and
at you--at Garstone, when she first heard about it--just after our
fathers death too. I told her if she didnt hold her tongue, I would
turn her out of the room. And presently he broke out again, I wonder
what she is up to now?

Without suspecting any deep-laid plot under Lilians friendliness,
as her husband seemed to do, Annie was more surprised than ever
when Thursday came and Miss Braithwaite drove up in a hansom very
punctually, to see how excited she seemed to be over such a simple
diversion as a visit to the Academy with her sister-in-law. She was
looking radiantly lovely. The mourning, which did not at all set off
Annies brunette beauty, was the most perfect setting possible for
Lilians bright, fair complexion and chestnut-brown hair. She was in
good spirits too, and so anxious to start that she gave Annie doubtful
help in dressing with her own hands. Then they got into the hansom
which was waiting outside, and were at Burlington House in five minutes.
