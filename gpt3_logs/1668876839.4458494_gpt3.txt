SCENE:
III

29 LOTHROP


True to his promiseor threat, if you think with DudJimmy haled his
protesting friend from room to room in the evenings, made him join
the throngs on the ice or the toboggan slide in the afternoons and on
all occasions dragged him into the conversations and, to use his own
expression, got him in the spot-light. It cant be truthfully said
that his efforts met with overwhelming success, however. Dud didnt
shine as a conversationalist or display any traits calculated to win
popularity. No one disliked him in the least. Most of the time few were
really conscious of his presence, in spite of Jimmys untiring efforts.
Personally, as has been suggested, Dud didnt take kindly to being
exhibited and exploited, and when a fortnight or so after the inception
of the undertaking Jimmy actually got to telling jokes and crediting
them to Dud, the latter was supremely uncomfortable. Jimmy would
chuckle and say: Dud got off a good one the other day, fellows. And
then he would follow with some more or less brilliant remark or joke
that sounded to Dud horribly flat. Generally the hearers laughed and
shot surprised glances at the silent and embarrassed Dud, but he didnt
win recognition as a wit or a sage for all of that. Had they heard the
things from Dud first-hand they might have been more impressed. As it
was the credit went rather to Jimmy than Dud.

Jimmy played Boswell to Duds Doctor Johnson with remarkable enthusiasm
and patience. He evolved all sorts of schemes, most of which his chum
promptly refused to consider, designed to waft Dud into the white light
of publicity. For instance, he conceived the brilliant idea of having
Dud write a notable article for _The Campus_, the school monthly. Dud
had no serious objection to that project, but it fell through because
neither of them could think of a subject to write on. Then Jimmy
suggested that Dud get someone to break through the ice on the river
so Dud could rescue him. Jimmy said he would be glad to impersonate
the drowning character if he wasnt afraid of catching cold and having
rheumatism in his throwing arm. It was all highly entertaining for
Jimmy and he thoroughly enjoyed it, but Dud was getting very tired
of it. Every now and then Jimmy had what he called a show down. At
such times he would take a list from his drawer in the study table and
check off the names of fellows whose acquaintance Dud had succeeded in
making since the last time.

Churchill, we got him. Check for Churchill. He was a brand new one,
wasnt he? Roy Dresser, check. Dresser was rather a success, Dud. I
think he rather took to you. We must call there again. Ill make a note
of that. Dressers room is a good place to meet fellows. Parker, check.
Parkers an ass, anyway. AyerI say, Dud, we havent met Neil Ayer
yet. Do you know him at all?

Only to speak to.

Well go after Ayer this evening, then. I know where to find him. He
will be in Joe Leslies room, I guess. Foster Tray, check. Trays a
good sort. Zanettithats another chap weve missed. Well have to
find him with Nate Leddy some time. I dont know him at all. Hes a
good fellow to know, though. Stands in with the football and the track
crowds. I tell you what, Dud! Why not go out for the Track Team?

Because I cant do anything, laughed Dud.

How do you know you cant? asked Jimmy, untroubled. Besides,
you wouldnt have to really _do_ anything. You could have a try at
something and youd meet a lot of fellows. Jumping isnt awfully hard.
Why not try the broad jump?

I couldnt do that and pitch too, you idiot.

Thats so. I forgot. Still, some fellows do go in for baseball and
track. Theres Cherry, for instance. Well, never mind. Maybe wed
bettererconcentrate. Jimmy sat back and studied Dud speculatively,
tapping his pen against his teeth the while. What weve got to do,
Dud, he continued presently, in the tones of one who has reached a
weighty conclusion after much thought, is to put it all over those
other box artists. Thats our line, Dud. Weve got to spring you as a
startling phenom! Yes, sir, thats the game!

Thats all well enough, Jimmy, but suppose I cant pitch a little bit
when the time comes?

By Ginger, youve got to! Look here, youre wasting time. You ought
to be at it every day. You ought to get down in the cage in the gym
and practice. What time is it now? Nearly six, eh? Too late today,
then. But tomorrow well put in a half-hour, and the next day, too, and
right along until they call candidates. Ill catch you. Ill borrow a
mitt somewhere. Itll be good fun, too. Practice for both of us. Great
scheme, eh?

Do you mind? asked Dud eagerly.
