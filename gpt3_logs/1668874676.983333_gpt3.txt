SCENE:
But Harry, nerved by the danger of losing Fire King, had strung himself
up to do great things. Fate favored him.

It was Saturday; and on that day the vicars children always had a half
holiday, and their governess was free to spend the afternoon as she
liked. When it was fine she generally used her liberty to enjoy her one
chance in the week of a walk by herself, and with a book--some solidly
instructive book in her hand, just to justify her ramble to herself and
relieve her conscience of the reproach of wasting her time. So on
this Saturday afternoon she had strolled out with a sketch-book and a
small camp-stool, and, after wandering through the fields alongside the
hedges, watching the young rabbits playing about their holes, gathering
a few late primroses, singing to herself all the while very happily,
she opened her camp-stool in the corner of a field where there was a
pond half surrounded by trees, seated herself, and began to draw.

On the other side of the pond, divided from it by a stretch of uneven
grass-covered ground, ran a private road, and beyond that was a thick
plantation from which, unknown to her, Harry had for some time been
watching the governess; and further along the road were some stables
and outbuildings, in the shelter of which his brother George had been
for some time watching Harry.

Miss Lane set to work with the dry enthusiasm of the conscientious
amateur, and was soon too much absorbed in calculating distances and
making little dots on the paper with her pencil to notice Harry, until,
by making a long circuit through the plantation, across the road and
along the edge of the field she was in, he came through the long grass
to her side. Filled with the guilty consciousness of the enterprise he
had in hand, he was half sheepish, half bold, and Miss Lanes greeting,
which was a rather cold little bow and a complete ignoring of his
proffered hand, did not help him to recover his self-possession.

You are drawing, I see, he remarked, rather huskily.

Yes, said she. Then, as there was a pause which her companion
evidently did not know how to fill, she added, glancing first at her
paper, and then at the pond in front of her, It doesnt look much like
it yet, does it?

I dare say it will look more like when it is finished.

No, it wont, said Miss Lane, candidly; that is the worst of it. I
cant draw, though I really do try very hard.

Then why do you give yourself all the trouble of trying?

Harry felt that his share in the talk was not in the style he had
intended, but her rather stiff simplicity of manner disconcerted him.

It is an excuse for coming out of doors.

An excuse? I never want one. I only want excuses for not coming home.
I hate houses--they are so beastly stuffy; dont you think so?

He felt he was getting further and further from the lover-like manner
which was to overcome Miss Lane; but he could not help it. She
considered a little before answering.

I like houses too--some houses, I wonder you dont like yours. I think
it is one of the nicest I have ever been in.

Do you? Do you like it better than the Vicarage?

Oh, yes! The Vicarage is only a place to eat and drink and sleep in!
she said, scornfully. As for the drawing-room, everything in it is an
insult to ones eyes.

I suppose you mean that it is not artistic, said Harry. But it isnt
the furniture that insults me; it is the people. I feel as if I were in
church, or as if I had had a bucket of cold water over me when I didnt
expect it, directly I get inside the house.

Oh, dont say that! They are all very kind.

Then you like the Vicarage people better than the Grange people?

I did not say that. But I know them better.

Oh, yes; I remember! You said we were a set of brutes.

He felt that this was worse and worse; he was getting positively rude.

I have never said anything of the kind, Mr. Braithwaite, said she,
coldly.

Didnt you tell Stephen that George and I were brutes?

I did say it was brutal to box your sisters ears and knock your
brother down just because they contradicted you; and I think so, said
Miss Lane, quietly.
