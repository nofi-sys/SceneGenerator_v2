SCENE:
XXV


THE KILLER STRIKES

It was generally recognized that the Republicans would carry the state
that year. The war was still so near that it would have a determining
influence on thousands of voters. The chief local interest centred in
the race for the nomination of the dominant party for secretary of
state.

This was due to several factors. Chief of these was the fight between
two candidates of outstanding personality, a fight which rapidly
developed into a bitter one. Scot McClintock was still the most
picturesque figure in Nevada, though he had left behind him his wild
escapades and his gay irresponsibility. The mining camps were yet full
of the rumour of his adventures. In any assembly his good looks, charm,
and qualities of leadership made him a marked figure. His audacity and
courage fitted the time and the place. Men tremendously admired him
because they saw in him what they would like to be themselves.

The character of Ralph Dodson made no appeal to mens affections. He was
too cold and calculating, his ambition too ruthless. But they recognized
his strength. He would travel a long way in the world.

The big mining interests supported Dodson. Scot was too much a tribune
of the people to suit them. At any time he might embarrass the mine
owners by some quixotic gesture inspired by his sense of justice.

Scot went out into the camps and the agricultural valleys to make a
personal campaign. If he had been dealing with the voters individually
he could have made a runaway race of it. But delegates to conventions,
then as now, were under the influence of leaders, who in turn took
orders from the men who financed the campaign. He was under a tremendous
handicap because he had only an individual following to oppose a party
machine.

Yet he made headway, and so fast that his opponent became alarmed.
Dodson came out in the _Enterprise_ with a savage attack on his rival in
which he accused him of being an ex-gambler and a bawdy-house brawler.
Scot kept his temper and made no counter charges. From the stump he
replied that at least he had always been a square gambler. His fighting
record, he said carelessly, must take care of itself.

Vicky met Ralph Dodson on the Avenue at Piodie while the campaign was at
its height. She fired point blank a charge at him.

I read what you said in the _Enterprise_ about Scot.

He laughed a little, but his eyes watched her warily. Youd think once
in a while some newspaper reporter would get a story right, he said
easily.

Oh! Wasnt it true that you said it? Her level gaze met his steadily.

I was annoyed, and I said something. Dont remember just what.
Certainly I didnt intend to insult any of your family.

Then youll deny it in the paper?

Is it quite worth-while? Everybody knows what newspapers arehow
theyre keen to make everything one says sensational.

If you dont deny it people will think you said it.

We-ell, in a political campaign men get excited. It doesnt greatly
matter what folks sayjust part of the game, you know.

Is it part of the game to tell lies about a good man? she asked
flatly.

He threw up his hands gaily. I surrender at discretion. Will a note to
the _Enterprise_ correcting the error suit your Majesty?

Youre not doing it for me, she told him, her dark eyes shining.
Youre doing it because its the fair thing.

Hang the fair thing, he answered, laughing. Im doing it for Miss
Victoria Lowell.

Id rather you didnt. She dimpled to a smile. Because Im against
you and for Scot in this fight.

Then Ill give up the race, he mocked. I think you ought at least to
be neutral.

Dodson played his hand under cover after that. He saw that McClintock
was kept under a steady fire of newspaper attack and that none of it
could be traced to him. No paper dared make any reference to the origin
of the trouble between Colonel McClintock and the Dodsons, but hired
assassins of reputation whispered evil stories in which the names of
Mollie and Scot appeared. These became so numerous that at last Scot in
a speech full of eloquence and fierce indignation referred to the
traducers of his wife as snakes in the grass who dared not come into the
open for fear of having the life trampled out of them.
