Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
OHara, a pot-bellied man, bald, broad-faced and with hard little eyes,
walked back to the kitchen.

We wur talkin av owld Jimmie Larkin, said Bridget putting the
crockery upon the table. Look till the sup av coffee, Ellen, she
whispered, hurriedly, dye not see that its bilin over!

OHara glowered at them, angrily.

An its only startin yez are! he cried. Dye si here like a pair
av owld cacklin hens, an the bell just rung for Mass!

The bell had just ceased and people were still hurrying on; the red sun
peeped at them from behind the church tower; the hands of the big clock
reproachfully pointed out the fact that they were late. Bridget glanced
through the side window.

There goes Clancys wife in her new silk, said she. Its proud
enough shes gettin till be, since her husband opened the grocery.

May the divil fly away wid Clancys wife an her silks as well! Faix
an there do be other things that Clancy could do wid his money!
OHara was in a stormy mood.

Sit down till yez bit av breakfast, soothed Ellen. Clancy do be
doin well an will pay the money he borried av ye, Malachi. Its drink
yez coffee black yezll have till, she added, for young McGonagle
have not come wid the milk yet.

He sat down with a crabbed laugh.

McGonagle is it! exclaimed he. Faith an theres another wan. The
toime is drawin on, so it is, but divil the dollar richer is he. Its
wait for me bit av money hell be wantin me till, but scure till the
day will I. Ill sell him out, the spalpeen! He do not trate me wid
rayspect.

A rattling of wheels ceased at the door, and it shook under a
thundering hand.

Spake av the divil! remarked Ellen. She took a pitcher from the table
and opened the door. A pint, she said.

The youth with the milk-pail dexterously dipped out the required
quantity.

Heard the news? inquired he.

Weve heerd nothin, returned Ellen, barrin that Hogan as he passed
on his bate this mornin, towld uz that his by Tom wur near kilt las
noight at yez blagard club.

Ah, Hogans daffy! I meant did ye hear about old man Murphy a-dyin?

What! exclaimed OHara, his mouth full, is owld Larry cold, thin?

Not yet; but hell die before the days over. And with this the
milkman threw himself and can into the wagon at the curb, and rolled
down the street. Ellen closed the door and put the pitcher upon the
table.

So hell be goin at las, said she.

Small wonder, put in the sister; sure hes been poorly this long
time.

The owld man made a tidy bit av money in his day, said the brother,
admiringly. Bud, with a sigh, its lavin it all hell be.

An tell me, Malachi, said Bridget, dyez think the gransonll git
any av it?

OHara spilled some of the milk into his coffee.

Divil a cint, answered he, positively. Sure, the owld man have
niver noticed him since the day he wur born. An small blame till him,
rapping upon the table with his spoon, for what call had his son till
take up wid a Jewess?

But, reasoned Ellen, now that he do be dyin he might call him in
an--

Sorra the fear av that! Faix an whin Mike lay dead at OConnors, the
undertaker, he wint naythur nixt nor near him. Some say Kelly wur the
cause av that, but owld Larry had timper enough av his own, God knows.

An do ye tink hell lave the property till the Church?

Ayther that or till Mary Carroll. Kelly tinks there do be a chance
for his boy, Martin; but Martins a hard drinker an the owld man niver
liked a bone in his body.
