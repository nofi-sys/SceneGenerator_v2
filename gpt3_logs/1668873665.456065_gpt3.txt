Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
I do not deny that such a thing is possible. I am not prepared to state
absolutely that such things are impossible, but I have never had any
proof sufficient to convince me that they were at all _probable_, and I
dont believe that spirits have anything to do with all this table
rapping, etc., which really amounts to nothing. You will find that all
written answers to questions, even in slate-writing, tell only that
which is known to some one in the room. If a question is asked which
demands an unknown answer the so-called spirit either refuses to speak
or the answer is so ambiguous as to admit of several interpretations.
Really I have never seen one such communication that even stated a fact
clearly. They usually deal in generalities.

That is true. Ive often told Horace that they could get along all
right until some question was asked which the mind-reader could not find
out about, and then they fail. I have heard that only inferior spirits
are capable of producing psychical phenomena.

So we have the Indian children and big medicine-men to instruct us so
much. Strange that people should pin their faith to the utterances of
spirits of those with whom they would not associate were they living
upon earth.

After all, its the making a religion of it that I object to, said
Mrs. Wylie, and letting these communications, wherever evolved, control
ones morals and living.

Did you ever know a person made better by giving up his religion and
substituting spiritism?

No, that is it. I have often told Horace that the doctrine tended to
demoralization; but he will not listen to me. Of course there is much
that is wrong in the followers of any religion, but this seems
especially lowering in its tendency, so far as I have observed.

Well, you can see what it has done for my poor Alice. And her sister
Lissa is nearly insane from it. It will unbalance the mind if not the
moral nature.

I suspect you will not be willing to go and hear Mrs. Lucien when she
comes to C upon her Western tour. I care nothing for the exhibition in
itself, but am a little anxious to know how she has developed. I have
not seen her since she first began to try her mystic powers, as we went
to the Pacific coast soon afterwards.

O, yes, I am willing to see your friend. I am not so intolerant as
that. She may, as I said, be sincere and self-deceived. Such a condition
might be possible. However, it is quite as likely you are deceived in
her. By the way, you have a remarkable maidthis Tibby. She is extremely
pretty and has wonderful eyes.

Ah, you are stricken with a shaft from those eyes. I dont wonder at
it. Tibby has been with me ever since she was fourteen, and I have heard
that remark over and over again from each one to whom I have introduced
her.

I could believe she practises hypnotism, though perhaps unconsciously.

Ah, I have frequently suggested as much to Horace, but he says it is
her beauty. She certainly can do what she wishes with any one. The young
men at the summer hotels where we stop swarm about her like bees about a
honey jar, but she does not seem to care for them. Sometimes she plays
the most absurd tricks upon them. One evening, when we were at the
Metropolitan, a young man called whom I had especially recommended to
Tibby. I left them in the parlor and stepped out upon the veranda.
Shortly, Miss Tibby followed me, her eyes dancing with mischief. Where
is Mr. Bevington, I asked. In the parlor, asleep, she said demurely.
I went in, and sure enough, there the fellow sat in an easy chair, sound
asleep, his jaw dropped, and looking anything but picturesque and
charming. Tibby stood by me, looking wickedly at him.

There, you see how gentlemanly your fine young man is, she said. I
must be interesting company. Dont you pity me? Shall I cover him with a
shawl and let him sleep? I shook my head at her. Better waken him.

Mr. Bevington, well excuse you if you would rather sleep at home,
she said. I wish you could have witnessed his confusion when he awoke,
as he did immediately upon Tibbys addressing him. I really pitied the
poor fellow. He muttered, of course, something about late hours, etc.,
but I am satisfied Tibby had something to do with his sleeping. She has,
when she chooses, a very soothing influence over one.

So I perceive. I saw an instance of her mesmeric power yesterday. She
wanted to go and ride upon Tempest (by the way, there is a proof of her
strength. Tempest was the worst horse on the ranch) and Robbie insisted
upon her staying with him. She sat down upon the horse-block and looked
at the child until he came to her as if she had been leading him by a
rope.

I think you may as well sleep while I am gone, she said, to keep you
out of mischief. To my surprise the little fellow dropped down by the
side of the block and appeared to be asleep in a minute. He slept until
she returned from her ride, when she awakened him, and they both came in
together.
