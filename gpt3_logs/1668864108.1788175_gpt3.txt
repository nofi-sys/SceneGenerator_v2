SCENE:
Bulstrode broke into a great, nervous laugh. _Then_ youd know they
were father and son. To see that little shaver stand up straight and
eye the great Mr. Skelton as coolly as you please--odds my life,
madam, the brat is a gentleman, if I ever saw one! You ought to
see the positive air with which he disclaims any relationship to
Skelton when strangers have asked him about it. That, too, makes
me suspect that he dreads something of the sort. It would be more
natural if he should show a boyish desire to be related to Skelton
and to share his consequence. He has a few books of Pryors and a few
trinkets of Mrs. Pryors, and I dont believe all Skeltons money
could buy those trifling things from him. But this haughty, naturally
self-respecting spirit of the boy only makes Skelton love him the more.
I have predicted to Skelton that the boy will hate him forever if any
disclosure is made about his birth. And Skelton dreads it, too. So you
see, madam, in spite of all he can do--and he will do all that mortal
man can do--you and yours may yet be rich through Skelton.

Elizabeth sat, roused out of her sad patience into trembling
excitement. Of course, it was far off and doubtful, but it was
startling. Bulstrode had not asked her not to mention it to her
husband, nor would she have made any such promise. Presently Bulstrode
rose to go. Elizabeth realised, without his mentioning it, that if
it ever came to Skeltons ears what Bulstrode had that night told,
Deerchase would never harbour him another hour, and she knew it was in
pity for her griefs that he had told her at all. She tried to express
this to Bulstrode, and he comprehended her.

He walked back to Deerchase oppressed with the reaction that follows
excitement. Suddenly, as he trudged along the white and sandy road,
under the pale splendour of the moon, he remembered Skeltons words:
You will not do the boy any harm until your heedless tongue begins to
wag, and then in pure idleness and wantonness you will tell all you
know. Yes, Skelton was right, as usual. He had not told it in idleness
or wantonness, but he had told it. He could fancy Lewiss face if he
had heard what had passed in the Newington drawing-room that night--the
shame, grief, reproach, indignation. Bulstrode sighed, and went heavily
upon his road home.

Mrs. Blair remained sitting in the drawing-room for some hours just
as Bulstrode had left her. The candles burned out and the moonlight
streamed through the open windows and made patches on the polished
floor. A servant went about after a while, shutting the house up, when
Mrs. Blair rose and went to her own room. As she passed Hilarys door
everything was still, and she was afraid to open the door for fear it
might wake him. She found herself unable to go to bed, though, and at
midnight was sitting at her window looking out without seeing anything,
although the moon was not yet gone.

Presently she heard Blair come softly out of Hilarys room and go
downstairs into his own den, which was called by courtesy a study, but
which was littered up with all the impedimenta of a country gentleman.
Sometimes during the night watches, when the boy was sleeping, he would
slip down there for a smoke. Nothing could exceed Blairs tenderness to
his children, and when they were ill their exquisite fondness for him
appeared to redouble.

He had just finished his first cigar when the door opened and Elizabeth
entered with a candle in her hand. She had on a white dressing
wrapper, and her long hair was plaited down her back. Blair knew in an
instant from her face that something strange had happened.

She came forward and seated herself so that her head rested on his
shoulder. Blair at once laid down the cigar he had just lighted. He
did not hesitate to ask her to sign away her rights in everything they
jointly possessed, but he was careful to treat her with every mark of
the most perfect personal respect.

Is Hilary asleep? she asked.

Soundly. He wont wake up until morning. You had a visitor. I heard
Bulstrodes voice downstairs.

Yes, answered Elizabeth.

Blair felt her begin to tremble, and asked her what was the matter.

Only something Mr. Bulstrode told me, she answered, and then rapidly
and excitedly poured it all out. She could always express herself with
remarkable clearness, and Blair had no difficulty in understanding just
how things were.

And, although it will probably never benefit us, said Elizabeth
finally, for Richard Skelton is as likely to live as we are, yet it
may some day benefit our children.

But I dont see why it shouldnt benefit us, said Blair drily.
Nothing is easier than to get a copy of that will, and somebody can be
found who will risk something upon such magnificent chances. I daresay
Skelton himself would be glad to compromise with us for a handsome sum
if we would convey all our interest in the property back to him.
