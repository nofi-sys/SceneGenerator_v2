Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
The excitement upon the beach now boiled to fever heat.  The hills
nearest the bay were soon black with spectators, and in the midst of
this new sensation the casks upon the beach were forgotten by all
except the little man.

Indeed, had he not passed so close leading a Shetland pony very
carefully and yet urging it to its fullest speed, Rob would never
have remembered the landing of that mysterious cargo and consequently
never have been mixed up in the tragedy of gold.  But to Rob there
was something enormously mystifying about the character of this
solitary traveller, with his anxious manner, and the rattling casks
ranged high upon the pony's flanks.  It was like an old wife's tale
of the fairies and their secret kegs of heather ale.

Partly because they were going the same road--partly because his
curiosity was awake--he followed him through the heather, keeping a
sharp eye meanwhile, for again and again the man upon the track would
swing suddenly about and send his gaze ranging the hill-side for fear
of being followed by the people on the shore.  But always he did so
with the utmost haste, urging the pony onwards after each halt, as
though he feared the approach of night, or something that Rob knew
nothing about.

And so they reached Loch Arkaig, and on the shore of the loch the man
seemed to hesitate and take thought, and then hitching the pony to a
tree he conveyed the casks to the sand beside the edge of the
heather, and flinging off his coat, drew a spade from a hidden place
and commenced to dig.

Twilight had come, and so shadowy had the shore grown that Rob crept
nearer, wriggling through the tufts of heather and rock as
noiselessly as an Indian.

Suddenly, however, he saw the head and shoulders of some one else
silhouetted against the grey surface before him, a man who crouched
and ducked his head as the digging ceased or recommenced upon the
beach with the same care that he himself was practising.  It was
evident to Rob that there was more in all of this than he had
imagined.

At last, apparently satisfied, the watcher began to retreat towards
him, running on all fours up the hill-side.  So rapidly did he come,
indeed, that Rob had no time to roll out of the way, and with a swift
bound the newcomer flung his full weight upon him, uttering no sound
whatever, and together they rolled over and over in each other's arms.

One moment Rob was uppermost, then the other, who seemed all arms and
legs and sharp clawing fingers.  Twice Rob felt his throat gripped
and two thumbs upon his windpipe, and each time he managed to jerk
his head away.  Then with a swift dive of his right arm he reached
the knife in his stocking, and pulling it out he plunged it into his
assailant's shoulder.  It was a small blade, ill-fitted for dangerous
work such as this; but a thin scream told him that he had penetrated
the man's thick great-coat.  Then perceiving his opponent jerk his
head about with the pain, Rob clutched a heavy stone and driving it
against his temple sent him senseless upon the ground.

It was a narrow escape, but fortune had apparently come to his aid in
the nick of time.  With a gasp of relief he sprang to his feet, when
out of the darkness a voice said: "Stand, or I fire!" and the cold
barrel of a pistol was rammed against his cheek.

He had forgotten the man upon the shore.

"I am unarmed," gasped Rob; "and it is the man upon the ground whom
you should guard against, not me."

At that the pistol was lowered, and seating himself the newcomer laid
it upon his knee and ordered him to relate his account of the fight,
to which he listened with the closest interest.  Then rising he bound
the unconscious man's arms and legs with some rope which lay upon the
beach, and thrust a rough gag into his mouth.

"And now, my lad," said he, "tell me what brings you here."

With some hesitation Rob related his experiences of the last two
days, and when he had finished his companion clapped him upon the
back.

"Bravely done," he said; "and let me tell you that Archibald Cameron
is proud to meet ye."  So saying he wrung him warmly by the hand and
sprang to his feet.

He was that Dr. Archibald Cameron, brother to Lochiel, who was to
suffer death at the hands of the Government in the year '53, a very
gallant gentleman and the last to fall in the Stuart cause.

The moon was climbing into the sky as they stepped towards their
prisoner; but Cameron first took Rob aside and whispered in his ear:
