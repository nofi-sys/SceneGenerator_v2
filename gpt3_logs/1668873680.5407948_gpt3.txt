SCENE:
Are you strong-willed?

Ah, you answer my question in the Yankee fashion. I suppose I am. My
stepmother used to call me that self-willed, headstrong girl, because
I could coax papa to let me have my own way sometimes. And when I was
right, why should I not have it? The uptilted chin rose higher.

It is usually womans way, Mark replied.

The right way is. I agree with you.

Tibby walked forward with the free, upspringing step of perfect health
and high spirits.

Mr. Cramer, you have not answered my question. What is this power of
hypnotic control?

You should know better than I, Miss Waring. So far as I understand it,
it is the controlling of one persons will and senses by another, the
subject passively submitting to it. I cannot imagine your hypnotizing
me, for I am naturally very positive myself. You might do so if I were
off my guard. Neither have I your power over others. Why, is not clear
to me.

I made you ask a question for me a couple of days ago, Tibby
confessed, laughing.

When? Mark looked surprised.

It was when you and Mrs. McCleary were talking together, and I wanted
to hear her tell about the planchette. So I told you to ask herthat is,
_willed_ you to. And immediately you turned around and said, Well, how
does Mr. McCleary get on with his planchette?

Mark laughed.

I remember I was sorry for starting her off upon her hobby, and was
provoked at myself for asking afterwards, he said. But here we are at
Nathans. Ill take you in and then Ill leave you to entertain Lissa in
your own way.

They found her sitting listlessly by her low window, her hands folded in
her lap, her sad, dark-rimmed eyes full of unshed tears.

I have brought Miss Waring over to keep you company for a while, Mark
said brightly. I think youll get along well together without me, so
Ill run back to Alice. How are you feeling? Better?

Lissa arose and came forward to meet them with extended hands, then her
eyes followed Tibbys about the disordered room. A flush of color came
faintly into her cheeks.

Iam about as usual, thank you, she said to Mark, then apologetically
to Tibby: Neoka has neglected the work to-day. She wanted a holiday and
I let her off, and have not attended to it myself.

Are you not well, Mrs. Bartram? asked Tibby.

Nothat is, I am better than I was, she stammered, looking at Tibby in
an embarrassed way.

You ought to be out in this lovely sunshine. Dont you think so, Mr.
Cramer?

Yes, indeed. Theres life and health in every gleam, thanksgiving to
the sun, misquoted Mark, and he touched his hat and turned away.

I have a headache, began Lissa.

Which I can rid you of in short order, cried Tibby. Did Mrs. Wylie
never tell you what a good doctor I am? I can always cure her headaches
in a moment. May I try upon you?

Mrs. Bartram signified her assent, and Tibby stepped to her side and
began to rub her head, talking the while in her low, rich tones.

You are to stop thinking about anything and let your head rest easily
against the back of the chair. I will take the pain here and carry it
away on the ends of my fingersso. Ah, you are beginning to feel better
already. The pain is going, now almost gonenow it is gone. Isnt it? I
do not think it will trouble you any more.

Lissa smiled. It has gone, she murmured.

Ah, that is lovely. Now we will go and walk. It will complete my cure.
Shall we go down by the river and gather plums?

Lissa assented, and Tibby noticed the brighter look that already
animated her face.
