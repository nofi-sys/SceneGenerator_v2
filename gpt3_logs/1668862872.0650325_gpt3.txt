SCENE:
XXIII


TWO PLUS ONE MAKES THREE

With a swift movement of her supple body Vicky was on her knees beside
the man. She slipped an arm under his head. Icy sleet encrusted his
clothes. It clung in icicles to his hair and eyebrows. It matted his
lashes and small Vandyke beard.

From her throat came an astonished little cry of recognition. The man
was Hugh McClintock. Over her shoulder she called to the big man at the
table.

Bring me whisky and waterplease.

He brought it, then closed the door. Awkwardly he stood above her.

Had a hellv a close call, he growled sulkily. It did not suit him to
entertain a second guest.

Vicky let the whisky drop between the lips. Presently Hugh opened his
eyes. He smiled feebly at her. Surprise wiped out the smile. Little
Vicky, he murmured.

Ump-hu, she nodded. Then, to the hulking figure behind her, the girl
gave order: Help me carry him nearer the fire. Hes most frozen.

The fellow shambled forward and stooped down. As he did so his eyes fell
on the face of the helpless traveller. He ripped out a savage oath. With
the sweep of an arm he dragged the girl to her feet and hurled her back
to the wall.

His fury struggled for expression. Gotcha. Gotcha good an right. Im
gonna stomp the life outa you. Gona put my heel on yore throat an crack
yore spine. Unerstand?

Victoria knew the ruffian now. A flash of memory carried her back to a
day in her childhood when she had seen a horrible apelike figure
standing over the prostrate body of a man from which life had just been
violently ejected. She saw the same gargoyle face, the same hulking
muscle-bound shoulders and long arms with hairy wrists projecting from
the coat sleeves. Her memory brought her a second picture of the same
incident. A smiling young fellow was lifting her gently from the ground.
His hand was caressing her hair softly as he spoke. She recalled even
his words. Run right along into the wagon where yore dad is, lil girl,
an dont turn yore head.

The girls arm rested on a shelf, in the same position where it had
fallen when she had been hurled back. Her fingers touched something
cold.

You first. Yore brother next, the guttural voice of Dutch went on, and
the horrible malice of it seemed unhuman. I been waitin a mighty long
time, an I gotcha at last. Sure have. Thought I was scared of you an
that damned high-heeled brother o yourn, did you? Me, I was settin
back an waitinwaitin for my chance. An its come, like I knew it
would. Beg. Whine like a papoose. It wont do you no good, but go to it
jest the same. Hear mebefore I turn you over an crack yore backbone
at the neck.

His gloating was horrible. It sent chills through Victorias blood. Her
fingers spasmodically closedon the ivory handle of a revolver. The
force of the recoil had flung her hand into contact with the revolver
Dutch had tossed on the shelf a few hours earlier.

Dontcha hear me? Beg me to let you go. Crawl over an lick my boots.
Maybe Ill go easy on you like you two dern fools done with me. A
jangle of hideous laughter accompanied his words. He kicked his opponent
in the side.

Hugh looked at him steadily, without a word.

Thought you had the Injun sign on me, eh? Both of you? Well, Ill say
right here there never was a minute I was scared of either one of
youor both. Me, Im Sam Dutch, a sure enough killer. An youyoure
Number Fifteen. Ole Dan Tuckers come to git his supper, an he aint
too late, neither.

He was working himself up for murder. Soon his passion would be boiling
over. Then he would strike.

One thought dominated Vicky, drove out all others. She must save Hugh
McClintock. She forgot to be afraid, forgot to remember that this
scoundrel was the terror of Nevada. Noiselessly she crept forward and
pushed the revolver into his back just below the shoulders.

If you move Ill shoot you, she said hoarsely.

The stream of curses died in the fellows throat. His jaw fell.
Ludicrously his immature mind groped with the situation.
