Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Tommy Strike, during his tumultuous career with his world-famous
fiance, had known some wild celebrations. But he had never witnessed
anything like the welcome that awaited them this time.

At a brief stopover on Mars for fresh food, Gerry had broken the whole
fantastic story, which had promptly been forwarded by ether-beam to
Earth in complete detail--the treacherous attempt of pirates to seize
_The Ark_ and murder its crew, the marooning, the outwitting of certain
death, the strange fight, and finally the return of Gerry Carlyle,
bringing the criminals back alive.

For the last leg of Mars-Earth run, they had an escort of police craft,
and in mid-space, an armed guard was put aboard. Privately, the crew
considered this very unnecessary, but Gerry permitted it only as part
of a hard bargain she characteristically drove--an understanding that
before Dacres was indicted, she would have first crack at his bank
account to pay for the trip to Triton, exactly as contracted for.

And now the home spaceport was in truth a sea of humanity, frothing
with white, as thousands of faces turned upward to watch the descent.
There were cheers, and speeches, and officials, and photographers, and
tele-newscasters.

Autograph-hunters broke through the police lines time and again. There
was a nasty few minutes as Dacres and his band were hustled through
the crowd to the police 'copters. And during it all, Gerry Carlyle and
Tommy Strike remained smiling, gracious and friendly. Such marked
adulation would have embarrassed any but the most poised.

Finally as the celebrants began to drift away, one of the reporters
spotted McCray standing patiently in _The Ark's_ air-lock. Instantly,
climax piled upon climax, as the man shouted:

"Hey, look! It's Kid McCray! It's the missing Martian middleweight
champ!"

Back came the crowds, the cameramen, the broadcasters. The crew of _The
Ark_ turned to McCray with jaws ludicrously agape. "You mean you really
_are_ a boxing champion?" Gerry cried.

McCray grinned self-consciously.

"I tried to tell ya. Nobody wouldn't believe me, that's all."

"Well, I'll be--!" Gerry swore a ladylike oath, to the broadcasters'
confusion, and the delight of everyone else.

Then a hundred questions showered on the little group, and bit by bit
the amazing story behind McCray's presence on _The Ark_ came out.

Darkness was approaching when the spectators, surfeited with the
excitement and surprises of the afternoon, at last gave the weary
wanderers rest.

Comparatively alone at last, _The Ark's_ crew grinned feebly at one
another. Tommy Strike had been very thoughtful since McCray's identity
was established. Now he tried to move unobtrusively away. Too late. The
erstwhile, pushed-around menial placed a firm hand on the captain's arm.

"Uh, look, Mr. Strike. There's sump'in I just gotta do. I only dropped
the duke a few times in my life, an' every time I come back to reverse
the decision. Even with Dacres an' Monk, I squared things. So you're
the only fellow in the world to stop me--remember that first day
in the pilot room?--who I ain't got even with. Doncha see? I'm the
champ. I just _have_ to reverse that decision." His eyes pleaded for
understanding.

Strike nodded resignedly.

"Matter of principle, I suppose?"

"Sure." McCray nodded eagerly. "It won't take long. Just one knockdown,
strictly friendly. You won't hardly feel it, Mr. Strike."

"Okay." Strike's fists came up, and they squared off.

McCray bobbed and weaved, bored in after the retreating Strike--and
suddenly the pugilist's feet slid into a weird tangle and he sat down
hard. He leaned forward to clutch his ankle and howled in anguish.

Strike, who hadn't landed a blow, and the amazed spectators gathered
around. McCray's ankle was visibly swelling--a bad sprain. The bout was
over. "What on earth happened?" Strike inquired.

McCray gave up groaning a moment, pointed to the moist, bruised peel
of a Martian banana, then looked around accusingly for a culprit to
blame. His glance stopped on Gerry Carlyle, whose cheeks were bulging
as she chewed heroically. She gulped it down.

Breathless, she raised her fianc's arm.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Tommy Strike and his fiance, Gerry Carlyle, are on their way back to Earth after a stint on Mars. They are met with a hero's welcome, as the news of their adventures has preceded them. Among the crowd is a reporter who spots Kid McCray, the missing Martian middleweight champ.
McCray is revealed to be a stowaway on their ship, and the story of how he came to be there is slowly revealed. He was originally supposed to be part of a boxing match on Mars, but when the event was cancelled, he hitched a ride on _The Ark_ in hopes of getting back to Earth.
During the journey, he proved to be a valuable asset to the crew, but was always treated as a menial. Now that they're back, he wants to have a friendly boxing match with Strike to even the score.
However, before they can begin, McCray trips on a banana peel and sprains his ankle. The match is called off and McCray is left to lick his wounds.
