SCENE:
XXXII
A SURPRISE


At Boxwell Hall a large audience sat expectantly waiting the appearance
of Mrs. Lucien.

Among the members present there were five with whom our readers are
familiar. The lights were yet turned low, and there was the usual buzz
and hum of low-voiced conversation which even those afflicted with
superstitious awe could not repress.

I had some trouble to persuade Major Walden to come, said Nathan in an
aside to his wife. He has such a horror of this sort of thing, he
flatly refused at first; but when I asked him as a personal favor to
meet you, he consented.

I am sure he cant denounce Mrs. Lucien, if she is as Elinor describes
her, said Lissa. I have really begun to like her, just from the
description. Ah, I wonder if she is coming now. What a perfectly
seraphic face.

Mrs. Lucien was clothed in a soft, clinging gown of white wool, from
which her pure, oval face arose in statuesque grace and beauty.

The dark waves of her hair were brushed back from the rounded forehead
and gleamed in shining ripples to her neck as the glare of the
foot-lights fell upon her.

What a striking face! A painter might have made a model of her for a
Madonna. She is grace personified, whispered Alice. I can think of
nothing but a statue of one of the graces.

Doesnt she look more like a painting of St. Cecilia? Mark replied.

Yes, she does look like her. She is about to speak.

The chairman of the psychical club led her forward and briefly
introduced her as Madame Lucien, who would give exhibitions of
psychometric reading and slate-writing. Mrs. Lucien bowed slightly for a
moment to the vociferous clapping of hands which greeted her, and then
spoke in a low, sympathetic voice, which thrilled her hearers.

Dear Friends: I do not come to you to-night with any gift or knowledge
of my own winning. For some inscrutable reason it has been given me to
read that which my physical eyes cannot discern. By some psychic
telepathy, or telegraphy, which is as mysterious to me as to any one
here, I am made the bearer of messages and permitted to see and describe
to you that which is not visible to our mortal eyes.

She turned toward the gentleman by whom she had been presented, who now
bound a handkerchief tightly over her eyes, and addressing the audience,
requested that while Madame Lucien was passing under control an usher
would gather up from the audience such articles as they would like to
submit to the medium for psychic reading and identification.

Handkerchiefs, gloves, pocket knives, etcetera, were being collected,
and Nathan was about to detach a charm from his watchguard with which to
test her powers, when he chanced to glance up at Major Walden.

He was startled. The scene at the office seemed about to be reenacted.
The Majors face was livid and distorted.

What is the matter? Nathan asked with alarm.

Youyouknew of this! Walden hissed, with a desperate effort at
self-control.

Knew of what? Great Heavens, Major, what do you mean?

I cant stay here. I will not! He arose to his feet, and Nathan,
taking his arm, led him to the open air.

Youre a villain, sir! I wouldnt have treated an enemy as you have me.
And I thought you my friend and trusted you. O Nathan, Nathan, how could
you have done it? Why didnt you tell me?

Major Walden, I dont understand what I have done that was wrong. Pon
my honor I dont! said Nathan stoutly. You knew it was a spirit

Did you ask me to that place to-night? Tell me!

I certainly did, but I did not suppose it could be so offensive to
you.

You asked me there to see her?

Her? Whom? My wife? I asked you to meet my wife, and Mrs. Wylie, and

And her, the woman that
