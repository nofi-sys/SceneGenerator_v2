SCENE:
XIII.


Every circumstance connected with the coming race meeting disgusted
Bulstrode more and more. One night, sitting over the walnuts and the
wine in the dining-room at Deerchase with Skelton and Lewis, Bulstrode
gave vent to his dissatisfaction. He did not always dine with Skelton,
and, indeed, when Bob Skinnys emissary came to his door to say that
dinner was served, Bulstrode would generally answer: Oh, hang dinner!
I had a chop in the middle of the day, and Ill be shot if Ill sit for
two hours with Skelton over a lot of French kickshaws, with him looking
superciliously at me every time I touch the decanter. Bob Skinny
would translate this message as follows: Mr. Bulstrode, he present he
compliments, sah, an he say, ef you will have de circumlocution to
excuse him, he done had he dinner.

Lewis, though, always dined with Skelton and enjoyed it. Skelton was
at his best at dinner, and would sometimes exert himself to please
the boy, whose tastes were singularly like his own. Lewis liked the
exquisitely appointed table, the sight of the flowers upon it, the
subtile air of luxury pervading the whole. He liked to lie back in his
chair, making his one small glass of sherry last as long as he could,
looking out upon the black clumps of the shrubbery that loomed large
in the purple twilight, listening to the soft, melodious ripple of the
broad river, and to Skeltons musical voice as he talked. It always
vexed him when Miles Lightfoot was of the party, who was, however,
under a good deal of restraint in Skeltons presence.

On this particular evening, though, Bulstrode was dining with Skelton
and Lewis. The room was dim, for all the wax candles in the world
could not light it brilliantly, and it was odorous with the scent of
the blossoms of a dogwood tree that bloomed outside, and even thrust
their bold, pretty faces almost through the window. But Bulstrode was
undeniably cross, and uncomfortably attentive to the decanters.

And how did Jaybird do to-day, Lewis? asked Skelton; but before Lewis
could answer, Bulstrode burst out:

Jaybird go to perdition! Every time I think of him I remember that if
the horse wins that race, Blair will be a ruined man. That is, he is
more than half ruined already, but that will finish him.

I shall be sorry, but I cant see how anybody but Blair can be held
responsible, answered Skelton calmly. If a man who cant afford it
_will_ follow horse racing, and if he _will_ put up a scrub against
a thoroughbred, why, theres no stopping him; that man has an inbred
folly that must bring him to ruin some time or other. I dont think
this race, or any race especially, will effect the result. Blair has a
passion for gambling on the turf, and that will ruin any man.

Lewis listened to this with a troubled face. Skeltons eyes saw it,
and he felt angry with Bulstrode for putting such things into the
boys head. And besides, Lewis was only fifteen, and suppose his
feelings should be worked upon to the extent that he should be guilty
of the enormity of pulling the race? Skelton hastened to change the
conversation.

The dinner was shorter than usual that night, and Lewis had to gulp
down the last half of his glass of wine rather hurriedly. Skelton went
off as usual to a corner of the square stone porch and smoked steadily.
To his surprise, Bulstrode followed him and sat down on a bench. After
a while Bulstrode began, argumentatively:

I dont see why you want to drive Blair to the wall.

Skelton took his cigar from his lips, and was silent with astonishment.
Bulstrode never presumed to force himself into Skeltons private
affairs that way.

And, continued Bulstrode, with his rich, beautiful voice full of
tears, he has that sweet and charming wife. Good God! Skelton, you
must have a heart of stone!

Skeltons impulse was to pick up a chair and brain Bulstrode on the
spot, but instead, he only said coldly:

You have been drinking, Bulstrode. You cant let a decanter pass you.

Yes, Ive been drinking, cried Bulstrode, with a frank laugh; but
you know yourself Im a much better and braver man drunk than sober.
When Im sober Im cowed by that devilish cool gentlemanliness of
yours; but when Ive had a bottle of port Im as good a man as you,
Skelton; and I see that you will never be happy until you have made
Blair the wretchedest man alive. Come, now. Youve got lashings of
money. Blair is as poor as a church mouse. You have got everything on
earth.

Skelton had risen during this, and could scarcely keep his hands off
Bulstrode where he sat; but it was grotesque enough that he could not
make Bulstrode hold his tongue. He could only say between his teeth:
