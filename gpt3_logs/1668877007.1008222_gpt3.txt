SCENE:
Your aff. Son,

DUDLEY.

Dud was highly pleased with that letter, for he discovered that he
had bettered his usual four pages by two more. There was besides, he
decided, a literary flavor to it that most of his epistles lacked; and
he was certain that his father would chuckle about forgetting to post
that letter; and maybe he would send the allowance right away!

After it was finished he and Jimmy went down to the Beach and, since
they had no canoe of their own and the punts belonging to the school
were hard to row and likely to prove leaky, borrowed one of the many
that reposed under the trees along the Cove. They were in doubt for
a while as to which particular craft to requisition, since it was
distinctly advisable to select one whose owner was not likely to want
it that day. The difficulty was finally solved by Dud, who recalled
the fact that young Twining was in the infirmary with German measles.
Twining was only a junior, anyway, and juniors had few rights even when
perfectly well, and still fewer when they werent! So Dud blithely led
the way to a gorgeous light blue Old Town, and together they bore it to
the muddy water of the Cove and clambered in.

Its the best canoe here, too, observed Jimmy contentedly, as he
dipped his paddle at the bow. (Jimmy took the bow paddle because, or
so he declared, there was more responsibility connected with that
position. Dud, while not deceived in the least, never objected, for he
had a notion that stern paddling would develop his arm muscles.) They
say that little bounder has heaps of money, millions and millions;
that is, his dad has. Did I ever tell you about the old darkey woman
who used to work for us? She was telling mother about some man who
was terribly rich, you know, and mother said, I suspect hes a
millionaire, Dorah. A millionaire, Mis Logan! says she. Bless yo
heart, honey, that mans got sevral millions of airs! Guess thats
the way with Twinings dad, eh?

Thats a peach of a canoe that Ordways got, said Dud, after he had
laughed at Jimmys story.

Too fancy, replied the other as they left the Cove and headed down
the river. He has about everything in it except a grand piano!

I suppose it cost a lot, said Dud.

Ill bet it did. I told him the other day that it was too pretty to
use, and he said he thought it was, too. Seems he didnt know much
about canoes and let Bert Winslow order it, and Bert got all the
trimmings the law allows. Thats like Bert. I guess its too heavy to
handle well. Here comes Brew Longley and Foster Tray. Dont forget to
speak now!

A battered green canoe occupied by two youths passed and salutations
were exchanged. For once Dud managed to get just the proper amount
of mixed hauteur and friendliness in his greeting. Somehow, since
yesterday, it wasnt so hard to do things like that. Tray, a football
player and track team member, laughed as the canoes passed. See you
got a canoe now, Jimmy, he called.

Jimmy waved his paddle nonchalantly. Yes, its a poor thing but mine
own. Ill let you use it, Tray, any time you like. I believe in lending
to them as hasnt.

You believe in borrowing, too, dont you? laughed Longley.

Anything but trouble, responded Jimmy, over his shoulder.

They paused near the old wooden bridge beyond the boathouse to watch
an automobile dash by at some forty miles an hour, and Jimmy sighed
as he began to paddle again. I always think every time that the old
affair will fall into the river, but it never does. I never do have any
luck! Beyond the bridge, where the river widened as it wound through
the marshes, they met a canoe at about every turn. Many were drawn to
the bank, and their crews were usually lying at ease above. About two
miles beyond the bridge and within view of Needham Falls they overtook
a white canoe, or a canoe that had been white at one time, apparently
empty, since at a little distance nothing showed but an idle paddle and
the backs of the seats.

That, mused Dud, looks like Ordways. It must have got away from him
somewhere further back. Wed better tow it home, hadnt we?

I guess so. Got anything we can tie it up with? Jimmy altered the
direction of his craft to run alongside the derelict.

Maybe we can use my belt, Dud suggested. But at that moment they came
near enough to see into the white canoe and discovered that it was far
from empty, since two forms were stretched out flat on the bottom.
One had the colored pages of a Sunday paper over his face and was
consequently unrecognizable, but the other was unmistakably Nick Blake
himself. Jimmy signaled to stop paddling and the canoe floated silently
alongside.
