SCENE:
XXV
TIBBY CONQUERS


Upon the second afternoon of Marks absence from home Alice was
surprised by the dreaded appearance of Professor Russell. The man had
changed his outward guise considerably. His auburn whiskers had given
place to a smooth-shaven chin. A red mustache, grizzled with white,
decked his upper lip, and his hair was closely cut. Even his eyebrows
seemed to have shared in the general cut, and the man looked sleeker
and, if possible, more like Uriah Heep than before. Alice did not at
first recognize him as he came toward the house, but a glance from those
gray-green eyes identified him.

She shrank back with a perceptible shudder of abhorrence.

You here, Professor? I supposed you had departed to lands afar! she
exclaimed.

You did not then receive notice of my coming? he asked, with a meaning
look.

Notice? Nowhyhow could I?

I have numerous unseen messengers.

Again Alice shivered, and turning toward her sister-in-law, beckoned her
approach. Mrs. Wylie left the bunch of prairie flowers she was plucking,
and came forward, while at the same time Tibby came around the corner of
the house, leading Robert.

As Alice presented the Professor to each in her turn, she observed the
keen look he cast upon them, and noted later the return of his gaze to
Tibby. Her beauty was evidently not lost upon him.

As for Tibby, she regarded him steadily, as again and again his eyes
sought hers. They appeared like two children trying to look one another
out of countenance. Then Russells eyes fell and he turned to enter the
house, while Tibby, her eyes dancing in triumph, followed him in and sat
down opposite him, watching him much as a cat watches the crevice in a
wall through which a mouse has disappeared. Evidently Tibby was very
ill-bred. There was a peculiar electrical charging of the air. Mrs.
Wylie noticed it, and looked apprehensively out of doors to see if a
storm was approaching, then at Alice. Alice felt its influence and
trembled. Tibby alone seemed unmoved and entirely serene. A wicked,
yellow gleam shone in her expressive eyes.

Is your husband at home, Mrs. Cramer? Russell asked at length, after
taking a chair a short distance from the door, and tilting it slightly
backward against the wall.

No, I am sorry to say he is not. But why do you ask, Professor? I
supposed you always knew.

I have neglected to make inquiry this time, Mrs. Cramer. Undoubtedly I
might have learned had done so.

Tibby rolled up her eyes with an expression of youthful innocence.

What a lovely idea that would be for making calls, Mrs. Wylie! One
could always go and leave cards when people were away from home.

Mrs. Wylie shook her head at the girl reprovingly.

Ahem! I have taken the liberty to invite over some of our friends for a
meeting to-night, said the Professor.

Mrs. Cramer could hardly repress signs of her annoyance.

I am very sorry she began. It is unfortunate Mark is not here or
that you did not take the trouble to inquire beforehand. For he
decidedly objects to anything of the kind here in his absence.

Truly, Alice was becoming brave.

I am sorry for Marks blindness, the Professor said, with priestly
assumption.

Mark blind? How very strange. I should never have suspected it, said
Tibby with childish naivete.

He is blind to the truth, Miss Waring. A sort of moral blindness, which
is the worst form of ophthalmia.

Oh! Tibby opened her eyes to their widest extent and met his look
squarely. Then her eyes narrowed until only a rim of blue was visible,
and she did not take them off the visitor. It soon became evident that
the Professor was annoyed by this childish scrutiny. He changed his
position several times and finally turned upon the girl abruptly.
