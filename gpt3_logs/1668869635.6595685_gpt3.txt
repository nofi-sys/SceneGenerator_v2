SCENE:
"Of course, I do," I answered with a leaping heart, but trying to
appear unconcerned. "It's no place for a woman."

She merely bowed her head and said nothing. What she thought I could
not know. Nor can I remember much of what I thought myself. Mingled
with my joy over the delay, there seemed to be vague imaginings of my
holding Dartmoor by the heels over the taffrail and dropping him into
the water. But I am not sure that these visions did not come later.

Wrong, of course; but I was an angry and jealous man.

I saw her once more before we sailed, but could not move her. She was
kind, gentle with me, and sorrowful, but obedient to the influence of
Dartmoor, with no will but his. So I gave it up for the time, trusting
not to a watery grave to break his influence but to his absence from
her.

We transferred the freak by night and lodged it in the hold, where I
had built a sort of enclosure under the cabin trunk for the apparatus.
Dartmoor brought a couple of his servants along to carry on the daily
exercising, and my Kanaka crew expressed no curiosity concerning the
strange weights they hoisted over the side at midnight. So, we got away
without trouble.

Whether or not Dartmoor exercised any mental influence over me I do
not know. I felt a healthy hatred for him as the man who had taken the
woman I loved, but I could not bring myself to quarrel with him. He
could not force me to like him, but possibly he disarmed my resentment
by his kindly feeling for me.

My island was a small affair, as islands go--merely the top of a
submerged mountain--surrounded by a barrier reef with only one passage
through it; and this entrance was known to no one but myself. Well
up from the beach I had erected huts for my coolie divers and a
comfortable house for myself on the high ground near a spring of water.

Here I purposed to install Dartmoor and the freak; but I wondered,
grimly and ungenerously, as I steered through the dangerous passage and
glanced at a dismantled hulk wrecked on the reef during my absence, as
to the chances of anybody getting off that island without my consent.

As we let go the anchor, a man pulled out in a small dingey I kept for
exploring the lagoon and climbed aboard. He was tall, elderly, and mild
of face and manner.

"Glad to see a white face again," he said as he offered me his hand.
"You are the captain, I believe--the white chief of these poor heathen.
I am Mr. Pfeffer, a seagoing missionary, and my little craft was
wrecked here last week while trying to make the passage in a storm. I
am the only one saved, and I owe my life to your divers. They have been
very kind to me, a shipwrecked wayfarer, and I would like to remain
among them a while, if it is possible for me to do so."

"Stay as long as you like, Mr. Pfeffer," I answered. "Convert us all,
if you like; but there's a critter down below that's proof, I'll
warrant."

He asked questions, and Dartmoor explained. Then the missionary
inspected the monstrosity.

"I consider my shipwreck as an act of God," he said, as he came on
deck. "You will succeed, Mr. Dartmoor, I know you will. And I will be
here, to aid you with prayer and spiritual help. For this new-born
intelligence must be trained to know and believe in the goodness of
God, who creates nothing without a purpose. It is all clear, now,
captain. I have been brought here to assist."

I did not dispute him. Fish, yams, and cocoanuts were plentiful on that
island, and I had other things to think of. An overhauling of the work
done in my absence and a trip to Honolulu for supplies would keep me
busy for some time.

As I was about to start, Dartmoor's two servants asked to be taken with
me. I consulted Dartmoor, and he sadly advised it. They did not like
the quiet life on the island and, though he had offered more pay, they
were not content. I landed them at Honolulu and saw no more of them.

Their going left the manual work of exercising the freak to Dartmoor,
and I grinned shamelessly. At this juncture I had half a mind to run
over to San Francisco and make another appeal to Ella, but gave it up.
She might not have grown away from him yet; and at any rate I could
keep Dartmoor on the island as long as I pleased. To such dark depths
of knavery does jealousy bring a man.

I ran back to the island, and no sooner was the anchor down than
Dartmoor and the dominie appeared on the beach, shouting and
gesticulating like lunatics. Then, over the noise they made, there came
from the house up the hill a sound like the braying of a burro mixed
with the wail of a fog siren. Then I heard Dartmoor.
