SCENE:
XI.

An Argument.


The trusty pedler made no unnecessary delay on his return journey from
Provincetown. The sandy road somewhat retarded his progress, but Master
Walkers horse was a good one and needed little urging. There were,
of course, some necessary explanations to be made to the Provincetown
committee, and the worthy citizens who had charge of affairs in that
place were much disturbed when they got confirmation of the rumor that
the British were fully determined to assume the offensive in earnest.
So far as Provincetown was directly concerned, Raggetts change of
front would not materially add to the troubles of the inhabitants, who
were already completely at the enemys mercy. But for their neighbors
and friends in the other towns of the lower Cape, Master Jonathan Cook
and his colleagues were deeply concerned.

You will tell them at Eastham, Phil, said the chairman, that we
regret our inability to be of any assistance to them. Our own poor town
is in a sad plight and I fear me if this war continues much longer we
shall have a repetition of the exodus of Revolutionary times.

An sure I will, Master Cook, an sorry I am to see this fine town in
such a bad state. Twas mighty aisy for a poor man to make a dacint
livin here a few years ago when the fishin was bringin loads o
money to the people. But now, God help us! the good days are gone an
nobody has any money more than they want for thimselves.

Thats so, Phil. However, we hear that our privateers are doing great
damage to the enemys commerce, and when John Bull finds his trade in
danger he will want the war stopped.

With many expressions of sympathy, they bade the pedler Godspeed.

When Peter Walker heard Phils story he lost no time in informing the
Committee of Safety. It was too late that evening to call a public
meeting, but there was a crowded attendance at Crosbys tavern and Phil
the Fifer was eagerly questioned regarding his interview with Hoppy.

I reckon Hoppy felt rather miserable, Phil? How did he like the idea
of acting as pilot? asked Obed Sparrow.

To tell you the truth, Master Sparrow, replied Phil, Captain Mayo
didnt like the position; but as to bein miserable, well, I dont
think its his nature to feel so at any time.

Its a wonder that British officer did not suspect something.

Oh, Lieutenant Jameson is a rale gintleman, an he knows, besides,
that old Phil wouldnt desave him!

The old mans innocent expression as he said this caused general
laughter.

If he should hear the result of your visit, Phil, he wont be so
confiding the next time, said Squire Knowles.

Faith, an Im sure he wont, squire. But Im thinkin it will be a
long time before the lieutenant will see me agin. This war will soon be
over, plaze God, an the foreigners will sail away an lave the people
o Cape Cod in paice wance more.

What makes you think so, Phil?

Well, squire, I heard some talk in Yarmouth about the work o the
American privateers among the British ships, an Master Cook o
Provincetown told me the same story. Tis said that John Bull is
grumbling about the loss hes sufferin an that the big merchants o
London wont stand it much longer. Our frind John is like the rest of
us, he hates to get touched in the pocket.

So Hoppy is going as pilot, said Captain Jared Higgins; thats about
the last thing Id expect from Hoppy Mayo!

As I told you, replied Phil to this, Captain Mayo said that some
people might think it quare that he agreed to it; but you neednt fear
about him, Captain Higgins; hell never turn thraitor. Whatever he has
in his mind to do I cant tell you, but from the little he told me I
can see that his mind is workin hard at some plan to get the betther
o the inimy. All I know is that he wanted you to have faith in him,
an anywan who knows Captain Mayo will find that enough.

Thats right, Phil; I firmly believe Hoppy will outwit them! cried
Peter Walker.

This war will beggar the people of Cape Cod, anyway, growled Captain
Jared. If the President took Governor Strongs advice there would be
no war.
