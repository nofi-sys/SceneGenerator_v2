Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
They had lit a fire in the hearth below.  The thin wisp of smoke grew
into a column swirling unsteadily upwards.  It became a solid volume
choking and hot.  With a sob of pain and despair Rob covered his face
with his bonnet.  For a few minutes that relieved his eyes and nose,
but the danger of being suffocated was only subordinate to being
roasted alive.  It was a great roaring fire they were laying.  He
heard the loose sticks and dried heather falling in bundles on the
blaze.

His ears sang with the suffocation of it, his brain swirled and his
breath came in short gasps as a fish gasps upon a bank.  And then
with a pitiful cry he fell forward, down upon the fire itself and
with a swirl of smoke and sparks, into the midst of the soldiers.

The officer thinking that the blackened, tattered figure might be the
Prince himself hastened to stamp out the tongues of flame upon his
clothes, and dragging him to his feet stared into his face.

"Tuts," he said in a tone of deep disappointment.  "It's only a boy."

"It's the lad who escaped," cried a soldier peering at him; "the Duke
offers fifty pounds for his arrest."

"What lad?" asked the officer, eyeing Rob with some interest.

"Rob Fraser, he knows...," but the officer broke in, "Never mind what
he knows," he said testily, "bind him and set him against the wall."

Long after when Rob was come to himself and his eyes more accustomed
to the light from the great fire he watched the officer at his
supper.  He was a small red-haired man with cold blue eyes and white
eyebrows, for all the world like a badger, and with Campbell written
all over him.  It was an evil day when a Campbell could strut over
the country-side at his ease.

Having finished his food and offering none to Rob, who nearly begged
him for a mouthful so famished was he, the officer lit his pipe and
called in his men, telling them they could sleep along the walls of
the place.

Greatly affable through meat and drink he also fell into
conversation, and being like most little men very anxious to show
what a terrible fellow he was, with the spirit of a giant, he related
the tale of the banshee of Loch Fyne, and told it so capably that the
soldiers drew a little together and sent the bottle round in some
uneasiness.

"It came from a lonely island," he said, "and none saw it pass over
the grey face of the loch--but there was a mournful cry that seemed
to be far up in the clouds and a cold wind passing like a wraith
along the barren shore.  Oh it was the rare one the banshee of Loch
Fyne, and some said it lived in the lonely island where the dead lay,
for it always passed that way, and it never travelled alone."

"I don't like these Highland tales," said one Englishman with a
shiver, "least of all hereabouts.  There was a ghost I've heard tell
in Holmbury Hall..."

"Whisht to your ghosts," broke in a large Lowland Scot, whose eyes
were great with the story of the banshee.  "Captain here has seen the
banshee, have ye no, sir?"

Now the officer had never before claimed that privilege.  It is
improbable that he had ever been to the shores of Loch Fyne, being a
Glen Etive man, and it is also open to question whether the dreaded
banshee was not a traveller's tale.  However that may be he was not
prepared to disappoint his hearers at so propitious a time.

"Once--once," he replied, being a man as truthful as a lie would
permit, "only once and that at midnight--a clear moon in the sky and
no wind to speak of.  I was a youngster at the time, barely twenty,
and as reckless as could be.  It was always said that the banshee
rose from the ancient burial-place at twelve o'clock, and floating
across the loch set out on her evil errand.  There are those who
heard poor Angus Campbell wailing all through a winter's night and
his voice up in the clouds, 'Tha e lamhan fuar: Tha e lamhan fuar!
It has a cold, cold hand!'"

"My goodness," gasped the Lowlander, dragging himself nearer to the
fire.

On every face about the dying blaze superstitious fear was written.
Even Rob, weak with want of food and full of misery, heard his teeth
chatter at the picture the little man drew--for he was an artist in
gruesome effects.

"Over I rowed," he continued, "and the whole clachan watched me go.
I rowed out over the silvery loch under a rising moon, and there was
no whisper of what was to come, not even the soft music that the
banshee..."
