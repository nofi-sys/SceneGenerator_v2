SCENE:
THE door bell of Larrys home at the end of Murphys Court kept up an
almost constant ringing next morning, and old Mrs. Coogans breath grew
short through answering the calls.

First it was McGonagle and Larkin, dressed in their best, with beaming
faces and movements of suppressed excitement.

Everytings all to the velvet, said Goose airily. The girls have
been up and dressed since five oclock, and Father Dawsonll do his
turn at eleven, sharp.

Say, Larry, put in Jimmie, one bridesmaids goin to do for both;
who dyouse tink it is?

I dont know, replied Larry.

Its Maggie Dwyer, said Jimmie. Say, theres a girl for yer life!
Shes got em all tied hand an foot.

If there was no Annie, remarked Goose, and I had the drag with
Maggie that youse have, why her named be McGonagle in short order,
leme tell ye that.

Gway, said Larry. Quit yer stringin.

This is on the level, insisted McGonagle. Ive heard it talked about
for years. Everybody in the ward knowed that she wanted ye,--everybody
but yerself. But, say, youse seemed so dead leary about the ting that
nobody had the nerve to say anyting to youse.

After the two young men departed, a perfect stream of reporters began
to call, all anxious to get Larrys views upon the political situation;
and when this had subsided, Mason and Kerrigan came in, to talk over
yesterday and confer about to-morrow.

Did youse see McQuirk since yesterday? asked Larry, after some time
spent in this fashion.

No, answered Kerrigan, but I received a note from him late last
night, asking me to call upon him this afternoon.

Larry nodded. I was at his house when he wrote it, said he. Youse
dont need to worry any about him; hes right in line. He kin carry the
ward, with youse on the ticket, hands down. And thats McQuirks game,
every time. As long as hes on the side that wins he can make good, ye
know, and any time they need the ward in a deal they have to come to
him with the money.

Owen Dwyer seems to think, said Mason, that the election is only a
matter of the size of Kerrigans majority.

Thats right, said Larry. In this ward, and in all the others for
that matter, the fightins done at the primaries; the guy whats
named in the regular way by the party what runs the ward, has got the
election cinched.

When he and Mason were ready to go, Kerrigan said:

I am glad that Nolan and Ferguson came out of their matter all right.
I know Cullen, one of the doctors at St. Marys, and he told me that
Mart Kellys condition, while painful, is not necessarily serious.

OConnor an Gartenheim talked to McQuirk, said Larry; and McQuirk
squared it all right at the front office. They had to give bail but the
casell never come to trial, because Jim Kelly wont push it; he knows
what Mart was done up for, and he dasnt.

McGonagle tells me that things are all O. K. in his matter, remarked
Kerrigan, as they stood upon the steps, Larry in the doorway. Ill be
on hand promptly at noon to attend to my end of it.

Larry closed the door after they had departed and returned to the
sitting room. He was glad that matters political had turned out as
they did--but only because it would prevent the loss of Owen Dwyers
savings, and thereby please Maggie--outside of that he seemed to have
lost all zest of the battle, all exultation in the victory.

Maggie was in his thoughts, Maggie and Maggie only. Since his talk
with her the morning before, she seemed to have grown nearer to him.
He did not dream that this was caused by a lessening of his sense of
inferiority--by a gradual growth of faith in himself, which had its
conception in the hardly realized fact that he had been the dominant
spirit in a matching of wits which, in result, meant not a little to
her.

He only thought of her kind manner, her smile and invitation to call
again; he only remembered Kerrigans half-jesting remark after they
had left the house. And then there were McGonagles words; Goose was a
friend of his and would not deceive him. He had said that Maggie was
not indifferent! Could this be so? Had he been so blind, so full of
self-pride as to not see it? Could it be that the aloofness with which
he had long secretly charged her had all been of his own doing? It is
not often that a man wishes himself in the wrong; but that, at this
moment, was Larrys most earnest desire.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish Larry's character and to set up the conflict for the rest of the story. Larry is shown to be a political operative who is good at his job, but he is also shown to be a man who is struggling with his own sense of self-worth. This conflict will be resolved over the course of the story.
