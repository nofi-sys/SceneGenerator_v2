Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
What makes you think anything is?

His whole make-up--somethings wearing on him.

She blew out a long shoot of smoke and, watching it, murmured:

Yes, its out on him like a rash. He oughtnt to have come, but the
first man they had, Sylvanus Grey, took sick and Mr. Walberg engaged
Stokes in a hurry and sent him up. Its spoiled everything for the rest
of us. Hes crazy about Sybil if you want to know whats the matter
with him.

Oh! It came with an understanding inflection, the haggard glances
rising on Shines memory.

Cant hide it, doesnt want to hide it. Theres no shame in him,
tracking after the girl. And its not as if he got any encouragement.
She cant bear him; thats why she has Anne Tracy out there, afraid if
she sits alone five minutes hell come loping up. Youd think if he
didnt have any pride hed have some feeling for his wife. Shes half
crazy with jealousy, burning up with it. These purple passions are all
right in books, Mr. Shine, but believe me theyre not comfortable to
live with.

I felt it.

I guess you would, its in the air. All of us cooped up in this place
where you cant get off. I thought it was going to be such a nice
restful change. But lord! Its about as restful as camping on the side
of Vesuvius. Sybil and Joe Tracy ready to fight at the drop of the hat
and Flora going round in circles and Stokes like one of those fireworks
that starts sputtering and you dont know whether theyre going to
explode or die on you. I tell you Ill be glad when we get out of here
to-morrow morning.

There was a footfall in the room behind them and Mrs. Cornell turned to
see who was coming.

Oh, Flora, she said. Come out and take a look at the sunset. Its
something grand.

The woman stepped out and stood beside them. She had changed her
costume and her narrow blue linen dress outlined her too slender
figure. Shine thought she would have been pretty if she had not looked
so worn and thin. He noticed the brightness of her dark eyes, brilliant
and quick-moving as a birds. There was red on her cheek-bones, a
flushed patch that was not rouge. Mrs. Cornells expression recurred to
him, burning up--the meager body, the hot high color, the dry lips
resolutely smiling, suggested inner fires.

Yes, she answered, its a wonderful evening.

Take a cig. Mrs. Cornell offered the box.

Sit down, theres plenty of room. Shine moved up.

No, I cant sit down. Theres something about the air that makes you
restless--too stimulating maybe. She raised her voice and called to
her husband, Aleck, arent you coming in to change your clothes?

Without moving the man called back:

Not yet. Theres no hurry.

She turned to Shine with a little condoning air of wifely tolerance:

Mr. Stokes has been shut up so long in town he cant get enough of the
fresh air.

Hes enjoying the scenery, too, Shine answered, and saw her eyes
travel to the two figures on the rock.

Oh, that of course--thats the best part of it. Then in a tone of
bright discovery: Why look where Anne and Sybil are! Have they been
there long?

Ever since Ive been here. Mrs. Cornells voice was more than
soothing, bluffly reassuring as the voice of one who tells a child
there is no ghost. And ever since Mr. Shine got through the pictures!
Wallowing in the beauties of nature like the rest of us.

Wont you wallow, too? Shine indicated the long unoccupied space on
the step.

She shook her head:

I like moving about. Something in this place gets on my nerves, its
like being in a jail. On a deep breath she shot out, I hate it, and
stepped back into the room.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The scene takes place at a sunset, with Mrs. Cornell, Shine, and Flora discussing the latter's unease. Flora is restless and doesn't want to sit down, and Mrs. Cornell attributes it to the stimulating air. She then notices Anne and Sybil on the rock and comments on how long they've been there. Shine tells her they've been there since he arrived, and Mrs. Cornell reassures Flora that it's just because Shine is new and they're enjoying the scenery. Flora then says she hates the place and goes back inside.
