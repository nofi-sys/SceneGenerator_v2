SCENE:
"Personally I am pretty sure that she will," said Mr. Norwood, with
conviction. "But it will cause a court fight. There is another
claimant, as I say."

"You are right," agreed Mr. Drew. "And he is a fighter. Ringold never
gives up a thing until he has to."

"Goodness!" breathed Amy. "Not Belle's father?"

"It is the New Melford Ringold," said Mr. Drew. "His claim is
based upon an old note that the original Padriac Haney gave some
money-lender. Ringold bought the paper along with a lot of other fishy
documents. You know, he has always been a note shaver."

"I know something about that," said Mr. Norwood, grimly. "Don't worry
too much about it. Ringold may have a lot of money, but he won't spend
too much to try to make good a bad claim. He doesn't throw a spat to
catch a herring; he would only risk a sprat for whale bait," and he
laughed.

However, the two girls had heard quite enough to yield food for chatter
for some time to come. Jessie had kept close watch of the time by her
wrist-watch. She now beckoned her chum, and they ran indoors and up the
stairs to Jessie's sitting-room.

"It is almost time for the concert from Stratfordtown," Jessie said.
"And Bertha telephoned me yesterday that she hoped to sing to-night."

"Lucky girl!" said Amy, sighing. "It's nice to have an uncle who bosses
a broadcasting station. But, never mind, Jess, we had fun the time we
were on the program. Say! the boys will be home to-morrow."

"No! Do you mean it?"

"Papa got a wireless. The _Marigold_ now has a real radio telegraph
sending and receiving set. Darry says it is great. But, of course, you
and I can't get anything from them because we do not know Morse."

"Let's learn!" exclaimed Jessie, excitedly.

"Sometimes when you get your set tuned wrong you hear some of the code.
But the telegraph wave-length is much, much longer than the phone
lengths. Guess you'd have a job listening in for anything Darry and
Burd Alling would send from that old yacht."

"We can learn the Morse alphabet, just the same, can't we?" demanded
her chum.

"Now, there you go again!" complained Amy. "Always suggesting something
that is work. I don't want to have to learn a single thing until we go
back to school in the fall. Believe me!"

Her emphasis only made Jessie laugh. She adjusted the crystal detector,
or cat's whisker, as the girls called it, and then began to tune the
coil until, with the tabs at her ears, she could hear a voice rising
out of the void, nearer and nearer, until it seemed speaking directly
in her ear:

"With which announcement we begin our evening's entertainment from the
Stratfordtown Station. The first number on the program being----"

"Do you hear that? It is Mr. Blair himself," whispered Amy eagerly.
"And he says----"

Jessie held up her hand for silence as the superintendent of the
broadcasting station at Stratfordtown went on to announce, "Miss Bertha
Blair, who will sing 'Will o' the Wisp,' Mr. Angler being at the piano.
I thank you."

The piano prelude came to the ears of the Roselawn girls almost
instantly. Jessie and Amy smiled at each other. They were proud to
think that they had something to do with Bertha's becoming a favorite
on the Stratfordtown programs, and likewise that their interest in the
girl first served to call the superintendent's attention to her. In
"The Roselawn Girls on the Program" is told of Bertha's first meeting
with her uncle who had never before seen her.

They listened to the hour's program and then tuned the receiver to get
what was being broadcasted from a city station--a talk on economics
that interested to a degree even the two high-school girls. For
frivolous as Amy usually appeared to be, she was a good scholar and,
like Jessie, stood well in her classes.

There was not much but a desire for fun in Amy's mind the next morning,
however, when she ran across the boulevard to the Norwood place. It
was right after breakfast, and she wore her middy blouse and short
skirt, with canvas ties on her feet. She trilled for Jessie under the
radio-room windows:

"You-oo! You-oo! 'Mary Ann! My Mary Ann! I'll meet you on the corner!'
Come-on-out!"
