SCENE:
And Mr. Conyers?

Gadzooks, madam, youre a genius! Skelton doesnt believe in hell in
the next world, and Conyers is trying to make a little hell of his own
in Abingdon parish; so they will do excellently well together.

Mr. Shapleigh, you dont mean to tell me that Richard Skelton doesnt
_believe in hell_? asked Mrs. Shapleigh in a shocked voice.

I do, indeed, my sweet. Im not sure that he believes in a personal
devil, or the horns and the hoofs, or even the tail.

Good gracious, Mr. Shapleigh! cried Mrs. Shapleigh in much horror and
distress. If Mr. Skelton doesnt believe in a hell, we might as well
give up asking him to dinner, because the bishop is coming next month,
and hell be certain to hear of it; and what will he say when he hears
that we have been entertaining a person like Richard Skelton, who flies
in the face of everything the bishop says we ought to believe!

Mr. Shapleigh shook his head with waggish despair, and declared
the dinner was out of the question. This, of course, renewed Mrs.
Shapleighs determination to have it, who reflected that, after all,
the bishop might not hear of it, or perhaps he might die before his
annual visitation came off--she had heard he had something the matter
with his liver, anyhow.

Sylvia listened to the discussion calmly--she was used to this kind
of thing; and as her father and mother never grew at all angry in
these matrimonial tiffs, she did not mind them, having had a lifetime
to become accustomed to them. But she felt acutely anxious about
meeting Skelton, and, in a feminine way, about the dinner. She wanted
everything to go off well, but with a person as wonderful as Mrs.
Shapleigh, it was not safe to count on anything.

In due time old Tom called at Deerchase, and was received by Skelton
with more courtesy and deference than ever before in his life. Skelton
met him in the library--a part of the building erected the first year
after Skelton left Princeton. It was a noble room, and from the floor
to the lofty ceiling were books, books, books. Old Tom had never seen
so many books together in his life before.

Skelton had changed but little. As a young man he had looked
middle-aged; as a middle-aged man he looked young. His hair had a few
grey threads in it, and Mrs. Shapleighs eager eye discovered a small
place on the top of his head, about as big as a half dollar, where the
hair was getting thin; but it took Mrs. Shapleigh to find this out--Mr.
Shapleigh didnt observe it at all. Skeltons only remarkable feature
were his eyes, which were as black and soft and fascinating as ever.
His manner had lost all of its early superciliousness--he knew too
much then to be anything but simple and unassuming. But undoubtedly
there was something imposing in his personality. He greeted old Tom
cordially, and inquired after Mrs. Shapleigh and little Sylvia.

You mean tall Sylvia, I presume, said old Tom, laughing. She is
nearly as tall as I am, and deucedly pretty, if I have any eyes.
Pardon an old mans fondness, Skelton.

No apology is needed. I am sure she is a lovely young woman; but I
begin to realise how many milestones I have passed when I think of her
as a woman grown.

Shes more than grown; she has been of a marriageable age for some
years--but a proud creature she is. She gives all sorts of flippant
reasons for refusing good matches; but the fact is, nobody is quite
good enough for her ladyship--so Sylvia thinks.

A proud, pretty creature she gave promise of being. However, we cant
understand them--the simple creature, man, is no match for the complex
creature, woman.

O Lord, no! Mr. Shapleigh brought this out with great emphasis,
having in mind Mrs. Shapleigh and what he had heard of Skeltons late
wife, who had put the very most effectual barrier he knew against her
husbands marrying again.

But now, Skelton, continued Mr. Shapleigh, earnestly, we are looking
forward to that something great which you are destined to do. No man I
know of--including those fellows Burke and Sheridan--ever gave greater
promise than you. By George! I shall never forget to my dying day the
state of public feeling after the publication of that first pamphlet of
yours. You would have been nominated to Congress by acclamation had you
been twenty-one years old.

A flush rose in Skeltons dark face. That early triumph had been the
bugbear of his whole life.

I regard that as a very crude performance, he said curtly.
It happened to have a peculiar aptness--it struck a particular
conjunction. That was the real reason of its success.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

In the scene, Mr. Shapleigh is discussing with his wife and daughter the possibility of inviting Richard Skelton to dinner. Mrs. Shapleigh is against the idea, as she has heard that Mr. Skelton does not believe in hell, and she is worried about what the bishop will say if he finds out. Mr. Shapleigh eventually agrees to invite Mr. Skelton, and old Tom is sent to Deerchase to extend the invitation.
When old Tom arrives, he is met by Mr. Skelton in the library. The two men chat for a while about Sylvia, and Mr. Shapleigh expresses his hope that Mr. Skelton will do something great with his life. Mr. Skelton is noncommittal, but old Tom is sure that he has the potential for greatness.
