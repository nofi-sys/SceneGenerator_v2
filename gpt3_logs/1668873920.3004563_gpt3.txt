Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
They were parked on the dark side of Mercury, snug and comfortable in
their hemisphere of force that kept out the cold and kept in the air.
At one side where force met ground, a tall silvery spacecraft rose like
a chimney.

They were three:

Chat Honger was tall, red-headed, and thin faced. He looked as though
he were incapable of quieting down, but he was really the type of
person who has an incredible amount of patience for things which cannot
be performed in a hurry.

Bren Fallow was shorter than Chat Honger, darker, stouter, more round
of face and more amiable. Definitely, Bren was the methodical type.

The third man was Scyth Radnor. Scyth was the kind of man who is quick
to grasp a new idea and as quick to reduce it to practise. His failing
was that he seldom looked deep or planned far ahead. Being quick of
mind he preferred to play everything by ear because planning required
study, and Scyth felt that study for the sake of study consumed too
much time--time that could better be spent in the pursuit of fun and
games.

Teach them the language and drop them in Greater New York and they
would be lost among Manhattan's millions. Better change their clothing,
though. Striped shorts, Greek sandals, a Sam Browne belt across a bare
chest, and a Roman toga of iridescent changing hues is not the kind of
costume seen on Fifth Avenue.

Aside from their costume they were human to the last detail. Even their
speech, when translated, sounded like the human tongue. They used
slang, elision, swearwords and poor grammar. They made bum jokes and
puns. They sounded more like displaced earthmen than technicians from a
culture that had been establishing galactic centers of population for
thirty thousand years.

"You're certain?" asked Bren.

Scyth nodded. "Dead certain now. It was that last computation that sold
me."

"Then I'd better shut down."

Chat Honger shook his head. "We've got a job to do. We're behind
schedule now, fellows, because of this question. We've got a beacon to
start here, I say let's get along with it and bedamned to the--"

"You can't," said Bren. "The first time you put down in the log that
this is a middle sequence flare-star, right smack-dab in the middle of
Yalt Gangrow's Diagram, the Bureau of Colonization is going to ask you
if you took a look for habitable planets. Then--then what, Scyth?"

Scyth Radnor shrugged. "The answer is 'yes' we took a look and we
found one, just at the right distance, the right size, and the right
conditioning. To say nothing of upper atmosphere and other data made by
observation. So Planet Three is about as habitable as Marandis itself."

Chat grunted. "Looked for any signs of life?"

Scyth nodded. "The phanobands are as dead as you-know-what. The
machinus fields are all as dead as one might expect this far from
any established route. There are a few bits and dabs of stuff on the
radiomagnetic spectrum which show a recurrent pattern too fast to be
anything of natural phenomena, however. I say we ought to take a look."

Chat shook his head slowly. "I didn't expect to find it inhabited. But
even knowing it is habitable is--"

Bren said, "If mere habitability is all you're after we can go ahead
and establish our beacon and leave Planet Three to be handled later. A
beacon wouldn't ruin the planet itself, you know."

Scyth said, "We'd better take a look-see anyhow. That last computation
on the radiomagnetic stuff looked too much like man-made radiation to
me."

Bren Hallow smiled. "Look," he said slowly, "If this planet is
inhabited, how come the Bureau of Colonization doesn't know about it.
Not one case in the history of Marandis shows the discovery of an
inhabited planet that--"

Chat interrupted, sourly, "that didn't stem from Marandanian origin.
But how about the several cases of spacewreck? Look what we're doing.
We're setting up beacons along a rift through the galaxy from Marandis
to the Spiral Cluster. We found this rift after years of hard work
and galactic surveying and exploring, and both of you know just how
fabulous it is. Well, suppose someone found it twenty thousand years
ago and got marooned?"

"So what do we do? Take a run to Planet Three and radiate machinus
fields all over space? Not until we know. So, Scyth, can you ducky us
up a high-sensitivity job out of one of the standard menslators?"


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene takes place on the dark side of Mercury, where three men are parked in their hemisphere of force. They are discussing the possibility that there is a habitable planet in the area, and whether or not they should investigate it.
Chat Honger is tall and thin-faced, Bren Fallow is shorter and rounder-faced, and Scyth Radnor is the quick-minded one. They are all human in appearance, except for their strange clothing.
Scyth Radnor is convinced that there is a habitable planet nearby, and that they should investigate it. Chat Honger is not so sure, but Bren Fallow is open to the idea.
They decide to investigate the planet, and use a menslator to try and find signs of life. However, they are not sure what they will do if they find that the planet is inhabited.
