What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Well, shes really lookin better than usual right now. She has spells
when she dont come out of her room for days together, when she dont
even pretend to fix herself up. You think shes awful looking now; but
you just ought to see her then. She just stays shut up in that room
and dont see a soul except her canary bird, if you could call that
a soul--just for days. I dont know what in the world she does with
herself--just sits an mopes, I reckon.

But dont people go in to see her, to see whats the trouble?

Oh, she dont thank you to: shes mighty peculiar, I tell you. An
proud--_who-ee!_ Its enough to kill you with laughing, but that old
rag-bag that looks like she hadnt washed herself for a week--she
thinks herself bettern anybody in this house. Wouldnt that kill you?
Thats because she used to go out sewing for some of the grand people
here in town. Thats her trade--dressmaking.

Oh, well, then she and I ought to get along, Julie cried eagerly.
Ill go to see her. I hate to have any one look so awful.

She wont thank you an she wont see you; shell just slam the door
in your face. She seems like shes mighty suspicious of every one. She
wont have a thing to do with anybody, I tell you.

Im going to see her just the same, Julie persisted. Its awful--the
look in her face, I mean. Its like she hadnt a friend in the world.

She wont let anybody be friends with her, shes so proud an touchy,
an so peculiar. Mrs. Watkins hastened to defend the neighborliness of
the house. People aint going to put up with it. Some of the ladies
she sewed for used to come to see her and bring her things, but shes
so stand-offish even with them that theyve about quit comin.

What does she live on? Julie inquired.

Oh, she aint poor. Shes got some private means of her own. No,
maam, she aint poor.

Theres something dreadful the matter with her, Julie said
distressfully. I met her one day on the porch and looked straight into
her eyes, and I never saw anything so--so awful looking.

Well, there was a doctor once came to see her; one of the ladies
she used to sew for had him to come; an he said she was mighty bad
off; said she had some sort of melancholia, an it wasnt really safe
to have her goin round loose; said she was liable to do something
terrible.

What? What would she do? Julies eyes widened with apprehension.

I dunno. The other shook her head. Maybe kill herself, or
something.

How _awful_! Julie gasped, appalled. The poor, poor thing!

That night after supper, as they sat in the little park overhanging the
river, Julie confessed to Tim that she had told Mrs. Watkins she came
from Harts Run.

I dont know how I ever came to do such a thing, she said in a
frightened voice; I didnt mean to speak of it; I tried not to. I
tried my best to lie. An first I said Red River, but right away I
changed it to Harts Run. I had to. It seemed like Id almost slapped
my home an all the days that were gone right in the face when I said
Red River. I oughtnt to have said Harts Run--I know I oughtnt
to. Oh, do you reckon its done any harm? Do you think we ought to move
away some place else?

No--no. Its all right. I dont expect she even noticed, he comforted
her. Its all right.

She was leaning against him, and he felt a tremor of fear shiver
through her.

My little honey, its all right, he whispered, his arm tightening
round her. Its all right. Im glad you said Harts Run. I wouldnt
have had you not to. Dont get scared.

They were all alone on the lower terrace of the park. At their back
rose a steep bank. In front was the sheer drop to the river, overhung
by the wide soft spaces of the misty air. Their hands met in a tight
clasp, and for a moment they were silent in the ecstasy of their
complete trust in each other. But after a moment she spoke diffidently.

Tim, I got a notion about our--our happiness. They never spoke of it
as love. I want to tell you about it. She had fallen into a little
trick of saying eagerly, I want to tell you, or I want to tell you
all about it. And always he answered, Tell me, my little honey.

Since her mothers death there had never been any one who had really
wanted to hear what she had to say, and even her mother had not wanted
it, had not understood, in the complete way that he did. Now, because
of his understanding, her thoughts poured themselves out in a manner
that astonished her. His creative sympathy made ideals and fancies,
which heretofore had been too deep or too elusive to be expressed, come
forth fleshed in words.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the character of Mrs. Watkins and to foreshadow the conflict that Julie will face when she tries to help her.
The author achieves this by having Mrs. Watkins describe Mrs. Wheeler's appearance and behavior in negative terms. She also paints Mrs. Wheeler as a proud and difficult woman who is not likely to accept help from anyone.
