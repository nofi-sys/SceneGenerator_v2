SCENE:
XXI


MARGOT was extremely unreasonable about her change of masters; she said
she did not like Monsieur Flaubert.

It was true he agreed to teach her for a sum almost nominal. He
professed to take the deepest interest in her voice, and told her, as
Jean had never done, that she sang with the purity of a lark and the
passion of a nightingale. I do not like him, he chills my spine, she
asserted to Jean after her first lesson; and you--you do not like him
either, Jean!

This was more unreasonable of Margot still, for Jean had never admitted
even to himself that he resented Toriallis secretary, and he did not
admit it now.

He explained elaborately to Margot his reasons for esteeming Monsieur
Flaubert; they really added up very respectably, from the fact that
he had been with Torialli for ten years to his frank appreciation of
Margots golden voice.

Bah! exclaimed that young person, dress an eel in gold and he will,
still squirm! Why does he come into a room rubbing his hands? He has a
bad conscience and he looks like a cat that has stolen the cream. You
say I know nothing against him--everything is against him--I do not
like the way he does his hair!

Jean shrugged his shoulders; it was no use trying to argue with Margot;
she lived too near the sources of sensation to be easily hoodwinked by
ideas.

Jean would have liked to hoodwink her because it would have given him
company in the process in which he became daily more and more involved
of hoodwinking himself.

At last he had begun his career, but there were moments when he found
himself wondering what his career was. He was everybodys servant and
nobodys master. Music seemed to recede further and further into the
distant horizon. For days together all he had of it was the sound of
a distant piano; sometimes he was out all day, delivering notes and
seeing business people for Louis Flaubert, or Madame Torialli would ask
him to organize a little party, a day in the country, or an evening
At Home. These last occupations, however, if they were not music, had
at least about them an indefinable charm. They seemed to make Jean
indifferent to the salary that was never paid, to the extra evening
hours no one seemed to be surprised at his resigning for the general
good of the Toriallis. After all he had, as Louis often pointed out
to him, his great opportunities. He took almost all his meals in the
Boulevard Malesherbes, and he met the best people in Paris. Madame
Torialli treated him as a friend, almost as a son. Signor Torialli
treated him as a fellow musician. Jean often played at the Toriallis
At Homes; he began to have a vogue in Paris; he was called that good
little fellow at the Toriallis; and people smiled indulgently when
they mentioned him; but whether the indulgence was for Jean or for the
Toriallis never appeared. Romain met him at one of the Toriallis At
Homes. His smile seemed to have even more humour in it than usual; he
did not refer to any of his previous ideas for Jean.

So, my dear boy, he said, we meet again. You are _bien install_
here, I take it. I am so glad you have been wise and given up your
music.

But I have not, Jean cried in amazement. That is what I am here for!

Tut! tut! said his uncle. You must be jesting, Jean; every one knows
the good Toriallis have no time for the fine arts; they have only time
for receipts! Share them! Share them, my dear boy! for if you do not
you will very surely be made to pay them! There are only two ways of
getting on in this world--taking and sharing! For my own part I think
sharing is the best, the responsibility is divided, and there is
nothing I trust so greatly as a self-interest which is identical with
our own. Ah, Madame Torialli, I am congratulating my young nephew on
his position with your husband. If I were twenty years younger I should
wish I were in his place. Madame Torialli smiled very gravely and
gently; her eyes sought Jeans with an affectionate expression.

I am wondering what your uncle means, she said. And I am afraid that
it is not perhaps quite kind. I am such a simple person. And then she
looked back at Romain, who chuckled.

Twenty years ago, Madame, he said, I should have been a simple
person, too. We might then have met upon an equality.

Jean and I understand each other, said Madame, softly, preparing to
pass on to her other guests.

That is doubtless why I congratulate him, said Romain, drawing aside
to let her pass.
