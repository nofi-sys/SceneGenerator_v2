What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
In answer, he suddenly produced the _Era_ from the side of his chair,
and brought his fist down with a thump upon the unfortunate pencil-mark
by Aubrey Cookes name.

Who is this man Cooke? he asked savagely.

Annie glanced carelessly down at the paper, and said:

Mr. Aubrey Cooke? Oh, he is one of the actors whom I knew at the
Regency--one of the very actors Lilian was speaking of at dinner!

Yes, I know that very well; and you need not pretend to be so
mightily indifferent, because I know more than that, he said, with an
affectation of penetration through which Annie easily read anxiety and
curiosity.

Do you? said she, smiling. Then, if you know so much you must know
that this curious jealousy you have been cultivating lately was never
more out of place than in the case of the men I have acted with. And,
if you dont know as much as you pretend, ask Lilian.

Harry looked at her searchingly for a few minutes, and then dropped the
paper, disarmed.

She was looking so pretty in the light evening dress, with her graceful
head crowned with the coils and curls of her shining brown hair, that
he would have liked to drop his offended dignity and draw her into
his arms and kiss her. But the unconscious Annie had another blow to
inflict. She held in her arms a pile of books, and, when his face
relaxed a little after her reassuring answer, she took one up in her
hand.

I have brought you some books from Beckham, as you asked me to do,
she said. And you dont know what trouble I had in finding anything I
thought you would like. I turned over half the books on the shelves,
I think. Here is Sponges Sporting Tour, and How I Became an M. F.
H., and a book about horses, and----

She handed him a volume with her eyes still bent upon the others as she
read their titles. But she looked up startled, as he snatched it from
her and flung it with all his force against the opposite wall.

Harry! she exclaimed, amazed at the fury in his face. What have I
done now? It is impossible to please you!

Yes, because you dont care--you dont try. I am just an ignorant
boor, to be fed and clothed, and smoothed into good temper when I am
growing dangerous, and to be slighted and told lies to when I protest
against such treatment. You see I know all about it, though I am such
a clod!

She had walked to the other end of the room, picked up the book
without any show of annoyance, and was trying to restore an unruffled
appearance to the crumpled leaves. This action exasperated him still
more.

There now--it doesnt matter what I do, because its only Harry! Very
well then! There--and there--and there--and there!

At each repetition of the word he flung another of the volumes she had
incautiously placed within his reach, not at his wife, but at the wall
by which she was standing.

Really, Harry, you ought to be in a lunatic asylum! said Annie, out
of patience at last.

So I shall be very soon, if you go on treating me like a child, when I
love you like a man! burst out Harry, passionately.

His wife looked up at him, from where she was standing at the other
side of the room, in astonishment.

Yes, yes--stare at me as much as you like; I do love you, and Im not
the fool you think me, except in caring for you! Do you think I dont
know that you look down upon me, and that everybody thinks you thrown
away upon me? Why, I knew that in the old days when I first married
you; but then you just avoided me, and I didnt care. But now you come
back, pretty and bright and charming, not cold and shy as you used to
do, you flutter about me and nurse me and coax me into good-humor, and
make me laugh and get me to do everything you wish; and then, when
I want to show you I love you for it, you shut me off with a little
laugh, just to show me that I am only Harry, and whatever I say and
whatever I do doesnt matter. I say it is cruel, wicked, and, however
good and clever you may be, you are treating me badly! he ended, his
voice breaking down.

Harry! was all his astonished wife could utter.

I know Im not a companion for you, he went on, but you dont want
me to be, you wont understand that I want to be. I asked you to get
me some books; but I wanted books that you liked, so that I might read
them and talk to you about them, like William and George. And then you
bring me a lot of sporting trash, as if I wasnt fit for anything but
the stable!
