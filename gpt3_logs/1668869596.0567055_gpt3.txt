SCENE:
Work went on as usual; not that, in this doomed ship, painting and
scrubbing were necessary, but to keep the crew's minds off the danger
and the formulating of futile plans and suggestions--which always
comes of idleness. But in spite of this, mutterings of discontent were
heard, and in the interests of peace, I abolished all work except the
continuous washing down of the hot deck, night and day. And at this
monotonous work men would go to sleep in their tracks, waking when they
fell over.

I had long noticed the peculiar mental effect of the jute smoke
on myself, at first a tendency to day-dreams and a lazy, sleepy
indifference to our danger; later a trancelike condition in which
voices were not heard, or if heard not noticed, and the whole inner
consciousness busy with serene contemplation of the past, the present,
and the future, mingled with visions of green trees and flowers, sounds
of tinkling water, and music that seemed not of earth.

All this brought no misgiving to my mind until I wakened, prone upon
the blistering deck one night, with no recollection of my falling. Then
I regarded it as serious, and in the morning spoke to the captain.

"Yes, we must quit," he said mournfully, "while we have our senses.
It is the soporific principle of the jute, akin to that of hasheesh,
which is made from Indian hemp. No one could sleep below without that
continuous narcotic, and such sleep is dangerous. I had trouble waking
you yesterday. Capsize the boats and provision them. The ship may
burst into flames at any moment, and when she does, she'll go quickly.
She's dry as a chip."

We numbered about thirty, all told, and to accommodate this many we had
three good boats, upside down on the forward house. These I soon had
over the side, floating light upon the smooth sea at the ends of their
painters, and we provisioned them as heavily as was safe with our added
weight. When all was ready I reported.

"And none too soon," answered the captain. "Look there!" He pointed
forward, where the tarpaulin of the main hatch had lifted like a great
bubble from the pressure of hot air and gases beneath. "There is
dunnage under the hatch and it is afire, Mr. Morton," he said, turning
to our passenger, "you and your sister will go in the boat with me. I
will bring her up when I bring my papers."

I had no mind for this. I turned away, and while directing the manning
of the boats, did some deep and desperate thinking. Put her in an open
boat with a lunatic brother and a doddering old skipper, I fumed? Not
much.

As the men swarmed down, Grace appeared in the forward companion. I
beckoned to her, and she came. We had already rigged a whip from the
fore yardarm, and in a "bosun's chair" at the end of this I quickly
hoisted her over the side and into my boat. George, leaving his sister
to the captain's care, had descended to his boat on the other side.
When all were over but the captain and myself, the former appeared on
deck.

"Where is Miss Morton?" he called. "I cannot find her."

"In the boat, captain," I truthfully yelled. "Hurry up, sir. There's no
time to lose."

I pointed, as he had done, to the main hatch. The bubble had burst,
and up from the rent rose a column of smoke.

"Go ahead, sir," he answered. "I must be last."

I clambered down the side, and joined Grace in the sternsheets.

"Where is George?" she asked. "I thought he was coming, and the
captain, too."

"Both in the starboard boat," I answered. "You're in here with me,
where I can take care of you. Shove off!" I commanded. "Both boats
shove off, and get away from here."

The second mate had charge of the other boat, and together we shot
away from the ship, putting a hundred yards between us before pausing
to wait for the captain's boat from the other side. But it did not
appear at once. Instead, we heard loud shouts, and the name "Grace" in
Morton's tremulous voice.

"Miss Morton is here," I sang out, but, if heard, I was not answered.

Then the shouts ceased, and Morton's figure appeared on the opposite
rail.

"Grace!" he called. "Grace, where are you?"

"I'm here, George," she answered. "I'm safe. Save yourself."

"Here!" I bellowed. "Here with me! Get back into your boat."
