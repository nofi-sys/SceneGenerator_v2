Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
It must be hushed up. And you must find out the boy and bring him back
to me. If--if I were well, it might be different; but I must forgive
him now. You will find him out, George?

Yes, father.

Sir George lay back again in silence; but his face was still very
stern; there was remorse for his own conduct as well as shame for his
ill-brought-up sons in the expression it wore.

George went up to town the next day, and fulfilled the first part of
his fathers commission, that relating to the check, without much
difficulty; but he failed to find a clew to his brothers hiding-place,
if he were in hiding, which George doubted. It was more characteristic
of the Braithwaites to do wrong and brave the consequences openly; and
this course, while apparently favoring detection, often proved the
safest.

Then a suggestion occurred to him for tracking the runaway. He wrote
to Mrs. Mainwaring for the address of Miss Lanes aunt, and, on the
day he received it, he knocked in the afternoon at the door of a very
small semi-detached house a few miles out of London. The door had
figured glass let into it in place of the upper panels, and he saw a
face pressed against one of these in doubtful contemplation of him some
minutes after his second ring. His hand was on the bell for the third
time, when the door was opened, and a little servant with a very small
and very dirty face asked what he wanted. He had not got further than
to ask doubtfully if Mrs. Mansfield lived there when she turned round
and abruptly left him standing at the entrance of the most pretentious
hall, for its size, that he had ever seen. For it was esthetically
papered, and had an inappropriate dado, while a pair of ugly China
monsters left scarcely room for the stranger to pass between them and
the umbrella-stand. It was so small that he could distinctly hear the
conversation which followed in the backyard.

Its a gentleman, maam, who wants to see you--such a nice gentleman,
in a great long coat!

Did you show him into the drawing-room?

No, maam.

Show him in at once, and then you hang up the rest of the stockings.
Say I will be with him in a minute, and take the pin out of my gown
behind. Then, in a severe tone, You dirty little thing, you are not
fit to speak to a visitor! And indeed this domestic did not harmonize
well with the dado.

The small servant showed George into a tiny room, the furniture and
arrangement of which told more of its owners history than the hall
had done. For it was a room which belonged to an anterior period of
civilization. The carpet was of the aggressive kind, with old fashioned
impossibly-colored roses. There was an inlaid round table, much too
big for the room, jutting a long way out of one corner; the piano was
worn and old-fashioned, the chairs were evidently relics of two or
three different suits of furniture. The books were suggestive too--the
Pilgrims Progress, with much gilt on the binding, odd numbers of
the _Sunday at Home_, and the current number of the _Quiver_, two or
three _Keepsakes_, some little-used volumes of miscellaneous poetry,
which looked like school-prizes, _et cetera_. But the ornaments spoke
more plainly than anything in the room--large, blue-glass vases on the
mantel-piece, crochet antimacassars, each of a different pattern, over
the chairs; and every ornament stood on a wool mat.

He had to wait some time; he heard Mrs. Mansfield go softly past the
door and up the stairs, and the small servant follow her with hot
water, as he could tell by her spilling it as she went along. Presently
the door opened, and a woman of about forty, dressed in rusty black,
much covered by trimmings which enhanced the shabbiness they were meant
to hide, came in and apologized more than was necessary.

He stated the object of his visit as soon as he could. He had come on
behalf of his mother and some other friends of Miss Lane, to find out
her address.

I could not have given it you myself before this morning, said Mrs.
Mansfield. She has written twice to me since she left Garstone; but
it was only in the letter I received to-day from her that she put any
address. She is lodging in London by herself, and trying to get daily
pupils.

Are you going to see her? asked George.

No, I have no time; she knows that herself, and doesnt expect me.

Do you approve of her plan of living by herself? It seems a strange
one for such a young girl.

Indeed Annie doesnt trouble herself about my approval. I cant say I
think it a proper thing for a girl to do who has been brought up like
Annie; but she is so obstinate--just like her mother, my poor sister.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

George goes to London to find his runaway brother, but instead finds Miss Lane's aunt. The aunt tells George that Miss Lane is living in London by herself and trying to get daily pupils. George is surprised by this news and wonders if it is a proper thing for a young girl to do.
