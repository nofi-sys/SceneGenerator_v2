SCENE:
"I am sorry. It will not do. I need a mate who can stand watch, command
the men--for I have a hard crowd--and keep the log."

"I can command the men, if you're thinking of me; but I never saw a
log."

"And your friend?"

"A graduate navigator from Annapolis," spoke up Fred. "But I never
commanded men."

"You will do. The laws of insurance demand that the first mate be a
navigator. You two men must stand trial for manslaughter at the next
port. Will you sail to that port as officers of my ship, or do you
prefer to remain in irons?"

We gladly chose the former, and gave our words of honor not to attempt
an escape at the end of the passage. Thus secured, the captain made
me second mate, and Fred first mate, and as he unlocked our irons
promised to give us his sympathy and testimony at the trial. For he had
witnessed the tormenting of Fred by the second mate, and had verified
my protest of noncombativeness.

So Fred, an untried boy of twenty, with only a book-taught knowledge
of navigation and seamanship, assumed the duties of first officer in a
two-thousand-ton, square-rigged ship, in place of a man I had killed;
and I, a schooner second mate, stepped into a like position in this
big square-rigger. In place of the man he had disabled--both of us
prisoners under the law--for the simple reason that among the crew no
others were in any way capable.

I do not say that I assumed my new duties without misgivings at the
future, or that I wholly justified myself _to_ myself in regard to my
killing the mate; but I won the skipper's approval at once; and, as
Fred got the whiskey out of him, slept well in my watch below, seeing
neither monsters nor _things_.

For a few days, Fred was more of a third mate than a first, as the
skipper stood watch with him, until, under his tutelage, Fred had
mastered the merchant-ship rig. Then he proved competent, and the men,
respecting his position, if not him, gave him no trouble.

He and I agreed very well. I was more amused than irritated at his
quarter-deck airs; and a quiet hint from the skipper that I study up
on navigation, with the loan of an "Epitome," a nautical almanac, and
an old log book, gave promise that our positions might some time be
reversed. And, so adjusted, we sailed out into the broad Atlantic.

So far I have said nothing of the weather. As a fact, it blew a gale
from the west or northwest continually from the first day out until we
hit the Gulf Stream, by which time, though fair, the wind forced us to
heave the ship to--that is, to bring her up on the starboard tack under
short sail. We performed the maneuver successfully, and the darkness
had come when the gear was coiled up, and the watch sent below. The
ship took it easily, plunging up and down in the same hole, and taking
very little water on board. But the change from the long, swinging
heave and roll of a ship running free, to the short, jerky lifts and
dives of a ship hove to, was too sudden for the steward in the cabin.
I had the deck, and from my position in the weather alley could hear
the crashing of dishes sent to the floor, and the scraping and bumping
of cabin furniture. Also, I heard a scream, and wondered if Fred had
the jumps again; but before I could even speculate on the matter, the
after companion opened, and the steward appeared, his face twisting
in excitement. He was German, and he stammered; and, while wondering
what he had on his mind, as he endeavored to speak, I noticed a cloud
of smoke floating away to leeward from one of the lee cabin windows. I
sprang aft to the steward, and he found voice.

"Fire!" he said explosively. "Der lamp f-f-fell der t-t-t-table off."

"Call all hands forward there," I sang out. "Bring the deck pump aft,
and bear a hand." Then I tumbled down into the smoke-filled after
cabin, followed by the steward.

"In der s-s-s-storeroom," he stammered.

"Where's the captain?" I asked, as I groped my way through the smoke.

"Der c-c-cappen is fall down by der storeroom," he answered.

A stifled scream came out of the smoke, and a slim figure in a dressing
gown staggered into view, falling helplessly into my arms. It was a
girl, and by the dim light from the swinging lamp above, I saw that she
was young, pale, and sweet of face.

"In God's name, what's this?" I said. "Here, steward, take her on deck;
then come back, and get something warm to cover her."

He took the fainting girl from me, and went up the companion. Then I
sought my way through the choking fumes to the door leading into the
forward cabin, off which was the steward's storeroom. Taking a good
breath of the best air available--near the floor--I plunged through and
stumbled over a prostrate body.
