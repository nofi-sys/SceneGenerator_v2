SCENE:
X


The party of four started for the embassy on foot, taking their way
to where the Charlottenburg Drive cut straight through the noble
Thiergarten to the Branderberger Thor and the streets of old Berlin. A
few yards from the zoological garden the dazzle of the lamps died away,
and only the big stars, flaring in the heavens, lighted the broad white
road.

Divining the Americans wish to exchange reminiscences, Lord Maxwell
and his daughter stepped ahead, leaving the other two to follow.

The wind was rustling through the leaves; the air was damp but warm
and languorous; the night seemed made for sentiment. Topham felt it
and wondered what Miss Byrd expected him to say. Not knowing, he said
nothing.

Miss Byrd, however, either did not feel sentimental or preferred to
take another way to show it. Well, Walter, she began, I suppose I
ought to ask about everybody and then you ought to ask about everybody
and by the time we have learned all about everybody, we should be at
the embassy saying good-night, without either of us knowing anything
we really wanted to know. So suppose we take everybodys health for
granted and talk of things we really care about.

Topham started. This girl was not the Lillian Byrd he had known.
Bright, witty, and attractive she yet seemed to him almost a stranger.
Perhaps, he pondered, it was because he no longer loved her, and
yet--and yet--the Lillian Byrd he had known of old had possessed a
very special air of refinement--one bringing memories of lavender and
stately homes and dear old-fashioned ladies, while this girl seemed
hardened, metallic, with a laugh that tinkled out of tune. He was
silent, not knowing what to say.

Miss Byrd noticed his hesitation and attributed it instantly to the
right cause.

You think Im changed, dont you? she demanded. Oh! you neednt
trouble to deny it! I _am_ changed. Goodness knows Ive had enough to
change anybody. You didnt know that I was that dreadful thing--a lady
journalist--did you? I am! Im on the New York Gazette.

Good Heavens! You--you dont mean that you are corresponding for
Risdons paper. How in the world--

Thats what I mean. Ive been doing it for two years, and working for
the Gazette is mighty hard on refinement. I can pretend still if the
atmosphere is right. I havent forgotten the old airs and graces, and
I put them on at times--when I go back to Washington to see dear Aunt
Polly or when--well, tonight, for instance, when I had an object. But
they dont fit any more, Mr. Topham; they dont fit!

There was a tremble in the girls voice that suggested tears and made
Topham feel acutely uncomfortable. The darkness hid his distress while
he sought unreadily for some response and found none.

Nor did the girl speak again at once. In silence the two walked on
through the fragrant night, the massed foliage rising on either side, a
network against the sky. Here and there white statues gleamed, ghostly
in the darkness, and at long intervals a street lamp cast a circle of
yellow light. From off to the right came the noise of running water
and the distant creak of oars or of cordage as some huge barge crept
slowly along the invisible Spree. Now and then an electric car swept
brilliantly along the drive.

At last the girl, with an obvious attempt at flippancy, spoke again.

The new style comes easy to me, she said; so easy that I guess it
must be nearer my real self than the older one you used to know. I like
it, though I know I ought to be ashamed of it. I look back on the old
days as--as a divorce looks back on her first honeymoon, I suppose--as
a mighty pleasant time but not for her any more.

But--but why--

Dont you know. Hadnt you heard about father? Really? Well, he lost
his place in the War Department and then the panic came along and took
his money; and then his health failed; and it was up to sister Eleanor
and poor silly me to look after him and Aunt Polly. There was nobody
else to do it, you see. Sister Eleanor got a job as social secretary
to one of those wild western senators, but nobody seemed to want yours
truly. I couldnt get a Government post because dad had been in the
service so long that he had lost his residence in Kentucky, and of
course nobody from the District has a chance for appointment. So at
last it came down to a choice between seeing dad and Aunt Polly suffer
and becoming a reportress--how I used to loathe them! Mr. McNew liked
my style and sent me over to write up Europe six months ago. Ive lived
and dad has had some comforts and I dont think Europe has suffered
much. Anyway, its got to take its chance. I made friends with Lady
Ellen in England, and she invited me to visit her in Berlin, and here I
am. They like me because I am so American--when I want to be.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the characters of Lillian Byrd and Walter Topham, and to set up the conflict between them. The author achieves this by having Lillian Byrd reveal her new, more hardened personality to Topham, who is clearly uncomfortable with the change.
