SCENE:
By the evening of Friday, October 24th, 1913, everything was ready for
my departure.

My clothes were packed in a big, new trunk. A smaller one held my books.
I hadn't the heart to throw away any of the poor friendly things I had
accumulated in my lodgings, the relics of three years of joyless toil. I
had it all properly packed in the old box which had been my mother's,
not forgetting my uniform of an officer of the Reserve, already shabby
with two periods of training--poor officers are never slow to avail
themselves of these extra trainings. I took it to the station myself and
dispatched it addressed to the old cur with whom I stayed in my
vacations.

At five o'clock I had finished a letter telling him of my new start in
life. I had settled up my affairs. I had rather more than 2,300 francs
left, allowing for ten louis I had been glad to lend Ribeyre. I decided
to send the same amount to my old cur for his crumbling church among
the dunes.

When I had posted my letter in the Rue de Tournon, I made my way to
Luxemburg. I passed the white Medici Fountain, where I had so often
waited for the nymphs of my dreams. The sentry was sheltering out of
sight in his box. The great Royal garden had never been so deserted as
on this evening when autumn felt the first touch of winter. Beneath the
bare trees, under a darkening golden sky, the cold circle of queens on
their marble pedestals showed strangely white in the falling light.

The clock of the Senate struck half-past five. The silence of death
reigned in the heart of Paris. The fountains had ceased to play and the
great octagonal basin spread its mirror, clearer--by some miracle--than
the sky itself. A man, the only man beside myself in the famous garden,
was standing at the edge in the curious attitude of a man sowing seeds.
He was throwing bread to the birds. There were some three dozen
sparrows, and fat grey pigeons, gawky, restless birds. He was an old man
in a seedy black coat with the remains of a fur collar. There was a bag
at his feet. I went up and the birds flew away. The old fellow cast me
a reproachful glance, threw his bag over his shoulder and shambled off.
When I left the garden myself it was quite dark.

Four hours later I caught the Paris-Berlin express at the Gare de l'Est.




II


The clear, cold star which had been shining in the steel blue sky had
disappeared.

Vignerte started. "What time is it?"

I lit my electric torch. "Ten minutes to twelve," I said.

I awakened the two runners.

"Henriquez, go to the third section, tell the adjutant to see to the
relief of the second platoon and report to Lieutenant Vignerte.
Damestoy, go to the second section and tell the section officer to do
the same for the first platoon. He mustn't forget the two o'clock
patrol. It will be supplied by the eleventh squad, Corporal Toulet. Got
that? Come, look sharp!"

The two men climbed out. For two seconds the patch of blue sky was
hidden.

A weird, soundless night. A stray rifle shot at long intervals. The guns
silent.

Vignerte resumed his story.


HAVE you ever read _Baron von Heidenstamm_? Meyer Forster has borrowed
something for it from Tolstoy--the whole chapter on the race for the
Emperor's Cup is taken from Anna Karenina--and a good deal,
unfortunately, from our Octave Feuillet. Still, you shouldn't miss the
description of Hanover, life in a German garrison town, and the royal
park in snow. The impressions you get are very much what I felt on my
arrival at Lautenburg at ten o'clock on the morning of Sunday, October
26th, 1913.

For the previous eight hours I had been watching the gradual
displacement of the Walpurgis Harz, shrouded to the south in
copper-coloured clouds by a fertile but ugly, featureless plain. When
the train had crossed the Aller the country became more undulating.
Foaming in its basaltic bed appeared the winding river Melna which joins
the Aller some forty miles below Lautenburg. I was nearing my
destination.

The sky was dull and grey. The town, clinging to the slopes of a hill in
a bend of the Melna, had a certain resemblance to Pau, or, rather,
Saint-Gaudens, thanks to its red-brick houses. Crowning all, in a
distant clump of trees, I saw an old tower. The Castle, I thought.
