SCENE:
VIII

FLIGHT

Fear of the night, the unknown prowlers in the heather, the escape of
the schoolmaster, and above all the danger to his paper, held Rob in
a breathless silence.

And all the time Muckle John was walking towards him, whistling
softly as he came.  Passing a few yards to the left of the fallen
tree behind which Rob was crouching he halted suddenly, and then in a
leisurely fashion seated himself on the trunk of it, with the tails
of his coat almost touching Rob's cheek.

For long enough he remained with his elbows upon his knees staring
out upon the loch, and yet Rob never stirred, biding his time.  At
last with a profound sigh Muckle John began to speak to himself in a
low, musing voice, like a man troubled about something and doubtful
about the course he should take.

"Poor Rob," he said, "where has he got to now?"  Upon which he sighed
again and shook his head.  "I doubt," he murmured, "that they've
taken him--for he no answered my bit whistle.  He would have answered
had he heard, for he promised me, and Rob's no the lad to go back
upon his word--oh no, you'd never suspect Rob of that," and he paused
in a heart-breaking manner as though emotion had fairly overcome him.
As for Rob, it was all he could do not to spring up and catch him by
the hands; but he lay like a stone, utterly miserable, hating the
paper and his wretched suspicions.

"Besides," continued Muckle John more briskly, "I saved the laddie's
life, and glad to do it.  Oh, no, no; dinna tell me that Rob heard
the whistle and ran his neck into the noose I was calling him from.
Poor Rob," said he again, "I doubt but he's laid by the heels by this
time."

Then he stirred a little and began to button his coat.

"I must save Rob," said he in a mighty determined tone, and at that
the boy touched him softly on the coat.

"Muckle John," he whispered.

The man beside him started violently, and came near to falling off
the log altogether, so great appeared to be his astonishment.  But
with an effort at recovery he pushed Rob back.

"Down," he whispered, in Gaelic, "down for your life," and he began
to stretch himself as though he had fallen to sleep.  "Rob," he
murmured at last, "I hope ye did na hear my vapourings."

"I fear I did," replied Rob.

"Well, well, there's no harm where no ill was spoken.  But I was
hurt, ye ken, that you did not heed my whistle.  Speak low, Rob, for
there's been a man behind yon tuft o' heather for the last half-hour."

"I was feared," said Rob, "Ephraim Macaulay was loosed and oh--Muckle
John, I..."

"No suspected me, surely?" he gasped.

"I was feared, ye see, and..."

But Muckle John shook his head, and fell into a soliloquy in Lowland
Scots.

"Oh, Rob, Rob," he said, "this is no pleasant hearing.  It makes
things difficult.  I'm minded to leave ye, Rob, though I shrink frae
doing so, for the country is fair hotching with spies and sic' like,
and at this present moment, there's a wheen men with eyes fair glued
to this spot, and all o' them just hungering for the dawn.  It's a
dangerous ploy ye're engaged upon, Rob, and one beside which Culloden
was as snug as snaring rabbits," and he sighed again with his eyes up
on the loch.

"Rob," he broke out suddenly, "it's enough to mak' me die with shame
when I say it, but it's Macaulay ye think I loosed.  Come then, Rob,
and follow me, and I swear on the naked dirk I'll show ye Macaulay,"
and sliding through the undergrowth, he beckoned back to him.  In
this manner taking advantage of every scrap of cover, they reached
the wood where the mist was rising before the dawn.

At this point Muckle John advanced very cautiously upon his hands and
feet, and Rob marvelled at so large a man moving as softly as a cat.
Of a sudden, however, he dropped upon his stomach and waggled his
foot as a warning.  For men's voices in muttered Gaelic came from
behind a rock immediately to their right.

"He cannot have left the shore, Angus," said one, "for Neil is
watching the brae and we will close in on him at sunrise.  Besides,
he is only a boy."
