SCENE:
A bang--in that silence as loud as a cannon shot--a rending burst of
light, waked him. He leaped to his feet his senses scattered, not
knowing where he was or what had happened. Then from every side of
the house noise broke, groans, screams, slamming of doors, thudding
footfalls. It was terrifying in the darkness, like a company of ghosts
wailing and running about in some black inferno. Williams voice
shouted the first intelligible words:

You got them--good work! Where the hell are the lights?

That shook Shine into consciousness, and he called to the gallery
whence a patter of bare feet and shrill female cries rose:

Its all right. Dont be scared. Its only a flashlight.

Male voices followed, harsh and loud as the men came rushing in:

Rawsons from the left with the crash of the door flung back against
the wall.

What are you doing in here? What was that?

Bassetts from the entrance, his body colliding with furniture as he
ran blindly forward. Somewhere in the darkness behind, Stokes high and
choked, breaking into curses. And over all Miss Pinkneys riding the
tumult like the war cry of the Valkyries:

Why dont some of you fools turn on the electricity? The buttons on
the right side of the door.

Bassetts hand found it and the room was flooded with light.

The women in straight white nightgowns stood on the gallery huddled
together. The dreadful darkness lifted, they leaned over the railing,
their faces pallid between hanging locks of hair, dropping a shower of
questions on the men below. One of them was hysterical and gave forth a
sobbing wail, and Williams shouted with angry authority:

Keep quiet up there. Nothings the matter. Didnt you hear it was a
flashlight?

Some one strangled a scream--Williams thought it was Flora but could
not be sure. Then they made a simultaneous retreat to the bedrooms for
negliges and slippers, while the men, gathered round Shine, listened
to his explanation. No, hed seen nothing and heard nothing, but hed
got the picture all right, whoever it was, he had them. Now hed go
and develop it--he could do that in a few minutes--and there was the
projector in the corner he could use, throw it on to something where
theyd all see. A sheet over that screen by the desk would do. And when
its on there, large as life, there wont be any use lying, therell be
nothing for it but to come across.

They urged him out, theyd attend to everything: hurry up with
the picture. Williams was unable to hide his elation. His idea,
augmented by Shines, was a bulls-eye hit, and his voice showed an
exultant excitement as he called to Miss Pinkney to bring a sheet.
Rawsons satisfaction was less apparent, but his eye was alight with
anticipation. If it was the boy, he had run back up-stairs, for no exit
had been attempted through the kitchen. With the whole house astir
hed be afraid to come down and they had him safe as a rat in a trap.
Impatient at the wait for Shines reappearance he left the room, saying
he was going to the boat-house for a word with Patrick.

Bassett saw him go and made no move--he could not leave Anne now. The
detonation and fire-work illumination that had made him leap for the
path had roused Patrick. As he ran, not knowing what had taken place
in the house, he had heard the mans grunt of returning consciousness
and a hoarse expletive thrown into the night. Rawson would find him
awake and his dereliction never be known. But this mattered nothing to
Bassett. An inner anguish held him; his eyes and Annes had met as she
stood on the gallery and for the despair in hers he had no consolation.
He saw Miss Pinkney and Williams pulling out the screen and draping
it with a sheet, he saw Stokes walking stiffly to a chair, his hands
curved over its back, his face a curious shining white--he saw and
his mind registered nothing. If it was Joe, if it was Joe--what would
become of her, what could he do?

The noise of the womens footsteps on the stairs came in a descending
rush. They burst in, their voices going before them, a scattering of
gasped explosive utterances.

Flora went to Stokes and caught at his arm. What is it, what is it?
she kept repeating, jerking at his arm, till he started away from her
pushing her off.

Williams heard and answered with veiled gusto. Some one had been
walking about the house at night against orders. It had been important
to find out who was doing it and so Mr. Shine had set his camera
and caught them, him or her--Williams voice was heavy on the last
pronoun--in a flashlight picture. Mr. Shine was developing it now and
as soon as he was ready theyd see it thrown on the sheet.
