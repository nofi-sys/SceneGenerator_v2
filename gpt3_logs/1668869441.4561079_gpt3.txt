Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
"They call silence the negation of sound," he continued, "as they
call darkness the negation of light. There is polarity throughout the
universe. We are aware of plus and minus quantities in mathematics,
each calculable by the same methods.

"We know of the north and south poles of the magnet; we know of
positive and negative electricity; we know, by the expansion of gases,
that there is a force the opposite of gravitation, and which repels
instead of attracts. Some theorists have called this force apergy. I
believe that all these negative forces exist, but only in the presence,
or because of the existence, of their opposites. For I know that cold,
which, more than all other conditions, may seem to be a mere negation,
will answer to the laws of other radiant energy, and, like heat,
decrease in force as the square of the distance."

I looked stupidly at him, then at Old Bill, who, no more stupid than
myself under this avalanche of erudition, was puttering about, cleaning
up the studio. Not noticing my bewilderment, the old artist went on.

"But an iceberg," he said, "is too large to be cognized by the law of
inverse squares. It would need a diaphragm bigger than itself--bigger
than the largest ship, to collect its radiations of cold. Could it
be reduced to a point, however, and its cold concentrated, we could
calculate its distance and direction, at least, if not its size. You
know the nature of a searchlight, do you not?"

He looked at me now, and, trying to bring an intelligent expression to
my face, I nodded.

"An arc light in the focus of a parabolic reflector placed behind it,"
he continued. "Stand in the path of its beam and you will sensibly feel
the heat. Place a large lens--as large as the aperture--in the way, and
focus the beam on yourself, and you will feel a heat equal to that of
the arc light--about seven thousand degrees Fahrenheit--less what has
radiated into the surrounding air.

"Now, get out of that focus, and place an opaque disk on the center
of the searchlight aperture, and the beam will go forth with a dark
center, like a hollow pipe of light and heat. And this dark center will
have the temperature of the outer air, plus only what has radiated into
it from the surrounding pipe.

"But after passing through the lens both the light and the dark center
will reach the same focus, and if you can place a thermometer, without
burning yourself, near the focus of the dark core, you will notice
a great drop in the temperature. So, you see, cold, while negative
heat, is a minus quantity; but it needs the presence of heat to make it
respond to the same laws that govern heat."

He paused for a moment, then looked at me; and this time I could not
conceal the vacuous expression on my face. He smiled, then turned to
Old Bill.

"Bill," he said, "what do you think about it? Do you think all gases
will ultimately be solidified as they are now liquefied? Do you think
the absolute zero of space can be determined by any application of the
integral or the differential calculus?"

In answer to this whimsical question Bill said: "I dunno, sir. I can't
calcilate. I jess 'member I washed the windows an' swept up an' dusted.
D'ye want me in the mornin', sir?"

"No, Bill. If you're through, that'll do to-night."

"I'll want you, Bill," I interposed, as the old fellow started for the
door. "Come at nine o'clock, and wear your oldest, raggedest clothes."

"Yes, sir," answered Bill, and departed.

"It's the last figure in the picture," I added quickly, to forestall a
resumption of the harrowing lecture on matters I did not understand.
"And it will be done about noon. I'll be glad if you will come in and
look it over."

"Most certainly," said my friend. "Been a long time at it, haven't you?"

"Yes; but I didn't want to bother you until it was done. I want to be
original, if I can, and depend on my own conceptions."

"That's right. Be yourself. I'll be in at noon, and look at it."

I _had_ been a long time on that picture, in conception, composition,
and execution; and it had followed a longer time of inactivity, during
which I had done nothing in the way of work except to search my soul
for an idea. At last it had come to me, and I had made sketches, one
after the other, until, in composition, it was complete; then I had
painted it.

Still, there lacked a motive. It was a picture, but it told no story
intelligible to the eye without an explanatory title, and I had
not yet thought of a title. The scene was on the deck of a ship--a
flush-deck, polacca-masted craft, a type of rig I had seen but once
in my travels--and the viewpoint was at the break of the poop,
looking forward. The fore and mainsail were clewed up, hanging in the
buntlines, and the flying jib was down a-bag on the jib-boom end.


BRIEF OUTLINE:

==========

- protagonist has been working on a painting for a long time, but it is still missing a key element
- he is visited by a friend, who he hopes will be able to provide some inspiration
- the friend takes one look at the painting and points out that it needs a title in order to make sense
- the protagonist is stumped, and the friend leaves
- protagonist continues to work on the painting, and finally comes up with a title that he likes
