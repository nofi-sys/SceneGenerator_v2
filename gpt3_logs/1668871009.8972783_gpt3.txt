SCENE:
So long, said Daily. The heats up.

Hold on! Murphy held him by the arm and spoke rapidly. Listen to me.
A delegate sits in a pow-wow to talk for the people what sends him;
aint that right? An if they sends him to salt a man, and he supports
him, why hes playin em all for good tings!

Daily turned away. Youse give me a pain, sneered he, over his
shoulder.

They watched him as he took his place at the rolls. Huge tongs running
upon trolleys, were shoved into the gaping maws of the furnaces and
each emerged gripping a white-hot mass of metal. A jarring concussion
rang through the building; it was the first of these being passed
through the rolls, and its scattering scales made even the hardened
passers flinch. Report followed report; the darkness had vanished
before the lurid glare; the heat of the place became blistering. Amid
the blinding flashes and the serpentlike bars that crawled about the
floor, the men worked furiously, like heat-maddened demons, engaged in
some dread incantation.

Then they turned and walked away. Larrys face worked with rage;
McGonagle walked gloomily along at his side, his hands stuffed into his
pockets, his head bent dejectedly.

Weve got it where we live, said the latter. It was all serene till
we heard o this, and if hes goin to vote for Kelly, why we cant
stop him, thats all; we cant do nawthin.

Tell we cant! cried the enraged Murphy. Say, looket here, Goose;
one hour after Tim Daily says yea for Kelly hell be in St. Marys
done up in splints! Hes played crooked with us people, aint that
right? And well git even if we have to tump him. Ah!

They walked along for a time, in silence.

Are ye goin to see the other lobster? questioned Goose.

Lets go over to the Dutchmans, hit a bracer and talk tings over,
first. Ive got cobwebs in me head an I want to brush em away. The
motzer kin wait till daylight.

The saloon was the only all-night establishment in the neighbourhood.
It glittered with clusters of electric lamps and broad, gilt-framed
mirrors; a marble-topped bar backed by pyramids of glasses and bottles
stood upon one side.

They talked in a desultory way for some time, consuming much beer and
many plates of sandwiches. Dawn stretched a grey hand through the
window and dimmed the clusters of lights; and when they ranged along
the bar for the last drink, the streets were filling with people
hurrying toward their work.

Then they tramped off toward the spreading Hebrew settlement on North
Second Street. Levitsky, the man whom they sought, while he claimed
a voting place in the ward, really lived south of the line, in one
of the row of houses that face the old market sheds. These teem with
long-coated, huge-bearded Russian Jews, who drag their stock in trade
upon the sidewalk each morning and prowl up and down before it watching
for customers, and hoarsely shouting in a mixture of English and
Yiddish.

Larry and his chum paused before a dirty bulk window heaped with odds
and ends of merchandise; on a stand upon the sidewalk lay little
stacks of Yiddish newspapers and pamphlets; a thin, yellow-faced man,
in a round, high-crowned cap, and with a beard of patriarchal length,
sat in the doorway twisting a cigarette out of some damp tobacco. He
was a wise man in the Ghetto, learned in the law and a public reader
of the scrolls; he knew the ways of Gentile youth when it was half
drunken, for he drew his long coat about his gaunt frame as they
approached, and raised his hand to prevent the expected plucking at his
beard.

Wheres Levitsky? asked Larry.

The man in the velvet cap gestured his relief and called shrilly to
someone within. A girl came out; a dark-eyed, deep-breasted girl, the
perfect type of Jewess.

Levitskys gone down to get his breakfast at Sams, said she.

Much obliged, said Larry. Come on, Goose.

Down the street a scarlet lettered sign flamed conspicuously among a
wilderness of others, and thither they hurried and entered at the door
over which it hung. The revolving fans drove the hot, strong-odoured
breath of the place into their faces; waiters, greasy aproned and
perspiring, rushed about dexterously balancing pyramids of food-filled
crockery; the room resounded with shouted orders and the incessant
ringing of the cash register.
