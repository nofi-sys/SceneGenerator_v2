Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
No, of course, Seora, Hi said. I dont ask you to lend him. I want
to hire him.

How much you pay?

How much do you want, for the two days?

What you pay?

What do you usually charge?

How much you pay? I cant be buyer and seller, too.

I dont know how much these things cost in this country, Hi said.

Well, what you give, see?

Hi produced his peseta notes and small change, to which the woman made
an emphatic gesture that this was childs play.

Well, how much, then? Hi asked.

A tall, lean man had come silently into the room behind Hi; he had taken
up his position facing Hi, with his back against the table. He was
picking his teeth with a sprig of macilente, which he chewed. Hi did not
like the fellows looks. He had almost no brow; his hair and eyebrows
merged into each other. Under this shag, the mans eyes were very black;
his face was hungry-looking, with pale, sunken cheeks. The mouth was
greedy-looking or wolfish, although it split into a smile over the
toothpick. The teeth glittered; they looked evil, being pointed and
inclined inward, something like snakes fangs. His ear-rings glittered
at each bite upon the sprig. There was a glittering about the mans
person, apart from ear-rings and teeth, because his waistcoat was
buttoned up to the throat with some thirty small globular silver
buttons.

All is not gold that glitters, Hi thought. Mr. Bright Tooth, you look
like a wolf who would scratch up a grave.

Well, how much, do you think, would be fair for a horse for two days?
Hi asked.

The woman fanned herself for a moment, then she said:

You see, we not know you. You may be very fine gentleman, but we not
know you. My horse, all the horse I got. You want to go to Anselmo? That
fifty kilometre, forty kilometre from here through the forest; pumas in
the forest; eat horses; then you go over the fords; the fords all out
with rain. Very like you get my horse drowned. Then you not know how to
look out. You get the horse bitten by snakes, or else you lose your way.
Then suppose you reach Anselmo. You say, that old woman, pah, she not
want her horse. I got to Anselmo, what the hell, see? How I to know you
send the horse back?

I promise you I will.

Promise. Look. Im a woman: see? I dont believe any promise any man
ever make. When a man want a thing, he promise anything. Does he pay?
Nit, I dont think; with the fore sheet, what? So dont promise me
nothing, Albert; its pretty to hear you, but it dont lead to nothing.

Bright Tooth entered the conversation with the question:

You got English sovereign?

Hi had three English sovereigns; he offered one of them, which at that
time, in that country, would have bought two horses, with their harness,
outright. After some more haggling, backed by Bright Tooth, the old
woman agreed to lend a horse, saddled and bridled, for two days, for one
English sovereign and all the small change Hi had. It was, however,
agreed that this small change, amounting to seventeen Santa Barbara
pesetas, should be returned to the man who brought back the horse. Hi
thought that they drove a very hard bargain with him; but to have a
horse and to be away upon his journey were the desires of his heart at
the moment. Even so, he knew enough not to pay for a horse till he had a
little knowledge of it. He asked to see the horse.

Bright Tooth led him out to the yard at the back of the house, with the
remark that he was a very nice horse, a horse for a king or queen, being
tireless and good spirited, as well as so beautifully boned. Hi had
heard horses sold in England, by his father. He waited till they were in
the stable, where two horses were in stalls. The one nearer to the door
was a nice dark chestnut mare, which seemed somehow, even at a first
glance, a little too good for such a stall.

Is this the horse? Hi asked.

No, Bright Tooth said, the other.

The other was a sour-coloured pony engaged at that minute in gnawing off
the top of the partition between the stalls. He was doing this with an
ugly chucklehead screwed sideways, so that his yellow hooked teeth might
get a purchase on the splinter. He was rough-haired, having been out in
the rains (apparently in a hog wallow). The hair, stuck to patches of
mud, was scaling off him. He had not been shod nor had his feet been
pared. They stuck forward in long, splitting growths of horn almost like
slippers. A sort of gaiter of hard red mud coated his legs to his hocks.
He was straight-shouldered, and what old Bill always called a bit
goosey in the rump. His head, when he ceased from gnawing the barrier,
was loutish and ill set on. Stunsail ears and a Roman nose, Hi
thought. Worth six bob a corner.
