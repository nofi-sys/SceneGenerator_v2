What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
The name was mentioned. There was a momentary pause, and a low murmur
ran through the crowd; then shout after shout of applauding huzzas.

We know you!

Just like him!

Noble fellow!

The good doctor! Huzza! huzza!

And so the cry went up on all sides, for the doctors reputation for
benevolence was as wide as that of John Jacob Astor for the opposite
trait.

There seemed to be a vehement consultation among what appeared the
leaders of the mob, which lasted but for a moment or two, when one who
stood upon the top step looked up, and in a firm, respectful voice,
said to the doctor

Its all right, sir, about you! We shall let the women pass out! But
you must clear the house of them!

But it is dangerous to move my patient.

We cannot help that, doctor; we do this for your sake, not theirs, for
they ought every one of them to be burned, and we are determined to
abate the nuisance of this house. So hurry them along here quick, for
the boys will not keep quiet long.

Yes, hurry them women along; well let them go this time.

All but that lecturing _lady_ (?), who says that she would as soon
marry a negro as a white man!

Yes, all but her; we want to be rid of such creatures; lets duck her
in the Hudson.

No, boys, we will make no distinction. We have promisedlet the woman
go.

Down with the lecturing women and their black lovers!

Duck the hag! well wash off the scent for her!

Cries such as these convinced the doctor that indeed no time was to be
lost, particularly as the sound of the axe was now heard below in good
earnest. Approaching the bed hastily, he took the shivering form of
the panic-stricken woman, who had heard distinctly these last ominous
cries, into his arms. She clutched him with a desperate grip, while he
hurried down the stairs.

On the way, he met the Spiritual Professor in the passage, surrounded
by the women of the house, who were clustered about him, in the
seemingly vain hope of obtaining from him something of that ethereal
consolation and strength, of which he was the so much vaunted
Professor. Indeed, he himself now seemed the most woful, of all the
whimpering, terrified group, in want of any kind of strength, whether
spiritual or otherwise; and his teeth literally chattered, as he
clutched at the doctors passing arm.

Whwhwhat shall we do? They mean to burn the house, dont they?

Do? said the doctor, sternly, shaking off his grasp. Try and be a
man, if youve got it in you! Get these women out of the house, and
take yourself off on your spiritual legs as fast as you can, or you may
make some ugly acquaintances.

The Professor still clung to his skirts.

Oh Lord! the doctrine of correspondences does not sanction

Go to the devil, with your correspondence, or I shall kick you out of
my path! roared the angry doctor, while the snivelling Professor, more
alarmed than ever, slunk aside to let him pass. The crash and clatter
from below now announced that the mob had effected an entrance from the
street, and leaving the women, all screaming at the top of their lungs,
around their doughty spiritual guide, he rushed on with his burden
towards the front entrance, which had thus been taken by storm, and was
now rapidly filling with excited men. Some were seizing the furniture,
which they began to demolish, while others hurried forward to intercept
him.

It is the sick woman. Remember your promise; let me pass.

Yes, thats the good doctor; let him pass, boys.

No, not yet! roared a burly-looking ruffian, pressing through the
throng. We must see who it is he has got there. Who is she? and he
roughly dragged aside the shawl that partially covered her face.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to create suspense and tension as the protagonist tries to escape the mob. The author achieves this by having the mob constantly changing their minds about what they want to do, and by having the protagonist's escape route constantly blocked.
