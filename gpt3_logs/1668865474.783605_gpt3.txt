SCENE:
X.


Henry Hindes reached Hampstead quite early in the afternoon, and his
wife met him with a foreign letter in her hand.

Hannah was much changed by this time as well as himself. Always quiet
and refined, her manner had settled down into a general melancholy.
She tried to smile sometimes, and to look cheerful for the sake of her
little Wally, whom it was sad to think should be brought up between
such a father and mother, but the attempt was usually abortive. How
could she smile, whilst memory remained to her? But she never mentioned
the terrible secret between them to her husband. Only he could see, but
too plainly by the expression of her eyes, that she never forgot it,
and it made him nervous and uneasy in her presence. They had been as
happy as most husbands and wives before, and much happier than some;
but though Hannah clung to him through a sense of duty, she shuddered
if he touched her, or attempted to caress her, and Henry Hindes saw
it. The little girls, too, being banished from home, made a great
difference in The Old Hall. Elsie and Laurie never came back, even
for the holidays, though their mother saw them frequently, and their
father dared not ask to see them. Wally, too, was confined to the
nursery whenever he was indoors, and if he wanted to see him, it was
almost by stealth he was obliged to accomplish it. So the house, which
once had rung with childish laughter, was very much changed, as well
as everybody in it; and the servants, though not admitted to their
employers confidence, saw and heard enough to make them participators
in the fact, that something very unpleasant had come between the
master and the mistress. But, on that particular day, as Hannah met him
with the foreign letter in her hand, she tried to assume one of her old
smiles, and to welcome her husband cheerfully.

Here is a letter from Arthur, Henry, she said; it came by the twelve
oclock post, just after you had driven away this morning.

She held out a large, thin envelope to him as she spoke, and with a
species of grunt, which was the usual salutation Henry Hindes accorded
her, he took the letter and tore it open. The contents did not appear
to please him.

Heres a pretty kettle of fish, he exclaimed; the doctors out there
say that Edith must not pass another hot season in Bombay, so Arthur
has applied for furlough, and they are all coming home as soon as they
can pack up their traps.

This announcement took Hannah completely by surprise. Captain Arthur
Hindes was her husbands younger and only brother, indeed, his only
near relation, who had married a very nice girl from their house some
seven years before, and taken her out to Bombay, where they had a
family of five children. They had visited England once during that
period, when they had resided for a year at The Old Hall, and now
they were coming home again, and expected evidently to do the same
thing--_now_, when they least expected them--least needed them.

Coming back so soon, she faltered. Why! in one of her last letters,
Edith said they were bound to remain in Bombay for at least three years
more. Why doesnt Arthur send her to the hills instead? Does he mention
it as a settled thing?

If you dont believe me, read for yourself and see! replied her
husband, as he tossed the letter across the table. Hannah picked it up,
and read,--

DEAR HARRY,--Youll be surprised, but I hope not sorry, to hear that
we are all on the hop for home again. Edith has had a nasty attack
lately--uncommonly like cholera--and it has left her so weak, that
the doctor says I must not keep her in Bombay another hot season. We
thought of the Hills at first, but he so strongly recommends England,
that I have applied for my long leave, and, as all our fellows are
here, have no doubt that I shall get it. I think, after all, it is
just as well we should make a move. Fanny and Hal have grown so tall
and thin that they look more as if they had been run up through
gas-pipes than ever; and the last addition has suffered terribly
with its teething, so we shall be none the worse for seeing dear old
England again. We shall be there three years, so as to settle the
elder chicks at school before we return to India. How I am longing
to see The Old Hall again, and your lovely garden. It will be in
its spring dress by the time we arrive. I hope the son and heir
is flourishing, and not grown too proud to acknowledge his poor
relations under his accession to the fortune that has come to him.
There are only six months between him and my little Charlie. They will
be nice playmates. What a jolly old fellow Mr Crampton must have been.
How you must regret his loss! Our best love to Hannah and the girls.
You may expect to see us home about the middle of April, or beginning
of May. Good-bye, old chappie.--Ever your affectionate brother,

ARTHUR HINDES.

Hannah read the letter through in silence, and laid it down.
