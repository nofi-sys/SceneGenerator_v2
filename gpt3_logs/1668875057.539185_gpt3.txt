SCENE:
She went on reading, or pretending to read, for some minutes, until her
husbands voice once more interrupted her.

A fine lot of affection you seem to have for me now you have come
back! I dare say you wish I was dead all the time. Never even asking me
how I feel! What did you come at all for?

Annie put down her book again, and came toward the bed.

I didnt think it was good for you to talk just at first. I thought,
if I sat quite quietly, you would go to sleep again.

No, you didnt; you wanted to read your book. What is it?

It is a French book called Consuelo.

French! Oh, of course--something too learned for me!

It is not learned at all. Ill translate it to you if you like; but I
dont think you would care much about it.

Oh, no; it would be over my head, of course!

His voice was growing very feeble and husky. Annie poured some medicine
into a glass and brought it to him.

Now, said she, coaxingly, as she slipped her hand under his pillow to
raise his head, you had better drink this, and then lie still for a
little while. You are not very strong yet, you know.

I shant drink it--I wont have that vile stuff poured down my
throat! said he, in a weak, dogged whisper.

You had better take it. Cant you feel how weak your voice is
getting? said Annie, persuasively.

I wont take that, I tell you! That wont do--do me--any good! Fetch
me some brandy-and-soda.

No, I cant do that; it wouldnt be good for you.

Do you hear what I say? Fetch me some brandy-and-soda!

He made a feeble, spasmodic effort to knock the glass out of her hand;
but she held it out of his reach, and, laying his obstinate head, which
she was still supporting, gently down on the pillow again, she put the
medicine down on the table.

Dont you mean to obey me? I wont drink your filthy poisons! If you
want to get rid of me you had better doctor some brandy for me, and
then perhaps Ill take it.

The brandy by itself would be poison to you now, without my
doctoring, said Annie, quietly. As soon as you are well again you
can drink what you like, you know; and the more faithfully you follow
the doctors orders now, the sooner you will be able to drink as much
brandy as you please.

She said it in a very soft, gentle voice; but she could not quite
keep the scorn she felt for him out of the last words. Weak tears of
impotent anger gathered in Harrys eyes.

You treat me like a dog! A fine make-believe your wifely duty is. When
Im well again Ill turn you out of the house at an hours notice--that
I will!

She saw that he was exciting himself dangerously; and fearing the
effects of this emotion upon him in his weak state, she took the hand
he was convulsively clinching on the bedclothes in one of hers, and
putting her lips to it, said, in the most winning tone the actress
could assume:

My poor dear Harry, I would give you what you want if I dared; and
when the doctor comes, I will ask if you may have it. And I will go
away when you like; but you will let me stay until you are well, wont
you?

Harry was touched by this unexpected appeal.

All right; you may stay, he murmured magnanimously.

And wont you let me give you your medicine? Ill drink some of it
first, if you like, to show you it isnt poison.

No, that is only nonsense. Ill take it, whispered the grumpy
invalid, conquered; and when he had drank it, and she laid his head
gently down again, he said, Thank you. You may kiss me if you like,
old girl.

Annie availed herself of this permission--not enthusiastically, but
still not without a touch of tenderness; and she sat in the chair by
the bedside until he went quietly off to sleep again.
