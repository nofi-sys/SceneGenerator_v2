SCENE:
XXVII.


Annie heard her husband open the door, but she did not turn round;
then she heard his footsteps advance to the middle of the room and
stop. She still stood leaning against the open French window, seeing
nothing before her, and waiting for him to speak to learn what tone
he was going to assume toward her. At last she heard him clear his
throat, as if to attract her attention; but she took no notice. She
fancied he must be working himself up to a proper pitch of indignation,
and she tried to school herself to show a bold front when at last
his wrath should burst out. Her case was the stronger by far, and,
although that fact did not give her all the consolation it should have
done at that moment, yet it would stand her in good stead when the
conflict had really begun. Nevertheless, she would have given worlds
for the _sang-froid_ with which she had entered upon any contest with
him in the old days when his opinion upon any subject was a matter of
indifference to her, and when his outbursts of unreasonable anger had
excited in her nothing but contempt and disgust.

He cleared his throat again, and again she took no notice. At last he
spoke:

Annie, arent you going to speak to me? he asked, in the gentlest,
most entreating of voices.

She turned round in surprise. He stood there before her, this big,
handsome young fellow who could tame the most fiery of horses with a
hand and a will of iron, shy, nervous, irresolute, looking down with
wistful submission on the small, slight woman at the window.

Havent you a word for me after all these weeks? said he, as she
was silent. I cant help being horsy, so wasnt it better to turn my
horsiness to some account? I forgave you for not answering my letters;
but, now youve come to see me of your own accord, I think you might
have a kiss for me.

Annie looked, listened, in utter bewilderment. Letters! Kisses! What
was he talking about? Was this Harry, with the loving, pleading eyes
and the gently reproachful tone, the ungrateful, faithless husband
she had come to upbraid? Was this some artful plan to avert her
accusations by being first with trifling charges against herself? Still
in perplexity, but thawing in spite of herself under his affectionate
words, she moved mechanically toward him. But the want of spontaneity
in the action roused his passionate temper, and he stepped back from
her, his face all flushed with wounded pride and affection.

Dont make a martyr of yourself, pray, said he. I dont want a
little, cold duty-peck because Im your husband. If you cant kiss me
because you love me dont kiss me at all.

She was in his arms, clinging to him, her upturned face aglow with
passionate love, almost before he had spoken the last words of his
hasty outburst. Muriel West, money, jewelry, unanswered letters--all
were forgotten, thrust aside as matters to be explained hereafter or
shelved as things of no account. Whomsoever he might have loved in
the past he loved her now; whatever he might have done he was holding
her in his arms now; and he might condescend to prove his innocence
of every charge she might bring against him, or he might treat them
with contemptuous silence--he was her husband, she loved him, he loved
her--what else could matter at that moment?

It was not until they were sitting side by side on the sofa in the
twilight that some words of his roused in her the remembrance of the
grievances with which she had come armed.

Why didnt you come before, my darling? I have been longing for a
sight of you; and the only glimpses I got of you were on the stage.

But why was that? Why didnt you come and see me, or send for me?

How could I, when you were so disgusted with me?

Annies face fell. A cloud had come over this new happiness already. He
had himself reminded her of his own delinquencies, which she had been
ready enough, in the first flush of this joy in her husbands society,
to believe untrue.

I think, said she, drawing her hand out of his instinctively, that I
had reason to be.

But I dont think you had any, said he earnestly. I know you will be
able to prove you were right, because you are so much cleverer than me
that what you say always sounds right, even when I cant help thinking
youre really wrong after all.

Well, prove that I had no reason to be annoyed, and disgusted--if you
can.

Dont speak so coldly to me then, and I will tell you what I think;
but I cant if you turn away your head so stiffly and speak just as if
I were the old Harry that you used to hate.
