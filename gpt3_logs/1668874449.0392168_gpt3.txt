Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Mrs. Stovall was on the porch speeding a parting guest, a dark-eyed,
trim young woman of unobtrusive manners.

Mrs. McCoy, I want you should meet an old friend of mineMrs. Tait,
said the housekeeper by way of introduction.

It was like a blow in the face to Ruth. She drew herself up straight and
stiff. A flush of indignation swept into her face. With the slightest of
bows she acknowledged the presentation, then marched into the house and
to her bedroom.

All the sweet gladness of the day was blotted out for her. Just as she
and Rowan were coming together again the woman who had separated them
must intrude herself as a hateful reminder of the past. She had forgiven
her husbandyes; but her forgiveness did not extend to the woman who
had led him into temptation. And even if she had pardoned him, she had
not forgotten. It would be impossible ever quite to forget the sting of
that memory with its sense of outrage at a wrong so flagrant.

She did not deny that she was jealous. All of Rowan she could hold fast
would not be too much to carry her through their years of separation.
Except for this one deadening memory, she had nothing to recall but good
of him. Why must this come up now to torment her?

A knock sounded on the door. Suppers ready, announced Mrs. Stovall
tartly.

I dont want any to-night.

After a moments silence Ruth heard retreating footsteps. A few minutes
later there came a second knock.

Ive brought you supper.

The housekeeper did not wait for an invitation, but opened the door and
walked in. Never before had she done this.

Ruth jumped to her feet from the chair where she was sitting in the
dusk. I told you I didnt want any supper, she said, annoyed.

Mrs. Stovall had promised Rowan to look after Ruth while he was away. In
her tight-lipped, sardonic fashion she had come to be very fond of this
girl who was the victim of the frontier tragedy that had so stirred
Shoshone County. Silently she had watched the flirtation with Larry
Silcott and the division between husband and wife. It was her firm
opinion that Ruth needed a lesson to save her from her own foolishness.
But what had occurred on the porch a half hour since had given her a new
slant on the situation. Martha Stovall prided herself on her plain
speaking. She had a reputation for it far and wide. She proposed to do
some of it now.

Why dont you want any supper?

The housekeeper set the tray down on a little table and faced her
mistress. Every angular inch of her declared that she intended to settle
this matter on the spot.

Ruth was too astonished for words. Mrs. Stovall did not miss the
opportunity.

What ails you at the supper? Are you sick? The thin lips of the woman
were pressed together in a straight line of determination.

Im not hungry.

Fiddlededee! Its Norma Tait thats spoiled your appetite. What call
have you to be so highty-tighty? Isnt she good enough for you?

I would rather not discuss Mrs. Tait, answered Ruth stiffly. I dont
quite see why you should come into my room and talk to me like this,
Mrs. Stovall.

Dont you? Well, maybe Im not very polite, but what Ive got to say is
for your goodand Im going to say it, even if you order me off the
place when I get through.

The answer of Ruth was rather disconcerting. She said nothing.

When I introduced you to Norma Tait you most insulted her. Id like to
know why, demanded the housekeeper.

I think I wont talk about that, replied the young woman with icy
gentleness.

Then Ill do the talking. Youve heard that fool story about Norma and
Mac. Ill bet a cooky thats what is the matter with you. The shrewd
little eyes of Martha Stovall gimleted the girl. Its all a pack of
lies. I ought to know, for it was me that asked Mac to drive Norma down
to Wagon Wheel in his car.
