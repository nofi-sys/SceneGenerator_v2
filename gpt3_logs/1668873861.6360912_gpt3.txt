Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Good God! cried Nathan, a light breaking in upon him. You dont mean
that Mrs. Lucien is

My lost wife, Agnes! Yes.

Oh! my poor friend, forgive me. I never dreamed of such a thing.
Believe me, Major, I am innocent of any such plot as this. Mrs. Lucien
is an entire stranger to me. I only knew of her through Mrs. Wylies
friendship for her, and she knows nothing of her past history. We have
been blind instruments in the hands of Providence, Major. Why should it
have happened?

God knows, or the Devil. Id rather have seen Agnes in her coffin,
Bartram. That villain Teasdale must be with her.

Impossible! Did he not tell you otherwise? Dont, Major, lay that crime
upon her in your excitement. Surely, surely she is blameless and good.
Her face shows that.

Aye! Her face is the face of an angel. O Agnes, Agnes! Nathan, Im
beset by a thousand furies and fiends of torture. What shall I do? I
want to see her and talk with her. I must, now, nowthat Ive seen her
at all.

Nathan was perplexed.

You might call at her hotel and see her in the morning, he ventured to
suggest.

No, Ill see her to-night. Ill be here at the door when this infernal
business is over, and I will see and speak to her. I want to lift the
weight from my conscience, if possible, and I _will_ speak to her.

But, think of the shock to her. My friend, is it best?

Best? Perdition take me! I dont know what is best. Leave me! Go back
into the hall and tell your friends I am sickvertigojimjamsanything.
But leave me to think.

But, began Nathan, loth to leave him by himself in his excited
condition.

Go in! I cant be spoken to now. Go back into the hall. Will you? he
exclaimed vehemently.

Nathan turned away slowly and reentered the building, beset with many
misgivings. What might not this irascible and tortured man do if left
alone?

Mrs. Lucien had begun her reading. She held in her hand a knife which
had been submitted to her for test.

I am sure the person to whom this knife belongs is one of very orderly
habits, or was. The present owner has not had it very long. I can see
the woman to whom it formerly belonged. She has auburn hair, and is
rather below the medium height. She is laughing, and says she won the
knife on a philopena.

Is this true? asked the chairman, taking the knife from Mrs. Lucien
and holding it up.

It is true, responded a man from the audience. I am acquainted with
the knifes history.

Suddenly an idea presented itself to Nathan, upon which he immediately
acted.

He picked up one of the Majors gloves which, in his agitation, he had
withdrawn and left behind him, and motioning to an usher, asked him to
place it upon the table for Madame Luciens reading. Then he awaited
results with eager curiosity.

One after another the articles were taken up and read.

This brings me face to face with an aged woman, she said, as a thimble
was presented. She calls Annette, Annette.

A woman across the aisle from Nathan began to sob. He noticed the tawdry
showiness of her attire, and read in her face a pathetic history as she
stood up to reclaim the thimble. It was my mothers, she sobbed, as
she dropped back into her seat.

Then Madame Luciens fingers lifted the glove Nathan had sent to her.

I am sure the owner of this glove is a person of very positive
character, she began. He will combat any irrational belief, or one not
proven to his satisfaction. I can feel a chill of opposition. IIcan
Mrs. Lucien began to breathe in gasps. Her hands shook. Nathan was
frightened at the spasm of agony which swept her face. She dropped the
glove and stretched out her hands helplessly.
