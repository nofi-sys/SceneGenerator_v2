SCENE:
Im sorry, said Larry. Then catching the look which Larkin threw him,
he added: He never done nothin to me, sure; but when I was a kid an
me father was a-livin, he told me never to knock.

The plaster ceiling was seamed with cracks, discolored by the soaking
through of rain. Larkin, lying on his back, thoughtfully followed the
longest of these with his eye; and when he had reached its termination,
he said:

If youse was in with yer grandad just now, Larry, yed come in for
some o the gilt.

Murphy turned about with a jerk that threatened to end the cots unity.

I dont want his coin; I wouldnt make a play for it if I was flat on
me uppers! I said that I was sorry for the old man, not that I would
scoop his money after he was planted!

Keep yer shirt on, said Larkin; I was ony sayin, ye know.

Mrs. McGonagles son, Goose, was seated upon an empty cracker box in
front of Clancys grocery; his wagon was drawn up at the curb, and a
small Italian was shining his russet leather shoes. His mother came up,
panting and wheezing from her haste.

Run intill the house! she exclaimed breathlessly.

All right; Im gittin me leathers shined, said her son.

Faith yez shine kin wait, an somethin ilce cant. Mrs. McGonagle
dropped upon a salt-fish barrel, regardless, in her excitement, of what
effect the brine would have upon her church-going skirt. Run she
continued, an tell Larry Murphy that his poor owld granfathers at
deaths door an wants till spake till him.

Goose stared at her incredulously.

Gway, said he.

Dont sit there starin at me, all as wan as a County Down peat
cutter, but go at wanst! Divil another step cud I stir iv the gates av
Heaven wur stanin open till me!

Within a minute after hearing the above tidings McGonagle came charging
up the crooked steps leading to their lodgers room, like a drove of
mavericks.

Git into yer rags, Murphy, cried he, yer wanted.

Is it about Kelly an Hogan? asked Larry. I aint no witness. I
didnt see the scrap.

No, its yer granfather; hes a cashin in, an wants to see youse.
Me mother jist told me.

Larry was out on the floor like a shot, pulling on his clothes and
talking incoherently.

I kin hear the song theyll sing, said he. Theyll pull me into
rags; aint that right, Larkin? Wheres me collar buttons?

Look in yer other shirt, Jimmie was also up, and dressing rapidly.
Murphy found the missing articles and resumed:

Theyll say I wus ony waitin fer a chance to get next to the gilt.
The thought seemed to anger him and he glared at his friends. But it
aint so, he cried, so help me God, it aint! I dont want the coin;
Ive got a job, aint I? And Ive went up against it this far, alone,
an I kin go the rest o the distance, too. He turned to the others,
an appeal in his voice. Did I ever make a play? Speak out, did I?

Sure not, said McGonagle.

Yer raw there, Murphy, said Larkin. If youse hadnt been afeared o
what peopled say the old mand shook yer hand long ago.

Larry drew in the slack of his suspenders and closed the catch with
a snap. He looked at Larkin in surprise; this was a thought that had
never struck him.

Dye tink so? was all he said.

I certny do. I often seen youse brush elbows with him on the street,
and him turn and look after ye. Hed a-spoke to ye if youse had give
him ony half a chance, see?

Didnt he have a chance when I was a kid? Didnt he have a chance
when me father died and the neighbours in the alley had to take up a
collection to bury him? Did he do anyting for me then? Not on yer
life, he didnt! He let em put me in a Home.
