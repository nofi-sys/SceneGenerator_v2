Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
VI

FIRST PRACTICE


There was a large attendance at half-past three that afternoon in the
baseball cage. Some forty-odd candidates, most of them last years
first and second team members, had assembled for work, while fully as
many others were on hand to watch proceedings. Not that anything very
exciting promised, but it was a raw, uncomfortable sort of day outside
and fellows were glad of any event that offered a half hours mild
amusement. The cage was not a very ambitious affair, for it had been
an after-thought and had been built after the building was erected and
at a sacrifice of one of the two bowling alleys, which, thrown into
the space formerly occupied by a storeroom, supplied area for a modest
cage. It was large enough to throw at base distance in and to hold
batting practice in if the batter didnt attempt anything more than a
tap. Also, of course, it made an excellent place for the pitchers to
limber up.

Dud and Jimmy went over to the gymnasium together, for the latter had
finally decided to try his luck with the first nine. When, having got
into his gymnasium suit, Dud looked around for Jimmy, he was rather
disconcerted to find himself confronting Starling Meyer across the
bench. Dud didnt feel so brave today, and would have been just as
satisfied if he hadnt run across the hockey star. But the latter
only glared in a haughtily disgusted manner and turned his back, and
Dud heaved a sigh of relief, not loud but fervent, and made his way
unobtrusively out of the locker-room. He was careful to nod or speak to
such fellows as he knew, although lots of times it took a good deal of
courage. He was obeying Jimmys directions, however.

Dont wait for fellows to speak to you, Jimmy had ordered. Speak
first. Dont act as if you were afraid they wouldnt know you, either.
Just say, Hello, Smith, sort of careless-like, or, if you dont know
them fairly well, just nod and smile. Dont grin, smile. Like this.
And Jimmy turned the corners of his mouth up slightly and nodded his
head very briefly. Get the idea! I know who you are, but I dont
recall the name. But dont try that on the big fellows likewell,
like Murtha and Trafford and those chaps. You want to be polite to
them, sort of cordial, too. Only dont let them think youre trying to
swipe.

Which I am, Dud had interpolated a trifle bitterly.

Not at all! Youre merely beingertactful. Theres a difference.
Tact and diplomacy are great things, Dud. You want to practice em.

Toadying, I call it!

Tut, tut! Nothing like it. Call itcall it a studied effort to
please!

Call it what you like, Dud had replied somberly. Its poor business.

Some of our greatest citizens have been diplomats, Dud. Look at me!

Duds gaze picked out a number of baseball celebrities whom, under
Jimmys tutelage, he had come to know well enough to speak to. In every
case, if he found himself near enough to speak he spoke, or, failing
that, he nodded, trying to look quite at his ease and not succeeding
very well. Guy Murtha was there, of course, for Guy was this years
captain. He was eighteen, a tall, decidedly plain youth with so many
likable qualities that one soon forgot about his features. And Bert
Winslow and Nick Blake were talking together further on, and near by
were Ben Myatt and Pete Gordon and Nate Leddy. And Hugh Ordway was one
of a group the rest of whom Dud knew only by sight. Jimmy appeared from
somewhere and about that moment Mr. Sargent, the physical director and
baseball coach, came in with Tris Barnes, the manager. Mr. Sargent,
or Pete, as he was called, was short and square, with a beard and
mustache and a pair of restless brown eyes behind the big round lenses
of his spectacles. He had a nervous, impatient manner of speaking and
was quite likely, to the secret amusement and delight of the fellows,
to get his words twisted when the least bit excited.

All out of the cage, please, but team candidates, was his order.
Close that door, somebody. Better bolt it, Churchill. Now, fellows,
if youll kindly top stalkingahstop talking, well get started.
Captain Murtha, want to say anything?

I guess not, sir. Therell be plenty of time to talk later on,
wont there? Id like to say, though, that were going to need more
candidates than are here today and I wish you fellows would try and
get others to come out. Theres no use waiting until we get outdoors,
for this work in the cage is very important and fellows who miss it
wont stand much show. Our season begins pretty early this spring, a
week earlier than last year, and we havent any too much time to get
in shape. Id like mighty well to see fully twenty more fellows here
tomorrow.
