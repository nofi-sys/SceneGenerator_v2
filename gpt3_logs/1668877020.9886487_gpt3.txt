SCENE:
XIII

CONFESSION


A quarter of an hour later they were sitting around the bed of glowing
coals busily concerned with the chops and bread and butter. The chops
were decidedly underdone in the middle although beautifully crisp
outside, and Nick came in for some criticism as a cook. But each of
the four ate his shareit had proved rather a problem to divide three
chops into four equal portions!and so, if the proof of the pudding
is in the eating, Nick was vindicated. They had also brought four
potatoes to roast, but it was decided that life was too short and
appetites too impatient to wait for them, and so Jimmy buried them in
the ground, after carefully cutting them into quarters, and agreed to
share the proceeds of the crop in September with the others, estimating
the yield at two pecks. When they were thirsty they went down the bank,
climbed into a canoe and leaned their heads into the river, thus, as
Nick pointed out, getting not only a drink but a bath.

The doughnuts, now diminished to eleven, were served out as dessert,
Jimmy, of course, receiving only two as his share, and were consumed
with the peaches and cheese. Jimmys knife was rather the worse for
its encounter with the can, but Dud kept his promise of opening the
latter. They speared the peaches out with slivers, passing the can
around the circle until nothing was left but the juice. Then they drank
that. Afterwards they tossed the can into the river and threw pebbles
at it until it floated slowly out of range. By that time it was fully
twilight and the April evening was growing chill. So they built up the
fire again and sat closer, huddling together for better protection from
the little breeze that whispered through the dead grass and leafless
boughs. For a while no one showed much inclination for conversation,
but after a while Hugh let fall a murmured remark and presently they
were talking desultorily of this and that, or, at least, Jimmy and
Hugh and Nick were. Dud, as usual, had little to say, and finally Nick
remarked:

Shut up, Baker, and let someone else get a word in. I never heard such
a chatterbox.

Jimmy chuckled. Isnt he gabby? he asked.

Is he like this in the room, Jimmy? Nick inquired.

N-no, and thats the funny part of it. When he and I are alone
together hes just full of words; cant get them out fast enough. In
company, though, hes horribly otherwise. Ive been trying to break
him of it, butJimmy sighed lugubriouslynothing doing.

I dare say he believes in waiting until he has something to say,
offered Hugh. Is that the idea, Baker?

Oh, I dont know. Dud laughed uncertainly. I never seem to think of
things whenwhen Im around with a crowd.

Well, you dont call us a crowd, do you? demanded Nick. Come on
now; loosen up; spring some of those scintillant remarks that Jimmy is
always repeating. Know what he does, Baker? Well, he tells em around
and sort of gets the credit for em himself. Of course, he says you
said them, but theres a sort ofof inflection in his voice that gives
you the idea that he put you up to it oror something; if you know
what I mean, as Hugh would say.

Oh, Duds full of bright things, said Jimmy carelessly. Only the
trouble is he doesnt talk for publication.

And youre his press agent, eh? laughed Nick. Ive often wondered
He stopped. Then he laughed softly and Jimmy was aware that he was
regarding him mirthfully in the half darkness.

Whats the bally joke? murmured Hugh.

Oh, nothing. That is Nick fell into silence again. Then: Most
of the things Jimmy tells sound a whole lot like Jimmy, he stated
suggestively. There was a moments silence, broken at last by Dud.

They are Jimmys, he said quietly.

Here, dont try to put the blame on me! Jimmy laughed loudly. Thats
a punk trick, Dud!

Honest confession is good for the soul, said Nick lightly. Come
across, Jimmy. Whats the idea? Everyone knows youve been touting
Baker like anything ever since Christmas recess. What is it, a
conspiracy?

Jimmy laid a twig carefully on the fire. I dont know what youre
talking about, he grumbled.

Oh, yes, you do, old man! Were all friends together, you know, and
nothing you say will be used against you. That all right, Baker?
