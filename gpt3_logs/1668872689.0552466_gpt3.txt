SCENE:
There, they are at it! shouted the man with the gaping mouth. I told
you so! I told you that Professor was always kissing her!

Yes!

There they are, sure enough!

I always thought so!

The honor of my house! bristled the landlady, striding forward. I
did not expect this of you, Professor!

Madam! said the gentleman with his hair behind his ears, striding
forward as he released the suddenly collapsed and seemingly lifeless
form he had just held within his embrace, and which fell back now
heavily upon the pillow-spread, which was instantly discolored by a new
gush of blood from the mouth. I was administering, with all my zeal,
spiritual comfort to this poor, sick and dying sister, when you burst
in! See her condition now!

He waved his hand towards the tragic figure. The Professor occupied
a parlor on the first floor, beside two bed-rooms adjoining this, and
being on the palmy heights of his renown and plenitude of purse, it was
not convenient for the landlady to quarrel with him at present. Ah,
if that is the case, Professor, I beg you to pardon us. The husband
of this woman has misrepresented you and your beneficent motives, and
accuses you of all sorts of improprieties. We came up, at his urgency,
to see for ourselves, and the shocking condition in which we find her
now, proves that the ravings of the husband are, as she has always
represented them, insane.

Ive seen you kissing her before! roared the husband, advancing
threateningly upon the Professor, who, however spiritual in creed, did
not now appear particularly spirited, as he turned very pale, retreated
backwards, and holding up his two trembling hands imploringly,
exclaimedHold! hold! my dear brother! It was a spiritual kiss! I
meant you no harm, nor that angel who lies there dying! Our kiss was
pure and holy as the new snow. Hold him! hold him! Dont let him hurt
me! I am a non-resistant! I am for peace!

Your holy kisses! I dont believe in your holy kisses! gnashed the
enraged husband, still following him up with warlike demonstrations;
but here the easily appeased landlady interposed once more, to save the
honor of her house in preventing a fight.

No blows in my house! she shrieked, as she threw herself between
the parties. The Professor is a man of God, and shall not be abused
here; shame on you, Aminadab, with your poor, persecuted wife there,
dying before your face! Everybody will believe what she says about your
persecutions now!

Bah, you dont know that woman! shes no more dying than you are!
grunted the fellow, whose wrath fortunately seemed to be of that kind
that a straw might turn it aside. All the women rolled up their eyes
and lifted their two hands at this speech.

What a brute!

The horrid, murdering wretch! and she bleeding at the mouth, and from
the lungs, too!

Lord save the poor womans soul, with a husband like that!

And other speeches of like character were ejaculated by all the women
present.

At this moment a fresh effusion of blood, accompanied by a low groan,
from the mouth of the suffering patient, flooded the clean spread with
its purple current, and the horrified females rushed from the room,
screaming

Hes killed her at last, poor thing!

Wheres the doctor?

Shes dying of his brutalityrun for the doctor! At this moment,
with a hasty and heavy step, that gentleman was heard advancing along
the passage, followed by a crowd of pale, frightened-looking women. He
strode into the room.

What now?whats to pay? and his eye fell on the trembling form of
the brutal husband, who had by no means forgotten the rough handling he
had received, and now skulked and quailed like a whipped cur, as his
eye saw the instant thunder darken on the brow of the doughty doctor.

You here againyou brutal fellow? I shall instantly bind you over to
keep the peace toward this unfortunate woman, whose life you are daily
endangering by your brutalities. Take yourself off, sir! Aminadab
waited for no second invitation, but availed himself of the open
doorway.
