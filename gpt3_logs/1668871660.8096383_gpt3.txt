SCENE:
"And now," he continued, "we must go cautiously or we spoil all."

The horsemen made a wide detour, and got between the bush and the
mob; and the ground being favourable, here it was determined to camp
for the night.  The object of the stockmen was not to alarm the herd,
but to prevent them from getting any farther off till morning, when
the march homewards would commence.  With this intent, log fires were
built here and there around the herd; and once these were well alight
the mob was considered pretty safe.  All, however, had been done very
quietly; and during the live-long night, until grey dawn broke over
the hills, the fellows would have to keep those fires burning.

Supper was a more pleasing meal, for there was the addition of tea;
after which, with their feet to the log fire--Bob and Craig enjoying
a whiff of tobacco--they lay as much at their ease, and feeling every
whit as comfortable, as if at home by the "ingleside."  Gentleman
Craig had many stories and anecdotes to relate of the wild life he
had had, that both Archie and Bob listened to with delight.

"I'll take one more walk around," said Craig, "then stretch myself on
my downy bed.  Will you come with me, Mr. Broadbent?"

"With pleasure," said Archie.

"Mind how you step then.  Keep your whip in your hand, but on no
account crack it.  We have to use our intellect versus brute force.
If the brute force became alarmed and combined, then our intellect
would go to the wall, there would be another stampede, and another
long ride to-morrow."

Up and down in the starlight, or by the fitful gleams of the log
fires, they could see the men moving like uneasy ghosts.  Craig spoke
a word or two kindly and quietly as he passed, and having made his
inspection, and satisfied himself that all was comparatively safe, he
returned with Archie to the fire.

Bob was already fast asleep, rolled snugly in his blanket, with his
head in the hollow of his upturned saddle; and Archie and Craig made
speed to follow his example.

As for Craig, he was soon in the land of Nod.  He was a true Bushman,
and could go off sound as a bell the moment he stretched himself on
his "downy bed," as he called it.

But Archie felt the situation far too new to permit of slumber all at
once.  He had never lain out thus before; and the experience was so
delightful to him that he felt justified in lying awake a bit, and
looking at the stars.  The distant dingoes began to howl, and more
than once some great dark bird flew over the camp, high overhead, but
on silent wings.

His thoughts wandered away over the thousands and thousands of miles
that intervened between him and home, and he began to wonder what
they were all doing at Burley; for it would be broad daylight there,
and very likely his father was trudging over the moors, or through
the stubbles.  But dreams came and mingled with his waking thoughts
at last, and were just usurping them all when he became conscious of
the approach of stealthy footsteps.

He lay perfectly still, though his hand sought his ready revolver;
for stories of black fellows stealing on out-sleeping travellers
began to crowd through his mind, and being young to the Bush, he
could not prevent that heart of his from throbbing uneasily and
painfully against his ribs.

How did they brain people, he was wondering, with a boomerang or
nullah? or was it not more common to spear them?

But, greatly to his relief, the figure immediately afterwards
revealed itself in the person of one of the men, silently placing an
armful of wood on the half-dying embers.  Then he silently glided
away again, and next minute Archie was wrapt in the elysium of
forgetfulness.

The dews lay all about, glittering in the first beams of the sun,
when he awoke, feeling somewhat cold and considerably stiff; but warm
tea and a breakfast of wondrous solidity soon put him all to rights
again.

Two nights after this the new stock was safe in the yards; and every
evening before sundown, for many a day to come, they had to be
"tailed," and brought within the strong bars of the rendezvous.

Branding was the next business.  This is no trifling matter with old
cattle.  With the calves indeed it is a bit troublesome at times, but
the grown-up ones resent the adding of insult to injury.  It is no
uncommon thing for men to be severely injured during the operation.
Nevertheless the agility displayed by the stockmen and their
excessive coolness is marvellous to behold.
