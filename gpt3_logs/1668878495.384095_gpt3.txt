SCENE:
XXI

The Chase


The meal was soon concluded, and Roy and Teddy told of their
adventures on the river.

Inwardly Mr. Manley was much concerned over their mishaps, but he
only nodded and smiled. He wanted to let his boys know that he
expected nothing less from them.

At the same time his face flushed with a glow of pride when Roy
told, modestly enough, of his fight with the eagle. He looked at the
knife with which his son had slain the bird, and silently put the
weapon in his pocket. By this the boy knew he was really affected by
the story. The knife would remain a relic, a proof of his sons
bravery. With the exception of Roy, Pop was the only one who
realized this. The others thought he had absent-mindedly put it in
his own pocket instead of returning it to Roy.

For a while Roy hesitated to tell his father of the payroll robbery
and Teddy knew he was holding off purposely, so he said nothing. But
when they were walking toward the corral, Roy decided it would be
best for his father to know the whole story, even if it did add to
his worry, so he told him.

Mr. Manley took it silently, only shaking his head sorrowfully. The
loss of the money affected him not so much as realizing that The Pup
was a thief. He had never liked the man, but a horse-thief and
payroll bandit--that was different from plain orneriness.

Guess I made a mistake in Marino, he declared. Got in the house
an stole my four hundred, did he! Well, maybe it was partly my
fault for lettin it lay around like that, so open. But none of the
boys I ever had would steal a cent. Gus, now-- he stopped, and bit
his lip. Gus was a topic that bothered him. You dont think Gus--

No, Dad, Gus had nothing to do with it, Teddy said positively.
Im sure of that, Dad!

Thats good, Mr. Manley sighed. I didnt think Gus was that kind.
Pshaw, I knew he wasnt! Wonder if well see him again? Well-- and
he shrugged his shoulders. But this is no time for wonderin. We
got to be on our way. So The Pup stole--right from the house! Stole
my payroll! He shook his head again, slowly, and walked off
muttering.

Dad would rather have that money taken twice than to think Gus was
mixed up in it, Teddy said to Roy in a low voice. Hes sorry The
Pup did it, too. He may have disliked Marino, as I guess we all did,
but dad hates to think any one is a thief.

The horses, saddled and ready, were waiting for them. Those who had
come with Mr. Manley had, of course, their own broncos, and Jake
Trummer supplied Teddy, Roy, Pop Burns and Bug Eye with other
mounts. They took with them food, and each saddle packed a rifle and
a blanket. The chase, even if it was successful, might take several
days to conclude. They had one big advantage--the rustlers did not
know they were being trailed. Thus they would take their time, and
Mr. Manley counted largely on this.

Guess were all set, the boss of the X Bar X stated, as he looked
about him. The men were mounted, waiting for the word to start.

Whenever you say, Bardwell, Jake Trummer suggested.

Then lets go!

The riders filed out of the yard and headed once more for the river.
Mr. Trummer had left word with one of his men on the ranch that the
canoe and its contents were to be taken care of, so there was no
need to return to the place where they had left it. Instead, the
riders cut diagonally across the range and headed away from the
direction the boys had come.

Dad, what about that landslide? Roy remarked, spurring his mount
up closer to his father. Nick arrived all fagged out and told us a
stranger gave you a wild tale about an avalanche.

It _was_ a wild tale, Mr. Manley declared. Jake said no such
thing occurred. Didnt you, Jake? But it had me worried, all the
same. By golly, if its not one thing its another!

Ill tell a maverick, Roy muttered, and then rode forward
silently. He was thinking of The Pup and Gus. Where had The Pup fled
to? They had seen him at the edge of the stream on the horse he had
stolen. Did he follow the river? Or did he branch out? Was there a
chance of catching him, as well as the cattle rustlers?
