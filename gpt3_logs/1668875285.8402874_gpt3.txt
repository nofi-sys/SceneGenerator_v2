SCENE:
And he likes you?

If he did not, he would not take the trouble to come.

And if it had not been for my existence, I suppose----

You have no right to suppose anything, said Annie, impatiently;
there is nothing to suppose. You are the only person who has ever
found the slightest fault with my conduct. There is no cause whatever
for your trifling jealousy, any more than there was at the Grange,
where you teased me to death with your absurd suspicions.

But you treated my jealousy differently then. It was trifling and
tiresome, I dare say. But you just laughed it off lightly then, while
now you grow impatient and restless under it.

You see I have been left in peace lately, and am not consequently in
such a high state of discipline as when I was at the Grange. I should
have been better prepared if I had guessed that your jealousy would
bring you up to town.

It was not my jealousy which brought me, Annie, but something which
I believe you care about just as little--my love. I got a letter from
you yesterday--you seem to have forgotten all about it, or perhaps you
wrote it just as a blind--I dont know--and you said in it you often
thought of the Grange, and you supposed by this time I could ride again
as well as ever, and had nearly forgotten all about such a trifling
thing as a wife. I got the letter at breakfast, and I said to myself,
The little jade is trying to pique me! Then she does care about
whether I forget her or not! And I made up my mind directly Id come
and see you all unexpectedly, and see what you would say. And I didnt
make too sure you would be glad; but, by Jove, I didnt expect quite
such a cool welcome as I got! And Harrys voice gave way just as he
reached the last words, and he leaned his elbow on the mantel-piece and
dropped his head into his hand, with his back to her.

Annie was touched, and she rose, with tears in her eyes, and crept up
to him, and took his other hand. But he shook her off, and remained
quite unsoftened by her tearful eyes.

Dont come and hang about me now, Annie, and speak to me in your
cooing voice, when I know you wish me a hundred miles away, or I shall
think your caresses were never worth having, said he, passionately.
And I thought I could trust you; I thought you were so good, so pure!
Even when I was jealous, I never thought you would pass yourself off
as an unmarried girl, just that you might be made love to by other
men--and when you knew all the time how fond I was of you, Annie!

Harry, Harry, do listen to me! I am not fond of anybody else--I have
not been made love to. Why wont you believe me? Look at yourself in
the glass, and see if you are not more likely to please a womans fancy
than--than Mr. Cooke--or anybody.

He had turned to look wistfully and reproachfully down at her, and she
had seized the opportunity to fasten herself coaxingly on his arm, and
to raise her other hand to his face to try to turn it toward the glass
over the mantel-piece.

Harry was not vain, and his own face had no particular attraction for
him; he gave a glance at the reflection of the little white fingers
which were holding his chin, and then he took her hand gently from his
face and looked at her.

I dont set up for a beauty-man, and lots of the actors you meet are
handsomer than me, I dare say. But it is more than I can understand how
you could like an ugly, washed-out, long-nosed, lank-haired hunchback
like that fellow I met outside! It is rather hard to be shunted for a
man who isnt even straight!

Annie winced under the speech; but she said:

Then how can you be so absurd as to be jealous of a man who
stoops--you, who are as straight as an arrow?

Ah, my limbs are all right; it is my head you complain of! answered
poor Harry, pitifully. I believe my heart is all right, too, only that
doesnt seem to matter to you clever women. I suppose that stooping
fellow can talk by the yard.

Mr. Cooke can ride and drive, too, said Annie, quietly. Men who talk
well can do other things, too, very often.

He can stick on a Park hack, or drive a dog-cart a couple of miles
without coming to grief, I dare say, returned Harry, in a louder
voice. But do you think he could break in an animal that had thrown
every groom in the stable, or ride as straight as I can across country,
or train a racer?

I dont suppose he is as much at home in a stable as you are,
certainly, said Annie, coldly, or that any of the actors I know are
so well able to beat a groom at his own work. I must do you so much
justice.
