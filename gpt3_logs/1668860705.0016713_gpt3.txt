SCENE:
Yes, I heard Orleans means to fight. I fear it will be a useless
sacrifice of life.

Well, Win, we had better wait a little longer and postpone the
argument until we have more information on the subject. Whats your
idea about Raggetts proposal? Do you think he really desires to see
you back with the money?

Certainly I do.

Well, I dont. My opinion is that he wants to get rid of one of us.
One is enough for his purpose and I have told you what that purpose is;
so, Win, I dont expect to see you again while Im on this ship.

He cant prevent me from returning with the money.

Oh, yes, he can. You cant reach the Spencer without his permission,
and while he thinks he can use me he wont grant that permission.

Then you are going to act as his pilot?

Thats a hard way to put it, Win. It may be that he wants to correct
his charts and in that case I shall be obliged to go with his surveying
party. It wont help him very much, I can promise you. I have an idea
of whats going to happen, but I may be mistaken. I shall have to trust
to my wits in the matter; but theres one thing I can tell you right
here, and I want you to bear it in mind: Hoppy Mayo will never turn
traitor to his country, though for some time to come he must be trusted
to play the game in his own way.

All right, Hoppy, Ill tell them what you said. Theres nobody in
Eastham will believe you to be a traitor.

Win reached his hand and his comrade grasped it warmly.

Next morning Captain Knowles was put on board the schooner. As the
little craft made sail and started on her voyage, Hoppy waved farewell
to his friend, more than ever convinced that he should not see him
again on the Spencer.

Captain Raggett sent word to Hoppy that the latter could have the
freedom of the ship provided he promised not to attempt to escape.
He was also informed that orders had been given to supply him with
clothing or anything else he required. Hoppy readily gave the promise
and thanked the commander for his thoughtfulness.

As the day went on, Hoppy Mayo noticed that everybody on board the
frigate seemed to be very busy. There was no interference with his
leisure and from his seat by one of the guns he was an interested
observer of the movements of the nimble sailors as they jumped from
place to place in obedience to the orders of the officers. So far as
he could see, there was no occasion for all the bustle, but at that
time he was not aware that this incessant training was Raggetts way of
keeping his men in condition for service at a moments notice.

Hoppys usually buoyant spirits were depressed by the events of the
day before and by the departure of his comrade. During the dinner
hour he listlessly followed the movements of a small skiff that was
zigzagging its way from the shore, its solitary occupant clumsily
handling the oars. When the skiff came within hailing distance of the
frigate the oarsman paused as if irresolute about venturing nearer the
warship. Soon the sound of music came over the waters and Hoppy started
to his feet as he recognized the familiar notes of Phil the Fifer. The
officer of the deck, who had been intently watching the skiff, laughed
heartily, and if he had any anxiety as to the boatmans intentions it
was entirely dispelled. Hoppy heard him remark to a brother officer:

Thats the old pedler who amuses the crew with his droll sayings and
his fife. Hes a favorite with the captain, but Im not sure that we
can allow him on board now.

In answer to his hail the skiff came alongside. Phil pulled off his old
hat and cheerfully accosted the officer:

Bedad, Lieutenant Jameson, its a cure for sore eyes to see your honor
agin! An what is all this throuble about that I cant enthertain me
old customers any more with a tune on the old fife?

We should be very glad to see you on deck, Phil, but the captains
orders are strict about admitting strangers aboard.

Sthrangers! Well, lieutenant, but that bates the divil. When was old
Phil a sthranger among the fine min o this ship, Id like to know?

Sorry, Phil, but it cant be helped this time.

Hoppy was puzzled at all this and he came to the side to look on. Phil
caught sight of him and giving him a significant wink, said:

Bedad, lieutenant, it seems to me that thim ordhers is aisily broken!
That gintleman up there is a sthranger to me, anyway! I dont remimber
ever havin seen him before, an his uniform aint that of the king of
England!
