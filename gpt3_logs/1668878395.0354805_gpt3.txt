SCENE:
XIV

Failure


A moment, a breathless, hushed moment, Teddy and Roy stood beneath
trees which still dripped from the recent rain, the drops falling in
a patter whenever the light breeze stirred the branches. Through the
darkness came those low, tense tones. As the boys listened, words
separated themselves from the mumble of sound.

... just heard about it, some one was saying. The speaker had a
high, nervous voice which he apparently kept softened by an effort.
Stay out from that shore, Bunk! Wanta have those fools on our
necks?

Aw, yore too touchy, Denver, another whined, and the boys heard
the swirl of a paddle being held in the water, evidently to swing
the boat around. The craft was probably drifting with the current
now, for the listeners could not detect the dip of blades forcing it
onward. They aint near here, the speaker went on. Go ahead.
Lets have the dope.

Roy leaned closer to Teddy and spoke with his mouth close to his
brothers ear.

Well follow, Roy whispered, and Teddy nodded to show that he
understood. Carefully the two boys picked their way along the bank,
hoping to hear more before the canoe drifted out of range.

How many times do I have to repeat this? the one called Denver
snarled. Now listen, you guys. Manley, up on the X Bar X, let a
herd of his cattle wander off his ground on to the grazin field of
Jake Trummer, of Whirlpool River Ranch.

Teddy started, and nudged Roy. His brother did not respond. He was
listening intently.

Now I happen to know--never mind how--that old man Trummer went to
Manley an told him if the dogies werent off there soon hed drive
em into the river. That was two or three days ago. Manley started
out to round em up. But he went overland, so hell be some time
gettin there. Thats where we come in.

And so do we! Teddy whispered. Roy, get this!

Well keep goin now, Denver continued, an take a little rest in
the morning just before we hit the rapids. Then we take our time
with the cows. Mike said hed have ponies waitin for us. We drive
the cows off Trummers range, hide em somewhere, an when Manley
comes up, his Durhams are gone, an he says Trummer drove em into
the river, like he said he would! What could be simpler?

You sure got it down pat, Denver, said a third voice. Lucky for
us that storm came up. All we have to do is to sit back an drift
along--make good time, too.

You allus was a great feller fer work, Porky, Denver said
contemptuously. How you ever--

The voice died away. Bunk had evidently steered the canoe further
from the shore, and the murmur of the still turbulent waters drowned
out the words that followed.

Teddy turned excitedly to Roy.

Did you hear that? he whispered. Come on! Lets get the gang!
Rustlers, thats what they are! After our cattle! And theyll beat
us to it, unless we can nab em!

Roy had already turned and was running toward their camp.

See to the canoe! he called over his shoulder. Ill get the
others. Take out all the stuff except the rifles. Well get those
waddies yet!

Realizing that haste was imperative, Teddy stumbled toward the
canoe. Frantically he started to unload. Heedless of consequences,
he threw the articles right and left, concentrating on the job of
emptying the craft as soon as possible. Every moment the rustlers
were getting farther and farther away.

This is our chance to save the cattle, the boy panted, as he
tossed out the last can of foodstuff. The dirty rustlers! Trying to
frame Trummer, too. If I could only--

Seizing hold of the boat, he sought to pull it to the waters edge,
but the task was too much for him. Gasping, he finally desisted, and
at that moment Roy, Bug Eye and Pop Burns appeared.
