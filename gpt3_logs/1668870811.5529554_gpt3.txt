SCENE:
An incident had occurred later that should have ended this
misunderstanding; and it would have done so had not the sense of
distance between them been magnified, in Larrys mind, by the very
nature of the happening.

Shannon, the teamster by whom he was employed, had one day called Larry
into the little office down by the river.

Larry, said he, Im after havin great call from the mills above in
Kensington, as ye know. Sure the bell av me telyphones jingling all
the Gods blessed day, an I have the divils own job gittin me teams
up there in time. Yesterday I bought six pair av the foinest jacks yez
iver laid eyes on, an five trucks as good as new; I have rinted the
back room av Kavanaughs on the Frankford road as an up-town branch;
an its yezsilf I want till take charge av it. The work will be asey
an genteel an Ill pay yez twinty dollars a week.

After a moments sober thought Larry had replied:

The jobs a cinch, an the moneys good; but, say, Pat, how do youse
tink Ill size up to the work? I cant write atall an ony kin read
a little.

Now God forgimine for an ijit! exclaimed Shannon. Sure an I niver
wanst thought av that. That puts an end till it, Larry; the work is
beyant yez, by.

Larry understood this and felt it keenly. He endeavoured to convey an
impression of carelessness; but Shannon was not deceived.

Common sincell tell yez, Larry, said he, kindly, that the man that
takes howld av me up-town branch must have a bit av larnin. Give up
runnin wid the gang, lad, an go till the night school.

Larry paid very little attention to what the boss was saying; he was
wrestling with the bitterness within him. But that night, as he was
crossing the railroad on his way to the club, he noticed that a broad
shaft of light flowed from each window of the old Harrison School, and
then Shannons words came back to him. A group of boys were skylarking
in the entry where a single gas light flared redly in the gloom.

Night school? inquired he of one of these.

Sure, answered the boy. Started last week.

His mind was made up in an instant, and he started up the stairs toward
the principals room. But with his hand upon the door knob, he paused.
What would the gang say when they heard? He pictured himself standing
in the midst of them, an object of derision; he saw two of them meet
upon the street and heard the laugh that greeted the words, Larry
Murphys goin to school, like a kid. But he drove these visions from
him, muttering:

If they kid me, therell be somethin broke, thats all!

He half expected the principal to laugh when he stated his business;
but, on the contrary, that gentleman seemed to regard the matter
approvingly; this made Larry feel better, and he entered the schoolroom
indicated with scarcely a tremor. A number of young men of his own age
sat at the little desks, handling the spelling books with pathetic
care. There were two teachers in the room, flitting helpfully from
desk to desk; no one noticed Larry and he slid into a vacant seat, and
awaited developments.

One of the teachers was working from pupil to pupil up the aisle toward
him. His back was turned to her, but he knew, from the sound of her
voice, that she was young. In a few moments she was, as Larry afterward
expressed it, givin points to the guy right back o me.

It was not until then that he recognized the voice; and a panic
immediately possessed him.

Gee! he mentally exclaimed, what did I drift into this joint for,
anyhow; I might a-knowed shed be here. He looked longingly toward the
door. If I tought nobody was next, Id take a chance, and fly the
coop!

But he delayed until too late; in another moment Maggie had sat down
beside him, inquiring:

How are you getting on with--? then in great astonishment. Why,
Larry Murphy!

He began to stammer a confused explanation; but she knew of his
shortcomings and realized the situation like a flash.

I didnt tink Id see youse here, he finished awkwardly.

Maggie knew this; she also knew that if he had dreamed of her presence
wild horses could not have dragged him there. Her tact soon put him
more at his ease, and, finally her manner of putting things, awoke an
interest in the lessons that almost made him forget his situation.
