SCENE:
As we entered the great chamber at one end, Ko-tah and a handful of
warriors came in at the other, but we had the advantage, in that we
entered through a doorway directly behind the throne and upon the dais.

Throw your men upon the main entrance, I called to the officer of the
guard, and hold it until reinforcements come; and then, as the hundred
raced the length of the throne room toward the surprised and enraged
Ko-tah, I led Nah-ee-lah to the central throne and seated her upon it.
Then stepping forward, I raised my hand for silence.

The Jemadar Sagroth is dead! I cried. Behold Nah-ee-lah, the Jemadav
of Laythe!

Stop! cried Ko-tah, she may share the throne with me, but she may not
possess it alone.

Take that traitor! I called to the loyal guard, and they rushed
forward, evidently glad to do my bidding. But Ko-tah did not wait to be
taken. He was accompanied by only a handful of men, and when he saw that
the guard really intended to seize him and realized that he would be
given short shift at the hands of Nah-ee-lah and myself, he turned and
fled. But I knew he would come back, and come back he did, though not
until after the majority of the Jemadavs guard had gathered within the
throne room.

He came with a great concourse of warriors, and the fighting was
furious, but he might have brought a million men against our thousand
and not immediately have overcome us, since only a limited number could
fight at one time in the entrance way to the throne room. Already the
corpses lay stacked as high as a mans head, yet no single member of
Ko-tahs forces had crossed the threshold.

How long the fight was waged I do not know, but it must have been for a
considerable time, since I know that our men fought in relays and rested
many times, and that food was brought from other parts of the palace to
the doorway behind the throne, and there were times when Ko-tahs forces
withdrew and rested and recuperated, but always they came back in
greater number, and eventually I realized we must be worn down by the
persistence of their repeated attacks.

And then there arose slowly a deep-toned sound, at first we could not
interpret. It rose and fell in increasing volume, until finally we knew
that it was the sound of human voices, the voices of a great mobof a
mighty concourse of people and that it was sweeping toward us slowly and
resistlessly.

Closer and closer it approached the palace as it rose, terrace upon
terrace, toward the lofty pinnacle of Laythe. The fighting at the
entrance to the throne room had almost ceased. Both sides were worn down
almost to utter exhaustion, and now we but stood upon our arms upon
either side of the wall of corpses that lay between us, our attention
centered upon the sound of the growling multitude that was sweeping
slowly upward toward us.

They come, cried one of Nah-ee-lahs nobles, to acclaim the new
Jemadav and to tear the minions of Ko-tah the traitor to pieces!

He spoke in a loud voice that was easily audible to Ko-tah and his
retainers in the corridor without.

They come to drag the spawn of Sagroth from the throne! cried one of
Ko-tahs followers. And then from the throne came the sweet, clear voice
of Nah-ee-lah:

Let the peoples will be done, she said, and thus we stood, awaiting
the verdict of the populace. Nor had we long to wait, for presently we
realized that they had reached the palace terrace and entered the
building itself. We could hear the shouting horde moving through the
corridors and chambers, and finally the muffled bellowing resolved
itself into articulate words:

Sagroth is no more! Rule, Ko-tah, Jemadar of Laythe!

I turned in consternation toward Nah-ee-lah. What does it mean? I
cried. Have the people turned against you?

Ko-tahs minions have done their work well during these many kelds,
said the commander of the Jemadavs guard, who stood upon the upper
steps of the dais, just below the throne. They have spread lies and
sedition among the people which not even Sagroths just and kindly reign
could overcome.

Let the will of the people be done, repeated Nah-ee-lah.

It is the will of fools betrayed by a scoundrel, cried the commander
of the guard. While there beats a single heart beneath the tunic of a
guardsman of the Jemadav, we shall fight for Nah-ee-lah, Empress of
Laythe.

Ko-tahs forces, now augmented by the rabble, were pushing their way
over the corpses and into the throne room, so that we were forced to
join the defenders, that we might hold them off while life remained to
any of us. When the commander of the guard saw me fighting at his side
he asked me to return to Nah-ee-lah.
