What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
I cant eat that. How am I to hack at it with only one hand? he
growled, when the servant offered him some mutton.

Shall I cut it up for you, sir?

No, I wont have it; I dont want anything at all! said he, looking
with a frown at his wife, who turned from George to tell the servant
to bring the plate to her, and dutifully cut up the mutton, which her
sulky husband, without thanks, then condescended to eat.

Annie had put on a very pretty pale gray silk gown with elbow-sleeves
and square-cut bodice edged with dainty lace, and a long spray of pink
azalea fastened carelessly on one side of the neck. She was delighted
at the pleasure they all--except her morose husband, who tried hard
not to laugh when his brothers did at any speech of hers that amused
them--evidently took in her society; and she smiled and laughed and
chattered and looked so charming that not one of the men could keep his
eyes off her for more than a few moments at a time.

Have you seen anything of the Mainwarings, Annie? asked George, when
dinner was nearly over.

Oh, yes! I met Mrs. Mainwaring the other day with a volume of The
Band of Hope Review--I dont know whether you have heard of it--under
one arm. She said she thought of coming to read to Harry, if he would
like it, to cheer him up.

Something in Annies demure tone set them all laughing.

I said he would be delighted; but we didnt think too much excitement
was good for him just at first. And she asked if Sir George had any
good books in his library, and I said, Oh, yes! and she said I ought
to read some to him. I said I thought I ought, and I came back and read
him the _Sporting Dramatic News_ all through.

Oh, Annie, she wouldnt have you back in her schoolroom now!

No, indeed she would not! answered Annie promptly.

When she rose to leave the gentlemen, there was a little anxiety in her
manner as she glanced toward her husband. He was sitting with his eyes
fixed doggedly upon his plate, his face was already rather flushed, and
his hand was round the stem of a glass of Burgundy. She knew how little
weight a word from her was likely to have now; but it was her duty to
try, and she did try. As she passed him, she put out her left hand,
with its one ring--her wedding-ring, which decorum now forced her to
wear--lightly on his shoulder, and, as he gave no sign, she bent down
and slipped the slim white fingers gently up to his neck. He smelled
the faint perfume of the azalea on her breast, heard her quickened
breathing as he still hesitated.

Do you remember? she whispered softly.

He raised his eyes, sullenly still, to the little, pleading face.
She was irresistible at that moment, with her smiling lips and her
sparkling eyes, her head a little on one side in entreaty. There came
a flash from his eyes; her womanly fascination had won from him what
his promise would have failed to get. He got up, and, leaning on her
slight shoulder, let her lead him out of the room.

Annie was so much pleased with this unexpected little triumph that her
bright humor infected him now that he was alone with her; and, as she
dragged the easiest chair before the drawing-room fire for him, she
chattered on so that he had no time or inclination for the complaints
he was going to make against his brother Georges brutal indifference
to his illness. He was much annoyed when, in a very short time, they
heard the dining-room door open and the voices of the other three in
the hall.

Hang them all! They make so much noise. Annie, I think Ill go to bed;
and I want you to come and read to me.

But George had heard the last words as he came in.

No, no, Harry! Go to bed by all means, if you will; but you mustnt
make a victim of Annie. You have had my Lady Sunbeam all to yourself
for weeks; you must let her shed a few rays on the rest of us now.

Before Harry could make an angry reply, Annie broke in:

Harry has no wish to deprive you of such a very simple pleasure; I
will shed my rays upon you, as you poetically term it, by playing you
the very few new pieces I have learned since you last heard me, George.
And, Harry, you are feverish--you had better not stay up; I have
nothing to play that you have not heard, and I will come up and read
you to sleep by the time you are ready for me.

She rang the bell without giving him time to answer; and Harry, who was
really too worn out to make much resistance, grumblingly went off with
the servant, who lent a stout arm to his tottering master.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to show the conflict between George and Harry, and to establish Annie's character as a peacemaker.
