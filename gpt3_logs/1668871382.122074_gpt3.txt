SCENE:
X.

"_AFTER ALL, IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO MAKE A MAN HAPPY._"

For weeks to come neither Uncle Ramsay nor Walton had the heart to
add another sorrow to the Squire's cup of misery.  They knew that the
fire had but brought on a little sooner a catastrophe which was
already falling; they knew that Squire Broadbent was virtually a
ruined man.

All the machinery had been rendered useless; the most of the cattle
were dead; the stacks were gone; and yet, strange to say, the Squire
hoped on.  Those horses and cattle which had been saved were housed
now in rudely-built sheds, among the fire-blackened ruins of their
former wholesome stables and byres.

One day Branson, who had always been a confidential servant, sent
Mary in to say he wished to speak to the Squire.  His master came out
at once.

"Nothing else, Branson," he said.  "You carry a long face, man."

"The wet weather and the cold have done their work, sir.  Will you
walk down with me to the cattle-sheds?"

Arrived there, he pointed to a splendid fat ox, who stood in his
stall before his untouched turnips with hanging head and dry, parched
nose.  His hot breath was visible when he threw his head now and then
uneasily round towards his loin, as if in pain.  There was a visible
swelling on the rump.  Branson placed a hand on it, and the Squire
could hear it "bog" and crackle.

"What is that, Branson?  Has he been hurt?"

"No, sir, worse.  I'll show you."

He took out his sharp hunting-knife.

"It won't hurt the poor beast," he said.

Then he cut deep into the swelling.  The animal never moved.  No
blood followed the incision, but the gaping wound was black, and
filled with air-bubbles.

"The quarter-ill," said the cowman, who stood mournfully by.

That ox was dead in a few hours.  Another died next day, two the
next, and so on, though not in an increasing ratio; but in a month
there was hardly an animal alive about the place except the horses.

It was time now the Squire should know all, and he did.  He looked a
chastened man when he came out from that interview with his brother
and Walton.  But he put a right cheery face on matters when he told
his wife.

"We'll have to retrench," he said.  "It'll be a struggle for a time,
but we'll get over it right enough."

Present money, however, was wanted, and raised it must be.

And now came the hardest blow the Squire had yet received.  It was a
staggering one, though he met it boldly.  There was then at Burley
Old Mansion a long picture gallery.  It was a room in an upper story,
and extended the whole length of the house--a hall in fact, and one
that more than one Squire Broadbent had entertained his friends right
royally in.  From the walls not only did portraits of ancestors bold
and gay, smile or frown down, but there hung there also many a
splendid landscape and seascape by old masters.

Most of the latter had to be sold, and the gallery was closed, for
the simple reason that Squire Broadbent, courageous though he was,
could not look upon its bare and desecrated walls without a feeling
of sorrow.

Pictures even from the drawing-room had to go also, and that room too
was closed.  But the breakfast-room, which opened to the lawn and
rose gardens, where the wild birds sang so sweetly in summer, was
left intact; so was the dining-room, and that cosy, wee green parlour
in which the family delighted to assemble around the fire in the
winter's evenings.

Squire Broadbent had been always a favourite in the county--somewhat
of an upstart and iconoclast though he was--so the sympathy he
received was universal.

Iconoclast?  Yes, he had delighted in shivering the humble idols of
others, and now his own were cast down.  Nobody, however, deserted
him.  Farmers and Squires might have said among themselves that they
always knew Broadbent was "going the pace," and that his new-fangled
American notions were poorly suited to England, but in his presence
they did all they could to cheer him.
