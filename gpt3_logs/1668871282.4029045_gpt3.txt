Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
VI.

"_JOHNNIE'S GOT THE GRIT IN HIM._"

On the day of his fight with young Harry in the wood, Archie returned
home to find both his father and Mr. Walton in the drawing-room alone.

His father caught the lad by the arm.

"Been tumbling again off that pony of yours?"

"No, father, worse.  I'm sure I've done wrong."

He then told them all about the practical joking, and the _finale_.

"Well," said the Squire, "there is only one verdict.  What do you
say, Walton?"

"Serve him right!"

"Oh, I know that," said Archie; "but isn't it lowering our name to
keep such company?"

"It isn't raising our name, nor growing fresh laurels either, for you
to play practical jokes on this poor London lad.  But as to being in
his company, Archie, you may have to be in worse yet.  But listen!  I
want my son to behave as a gentleman, even in low company.  Remember
that boy, and despise no one, whatever be his rank in life.  Now, go
and beg your mother's and sister's forgiveness for having to appear
before them with a black-eye."

"Archie!" his father called after him, as he was leaving the room.

"Yes, dad?"

"How long do you think it will be before you get into another scrape?"

"I couldn't say for certain, father.  I'm sure I don't want to get
into any.  They just seem to come."

"There's no doubt about one thing, Mr. Broadbent," said the tutor
smiling, when Archie had left.

"And that is?"

"He's what everybody says he is, a chip of the old block.
Headstrong, and all that; doesn't look before he leaps."

"Don't _I_, Walton?"

"Squire, I'm not going to flatter you.  You know you don't."

"Well, my worthy secretary," said the Squire, "I'm glad you speak so
plainly.  I can always come to you for advice when----"

"When you want to," said Walton, laughing.  "All right, mind you do.
I'm proud to be your factor, as well as tutor to your boys.  Now what
about that Chillingham bull?  You won't turn him into the west field?"

"Why not?  The field is well fenced.  All our picturesque beasts are
there.  He is only a show animal, and he is really only a baby."

"True, the bull is not much more than a baby, but----"

The baby in question was the gift of a noble friend to Squire
Broadbent; and so beautiful and picturesque did he consider him, that
he would have permitted him to roam about the lawns, if there did not
exist the considerable probability that he would play battledore and
shuttlecock with the visitors, and perhaps toss old Kate herself over
the garden wall.

So he was relegated to the west field.  This really was a park to all
appearance.  A few pet cattle grazed in it, a flock of sheep, and a
little herd of deer.  They all lived amicably together, and sought
shelter under the same spreading trees from the summer's sun.  The
cattle were often changed, so were the sheep, but the deer were as
much fixtures as the trees themselves.

The changing of sheep or cattle meant fine fun for Archie.  He would
be there in all his glory, doing the work that was properly that of
herdsmen and collie dogs.  There really was not a great deal of need
for collies when Archie was there, mounted on his wild Shetland pony,
his darling "Eider Duck" Scallowa; and it was admittedly a fine sight
to see the pair of them--they seemed made for each other--feathering
away across the field, heading and turning the drove.  At such times
he would be armed with a long whip, and occasionally a beast more
rampageous than the rest would separate itself from the herd, and,
with tail erect and head down, dash madly over the grass.  This would
be just the test for Archie's skill that he longed for.  Away he
would go at a glorious gallop; sometimes riding neck and neck with
the runaway and plying the whip, at other times getting round and
well ahead across the beast's bows with shout and yell, but taking
care to manoeuvre so as to steer clear of an ugly rush.
