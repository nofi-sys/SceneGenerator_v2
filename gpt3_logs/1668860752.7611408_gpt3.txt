SCENE:
This was Captain Jareds great point in his antagonism to the war
policy of the national government. His prolonged idleness was having a
bad effect on his temper and the gallant old seaman was always ready
and willing to argue at any length in support of his views. Not many
cared to enter the lists with the captain; but Peter Walker, a strong
supporter of the administration and Jareds foremost opponent, remarked:

The President has more sense than to listen to such people as Cale
Strong, Jared, and theres lots of people on Cape Cod who dont think
much of the same Cale.

Is that so, Peter? Captain Jared turned fiercely to where Peter sat
in his accustomed place. Everybody knows that you cant lose much by
the war. What is it to you if the British destroy the salt works? You
took good care to sell your share in the salt business to Ed. Clark,
though Im not saying that you did so on account of the war. Still,
if a man has so little to lose as you have in that way, it dont seem
right for him to find fault with those who suffer most.

Peters goodhumor was proof against this assault. Well, Jared, he
replied, I think I gave Ed. quite a good bargain in the matter, and
he seemed to be satisfied. What I want to show you is this: Strong
received 53 votes at the last election and Dexter got 31. That was
the vote of Eastham and it shows that there are thirty voters besides
myself who agree with the President of the United States as against
Governor Strong.

Im willing to bet that most of the thirty owe you money for
horseshoeing! retorted Captain Jared, and, anyway, Peter, tis easy
to tell who they are; they are your cronies who spend most of their
time in your shop listening to your rhymes making fun of the neighbors,
and enjoying it, too. The fools dont know that youll be after
themselves soon!

Roars of laughter greeted this thrust at Peter and Obed Sparrow cried:

Thats right, Captain Jared! you are the man to down Peter.

Jared gave Obed a withering glance. Good Lord, Obed Sparrow! he
exclaimed, to think of your putting in your oar when you just echo
every word that comes from Peters mouth! Ill give Peter the credit of
being able to twist you and your fellows about his little finger when
he wants your votes; but by George, thats no reason why you should
interfere in this argument.

Obed looked crestfallen at this rebuke. Peter rallied to his support.

Why, Jared, Obed is one of the most independent men in this town,
and you know it. Obeds vote isnt for sale like some others we know
that followed the Strong party, and I dont mean you by that, Captain
Higgins.

Obed was grateful for this testimony to his integrity. He plucked up
courage to return to the fray.

Thank you, Master Walker. I suppose Captain Jared also believes that
you made the Orleans voters go against Strong! That town gave 101 for
Dexter and only 21 for Strong. If all the people there who went against
Cale Strong owe you money you must have a lot of names on your books!

Dont talk to me about Orleans, Obed Sparrow, cried Captain Jared;
they are the most pig-headed of all the war party. Simeon Kingman is a
firebrand and he is ably assisted by John Kenrick.

If Squire Kingman and Master John Kenrick are firebrands, Captain
Jared, they are backed by their townsmen in the firing. They have
always been leading men in their town and they wouldnt be if they
didnt prove themselves worthy.

Im not saying anything against their characters, Obed. They are
friends of mine though I dont agree with their politics. They think
they can defy the British fleet! Any fool should know that you cant
beat off a heavily armed force with a few old muskets, and, so far as I
know, thats about all the arms they have.

Then you dont believe in fighting, Captain Jared?

Obed, you are a young man and you have proved yourself a brave man.
I have no right to find fault with you for asking that question, but
in my young days we were taught to believe that men whose gray beards
betokened years of experience behind them had seen some of the ups and
downs of life and could fairly advise us in our troubles. I am close to
my seventieth year and in my time I have seen bloody deeds done afloat
and ashore. Like you, at one time I thought the quick answer and the
ready blow most became a man, and even yet I think there are occasions
when there is no other course open to a man of honor. It was on such
an occasion that I got this wound, Obed; but the Barbary pirate who
inflicted it never lived to harm anybody else.

There was intense silence as Captain Jared opened his shirt front and
displayed a terrible scar across his chest.
