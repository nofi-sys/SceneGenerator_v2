SCENE:
This is the library, Maida announced proudly.

Id like to shut myself up here for a month, Dicky, who was a great
reader, said wistfully. It looks as if all the books were interesting.

Oh they are! Maida assured him. The Lang Fairy Books and Grimm and
Andersen, George McDonald and Louisa M. Alcott and Howard Pyle and
Stevenson and Kipling, and all the nicest books that father and Billy
Potter and Dr. Pierce and I could think of. And lots more that they
selected that I had never heard of.

From the library, they went out doors through the little vine-covered
vestibule.

From upstairs came the voice of Granny Flynn and Mrs. Dore putting the
younger children to bed.

We three girls, Maida explained, have rooms at the front of the
house on the second floor. The nursery is back over the dining room.

Where do we sleep? Harold asked.

You boys, Maida replied, are going to sleep in the barn.

Gee _whillikins_! Dicky exclaimed. What fun thatll be!

Id rather sleep in a barn than any place I know, Arthur said.

Its pretty good fun sleeping in a tent, Harold threw in.

I was going to say, Arthur went on, except out of doors in the
woods.

Now which shall I show you first, Maida asked, the boys rooms or
the girls rooms? She did not wait for an answer. Come on girls, she
continued in a tone of resignation. Weve got to show the boys their
place first. They wont look at anything until theyve seen them!

The procession moved toward the barn.

The lower floor--roomy, raftered, sweet-smelling--was empty except
for the canoes; a small run-about; the bicycles; a phonograph; a big
chest; garden tools. Maida led the way to the second floor. The railed
stairway ran close to the side of the barn, brought them through a
square opening in the ceiling, into another big room--the second story.
Here, in each of three corners, were army cots; beside each cot, a
tall chiffonier. On top of each chiffonier were toilet articles in a
simple style; beside each chiffonier a chair.

Thats your bathroom over there. Maida pointed to the fourth corner
which was partitioned off. It has a shower. I dont expect youll use
it much because well be bathing every day in the Magic Mirror. You
hang your clothes on hooks behind these curtains. You see you each have
a closet of your own.

The boys were of course opening chiffonier drawers; pulling aside
curtain-draped closets; examining the shower. Their curiosity appeased,
they made for down-stairs--and the canoes.

Now while you boys are examining the barn, would you girls like to
explore upstairs in the house? Maida asked.

Im just dying to see my own room, Laura declared firmly.

The two girls pelted across the lawn in the wake of Maidas eager
footsteps. They ran up the tiny steep flight of stairs, exactly
opposite the little vestibule entrance. It brought them into a small
hall from which opened four small slant-roofed chambers.

This is my room, Maida said, pointing to one of the south
chambers--the back room on the right of the stairs. I have always
slept there when we have been in the house. I love it because of the
great tree outside my window. I have always called this tree, Mother
Nature, to go with Father Time. So you see I have a father tree and a
mother tree! When theres a storm the boughs make such a sweet sound
rubbing against my walls. And often little twigs tap on my window, and
sometimes it sounds exactly as though the leaves were whispering to me.

Oh Maida! Rosie exclaimed, I never saw anything so lovely in all my
life. How I love that bed and that sweet little cricket.

The room was simple--it held but a big, double, old-fashioned canopied
bed; an old-fashioned maple bureau; and an old-fashioned maple desk;
a little straight slat-backed chair in front of the desk and a little
slat-backed rocker by one of the windows--but it was quaint. In front
of the rocker was a cricket as though just ready for little feet.

The flowered wall-paper matched the chintz curtains and the chintz
ruffles on the little cricket. Under the window, in a little
old-fashioned childs chair, sat a great rag doll, and beside her was a
little hair-cloth trunk.
