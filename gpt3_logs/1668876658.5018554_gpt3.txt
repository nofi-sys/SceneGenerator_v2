Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Fay gulped and glanced at the lieutenant-commander. By what right, he
asked, does this man take me from this ship? Im an American!

Five years in Dartmoor, said MacKeenon dryly. A hae no doot itll be
that many more. Did ye get what ye went after?

The question was shot through thin lips. The pouches on the sides of the
inspectors jaw distended and contracted. He bared his gums like a wise
old hound. His eyes narrowed to slits.

Did ye get it? he repeated as his arm shot out and clutched the
cracksmans shoulder.

Fay jerked away and turned. Some of the passengers had come forward and
were curiously staring at him. Others peered out from the open doors of
staterooms. A boswain stood near by, with a long belaying-pin. He toyed
with this weapon suggestively.

I got it! said Fay, turning back to MacKeenon. Oh, yes, I got it! I
got what you sent me for. You know I got it!

So does the police of that citysouth and east of here. Why mon, ye
made a terrible job of it. A could have done better myself. A was
surprised, after what I expected of you. Fortunately A had that stick o
mine handy, or else theyd of caught ye red-handed.

Fay smiled with engaging warmth. Thanks for that, he said. It was a
good turn, but it deserved a better. What reason have I to leave this
ship? Suppose I open my mouth and tell what I know.

Yell never do that! snapped MacKeenon cautiously. Yell never
squealA know that to be a fact. Come on now, Chester, with me. Get your
luggage and come on. Youre under arrest!

The inspector threw back his coat and showed the gold insignia of
Scotland Yard. He dropped his coat lapel and pointed a steady finger
toward the destroyer whose deck was directly beneath the great ships
rail.

Come on, mon! he ordered.

Hell not go!

MacKeenon turned and stared forward. Saidee Isaacs had thrust herself
through the curious passengers. She glided to Fays side and repeated
her declaration:

Hell not go!

Whattwa o them, MacKeenon said softly. Twa suspects on one boat.
Captain, A hae the honor of arresting them both. The lieutenant will
show his authority from the Admiralty. It was signed only yesterday. A
weary stretch of ocean we have come over. It was only by chance we held
your course in the fog. A was on the point of requesting the officer to
proceed to Stavanger.

The captain saw no way out of the difficulty. He turned to Fay and said
with salty vigor:

Get your luggage and do as they request. Ill report the matter to my
government. England is mistress of these seas by the terms of the peace
treaties. I cant hold my boat any longer.

Youre a coward! said Saidee Isaacs, stamping her foot on the deck.
This man has done nothing.

Weil! Weil! MacKeenon chuckled. Miss Isaacs has changed a wee bit
since last A saw her. She was willing to help trap a cracksman and now
shes rounded on the Yard. Ayl attend to her!

The girl turned swiftly to Fay. We have no luggage, she said. Well
go! But never a word will we say. Remember, Chester, I will say nothing
without you being present. Remember that!

A verra clever remark, intonated MacKeenon. Twa thieves are far worse
than one.

Fay followed the girl to the rail where the boswains ladder was
lashed. He assisted her to climb down until he was forced to let go her
hands. Her upturned face was close to his as he leaned over the rail.
Her eyes were loyal and smouldering with rage toward MacKeenon. Her
cheeks flushed through the olive-hue of her skin. Her lips were set and
almost hard. She flashed a sudden smile, and, turning her head, glanced
downward to where the seamen of the destroyer had maneuvered the
small-boat. They grappled the ladder with a boat-hook. She waited and
sprang outward. She landed in the stern and grasped the gunwale. She
stared upward with concern as Fay descended the swaying ladder.

He reached her side and waited. MacKeenon and the lieutenant-commander
came down the ladder and leaped for the bow of the boat. It was shoved
away from the rusty sheer of the giant ship. A bell clanged as the
captain hurried forward along the upper rail. The screw thrashed the
waves. The ship surged on. Its stern showed with gold letters marking
the name:


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Fay is arrested by Inspector MacKeenon and taken from the ship. Saidee Isaacs accompanies him, and they are both taken to the destroyer.
