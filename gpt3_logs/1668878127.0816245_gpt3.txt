SCENE:
Period, said Teddy, and lapsed once more into silence.

Roy took a firm stand upon the ledge. He had already attached the
stone to the line and had removed the cork from the fortunately
large hook. Now he drew back his arm, took careful aim, and threw.
The line whistled out, then sagged as the stone struck the ground.

Make it? Teddy asked, not deigning to arise.

Missed, was the laconic reply. Give me time.

Certainly. We have weeks at our disposal. Ive got nothing to do
but sit here, anyway.

Roy grinned good-naturedly and drew the line in. Once more he cast.

Ive got those bears worried, at any rate, he declared, pulling in
for a third attempt. Notice how quiet they are?

Teddy nodded solemnly.

Sure. They just decided which one was going to have me for lunch.
Ill bet the first bear won. He likes me. Tried to kiss me on the
way up, but I was bashful, and, anyway, we were in a hurry.

Once more the line whistled through the air. This time, when it
landed, Roy gave a yell.

_Thats_ the one! Watch this now, Teddy, and give me credit!

Teddy, jarred out of his placidity, leaped to his feet. He saw that
the hook had come to rest about five feet below the gun, and in a
direct line with the trigger guard.

Boy--take it easy! he breathed. Pull up slow--slo-o-o-w! A little
more--no--dont jerk it--gently now--

Well, for the love of Pete, will you pipe down for a second? Roy
exploded, a grin of amusement on his face. How do you think I can
do this with you yelling in my ear? First you sit back and let me do
all the work, and then, by golly, you want to play director. Hey,
iss diss a system?

Pardon, Teddy replied, mockingly contrite. You are right. I am at
fault, and I await your pleasure. Henceforth I keep my peace.

With a smile of satisfaction, Roy returned once more to the business
of catching the hook in the trigger guard. Slowly he drew in. The
hook neared the rifle. Then, with a foot more to go, it caught on
the edge of a stone, and stuck. Carefully Roy twitched the line,
hoping to dislodge it. But the hook resisted all his efforts. Both
boys took a deep breath. Below them the bears started their growling
again, and stones and dirt clattered down the mountain as they
leaped repeatedly up toward the ledge.

Now may the gods of the hills be with us, Teddy murmured. I fear
me those bears have formed a conspiracy against us!

Roy jerked the line desperately. If it parted, their last hope was
gone. They would have to remain on the ledge until the bears left of
their own accord or until the animals succeeded in their objective.
Roy shuddered slightly as he thought of this last eventuality.
_That_ would not be so pleasant.

Lets try it, Teddy suggested hoarsely, afraid almost that his
voice would cut the line. He took the cord from his brothers
unresisting hand.

For a moment it seemed that he would have no greater success than
Roy. The hook appeared caught firmly. Then, resolutely, Teddy gave
the line a violent tug.

The hook released its tenacious hold on the stone and snapped
through the air. Teddy gave a gasp of dismay. Then, suddenly, his
face cleared and his eyes lit joyfully. He gave a shout of triumph.

The hook, leaping toward the rifle, had become attached to the
trigger guard!

Got it! Teddy yelled. Dont know how, but I did! Now, Roy, well
see just how much this plan of yours is worth! Here, gun, gun, gun,
gun, gun! Come to papa! Whoa, baby, not so fast! Thats the stuff!
Nice rifle!

By fits and starts, the rifle, drawn by the fishline, made its
eccentric way up the mountainside. Gradually it approached a spot
just under the ledge where both bears were waiting, crouched against
the wall, staring frantically at this strange manifestation. Never
before had they seen a stick travel uphill apparently under its own
guidance.
