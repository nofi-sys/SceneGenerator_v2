SCENE:
The manager came forward and assisted her from the platform, amid a buzz
of excitement in the audience, returning in a few moments to announce
that Madame Lucien had been affected by the heat of the room and would
be unable to continue the reading, but he would introduce in her place
the trance medium Mr. Eugene Potts, who was both clairvoyant and
audient.

While this scene was transpiring in Boxwell Hall, Major Walden was
hurrying down the street as though driven by a legion of furies. He felt
that he must get away or do that for which he might be sorry. On, on he
walked, heeding not his direction or whereabouts. He was fleeing from
her and from this nightmare of horror which beset him. And the vision
before his eyes of the pale, spirituelle face of his lost one kept pace
with him. He could not escape it.

An hour later he had turned his steps homeward. He had walked away the
uncontrollable emotion which had possessed him at the sight of Agnes,
and a calmer spirit prevailed. He had decided that it was better that he
should not meet her again. He would go to his office and write her
fully, and send her again the letter which he had sent to her Eastern
home and which had been returned to him through the dead letter office
but a few days before this. She should know how completely he had been
punished for his lack of trust in her, and should forgive him, if her
sweet, forgiving nature could do so.

The people were returning from the hall. He stepped into the shadow of a
doorway and waited for the crowd to pass by and the street to become
once more deserted. He realized he scanned each face and figure closely.
Was he hoping to see her? No, it were better that he did not; he had
settled that question, but now, in the struggle with himself.

The street lamps flamed and flickered, casting weird shadows on the
darkened buildings of the business street where he stood. Ahead of him,
as he again started forward, he saw a solitary individual stop under a
light and take a letter from his pocket, which, leaning against the
lamp-post, he began to read. Something in his figure and attitude
arrested Major Waldens attention. He looked at him searchingly as he
approached him. At the moment the man, hearing his footsteps, turned his
face from the letter toward him.

A flame of angry fire shot from the Majors brain to each prescient
nerve and muscle of his being. With a spring he was upon the man, his
hand upon his throat.

Ah, ha! You miserable, white-livered abomination! It is well I have
found you now,now, when your victim is here in this city,you
fiend-ambassador of Satan! Killing is too good for you!

The attack was so sudden the victim had no chance to cry out, and sank
to the ground, with no show of resistance, the Majors hand in a
death-grip upon his throat, shutting off breath from his lungs.

Take thatand thatand that! cried Walden, raining the blows with his
clenched fist upon the others face and shoulders. I shall kill you! do
you hear?

The victim struggled, his eyes, protruding from their sockets, pleaded
for mercy, and his speechless tongue hung swollen from his lips. Voices
were heard approaching him, but the infuriated and frenzied man did not
heed them. The higher man had, for the time, been lost in the maddened
animal.

You snake! It is a joy to throttle you, to see your lying tongue
palsied! Your forked tongue that has stung with its venom Gods best and
purest. A thousand deaths could not pay for the ruin you have made, you
viper! and the Majors eyes, red with passion and fury, glared into the
terrified ones beneath him.

It is a fearful thing to see a man, made in the image of God, unchain
the passions of his soul and allow them to control him. Major Walden
was, for the time, a madman.

Hold on, whats the matter here? cried a voice, and a hand grasped the
collar of the would-be murderer.

I should think the fellow was holding on with a vengeance, said
another voice. Come, let up that fellow, or youll be an assassin.

Releasing his hand from his victims throat, Major Walden wrenched
himself free from the intruders clutch, and planting his foot upon the
prostrate man, turned defiantly.

Is it murder to kill a reptilea miserable, venomous viper? he hissed.

Good God! It is the Major. Have you gone mad, friend? What does this
mean?

It means that Ive nearly or quite squeezed the life out of that
villain Teasdale. Ill assure you I shall not let him go till Ive
finished him.
