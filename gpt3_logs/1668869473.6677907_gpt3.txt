Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
"We had trouble at once from the lack of our knives, for the coils of
all halyards had been stopped up clear of the deck, and we had to untie
these while the three bullies of the after-guard yelled at us. Seas
began boarding us, too, and that made matters worse. But finally we
got the two royals, the gafftopsail, and the flying jib down, and the
courses clewed up; but while the latter was being done, I and two of
the small fry went aloft to furl, my job being the fore royal. I furled
it, and had started down, when I looked below, and saw the whole crowd
on deck fighting the two mates, with the helmsman running forward to
join the row, leaving the skipper at the wheel.

"I slid down by the royal backstay, for while I had no great
fellow-feeling for the officers, still, they were my countrymen, and
I had no desire to take part in mutiny. Before I reached the deck,
however, the fight was over, as far the mates were concerned. They were
running aft, for their guns, I suppose, while all but Pango Sam lay
stretched out on the deck, and he met me at the rail with murder in his
eyes, knowing instinctively, I suppose, that I was not on his side.

"As I jumped to the deck and reached for a belaying pin, he grabbed
me. I was utterly helpless in the grasp of that giant. He roared
inarticulately, and frothed at the mouth as he lifted me at full length
over his head, to dash me to the deck.

"But, as I told you, I merely slid down, to paralyze my crazy bone on
hard ice--ice, remember, in the tropics. When I picked myself up Pango
Sam was still standing, but dead and stiff, his feet frozen in the ice
that covered the deck. Then I saw our passenger flat on his back. He
never recovered his reason. His last intelligent speech was given as he
fell to the deck, which was about a second or so after I fell myself.
While at the wheel, a few days later, I heard the skipper quote it to
the mate. It was: 'God have mercy upon my soul!' After that he uttered
nothing but gibberish."

Behind us the sound of footsteps came to our ears: but before we could
turn, or arise, a voice, fervent and agonized, repeated: "God have
mercy upon my soul!" And Old Bill launched headlong between us, and
lay unconscious on the floor at the foot of the easel.

"Another spell," said my neighbor. "It was coming to him, I guess. Help
me lift him to your couch."

We laid the old fellow on the couch, where he lay with every indication
of a fainting spell. But, though we worked over him for a time, he did
not come out of it. He did not seem to be in a natural sleep, either,
for his breath was too faint, his pulse too irregular. We watched him
with growing disquiet for a while, then telephoned to the nearest
hospital. Old Bill was taken away, still unconscious, and all we could
do was to put him from our minds with the mental reservation that we
would visit him.

We did not visit him. Work, engagements, the eternal scramble for money
incidental to the life of every man who works for himself, prevented
my neighbor and me from getting together for the visit. In a month,
however, Old Bill visited us as we sat, discussing my picture; but we
hardly recognized him, and, on his part, he did not recognize us at all.

His old face, though still wrinkled and withered, bore an alert,
intelligent look far removed from the dull, stupid expression we had
known; he was clad in well-fitting garments late from the tailor. He
carried a cane, and on his hands were gloves which, as he removed them,
showed fingers thick and stubby, but with the unmistakable signs of
recent manicuring.

"Pardon me, gentlemen," he said, as he looked us over, "but I have
been directed to this studio by an ambulance surgeon as the place from
which I was taken in a comatose condition about a month ago. I wakened
a few days later with the memories, the consciousness--the ego, I might
say--of a young man of twenty-five. Had not that ego been in a good,
stable condition I might have gone mad when I saw my old face in a
mirror, and realized that I had lost fifty years of my life.

"Since then, however, I have been re-establishing my old connections,
and I am now trying to learn what I have been, where I have been,
and who I have been. Can you tell me anything? I am, or was once, a
Methodist clergyman, named Franklin Mayhew; but I fear that I have
forfeited the title of reverend."

"What?" exclaimed my neighbor. We had both risen to our feet, to stare
at the metamorphosed Old Bill, but now we sat down, rather weak in the
legs. I had the grace to motion our visitor to a chair.

"If you are the Reverend Franklin Mayhew," continued my neighbor, "did
you once take passage in the bark _Rangoon_ at Batavia, bound to Cape
Town?"

"I did, and by my chronology it was but a month ago. The terrible
scenes on board that vessel were the first things that came to my mind
when I wakened in the hospital. Do you know anything about it? I want
to know what happened to me."


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

A man named Franklin Mayhew wakes up in a hospital a month after he was taken there in a coma. He has no memories of the past 50 years, but he does remember taking a passage on the bark Rangoon. He asks the two men in the studio if they know what happened to him on the ship, and they tell him the story.
