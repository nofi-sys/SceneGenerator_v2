SCENE:
Mark frowned, and chewed his mustache reflectively, but he repressed the
words that came to his lips.

My dear child, I am home with you now.

Yes, Mark, and I am sosoglad! But you will go away and then they will
come again.

I wish you might go when I do. You are nearly ill with nervous
prostration. You should see a doctor right away.

O, no, Mark! Not a doctor! I am not sick!

What has caused this trouble, Alice? I do not know unless it is that
miserable hound Russell. Can you not believe me when I tell you this is
all a mere delusion of the senses? You have thought and thought over,
and allowed your mind to dwell upon that wretched _ism_ until it has
nearly shipwrecked you. It was an evil day when that villain darkened
our door. And Mark ground his teeth in impotent wrath. But come, let
us have a light and drive away the spirits of darkness.

But, Mark, dear, said Alice, as she arose and lighted a lamp, can you
not see that, to me, it is truth? I really see and hear them, and if it
were not for these hideous ones

They are _all_ hideousthe whole doctrine is hideous, my dear, and only
such as an unbalanced mind can conceive of, he said hastily. For my
sake,for Gods sake,try and use some reason and judgment in the
matter! You used to feel different from thisyou, the little fearless
woman of five years ago. I was so proud of you for your bravery, as
became a soldiers wife. You were all right until that man came
hereuntil that serpent came into our Eden. Now you are frightened, and
faint at your own shadow. But forgive me, dear, I didnt come home to
scold you. I am sure it is because you are not well and your nerves are
to blame for it all. Queer things, these nerves, to play us such pranks.
You are better, are you not?

Alice turned her face, still pale and wan, toward him, and said in a
voice yet unsteady: We will not talk of it any more. It is too
dreadful.

No, we will choose pleasanter themes. I have some news for you. I have
received a letter from my sister Elinor, and she thinks of coming to
make us a visit. She will have a fine rest here after her round of
society life.

But I thought she was in California.

So she is, but will stop and visit us on the way East. I know it will
do you good to have her here. She is always bright and happy.

Alices lip quivered at the implied reproach, though Mark had no
intention of meaning it as such.

But will she be happy here? I am afraid our rude little cabin will
scarcely make her comfortable.

Dont worry about that, child. Nellie is a good-hearted little woman,
in spite of her wealth and love of society, and she will enjoy the
change, I assure you.

I feelafraid to see her, said Alice, the tears quivering in her
lashes.

Alice, dear, can it be this lonely, isolated life that is ruining your
health and nerves? Shall I give up my commission and go back East?

Oh, no, Mark! It is pleasant hereonly And Alice again looked
apprehensively behind her.

My poor child, we will go East,anywhere,to get you away from these
scenes and influences, he murmured.

But, Mark, do you not think they are everywhere? In the East and West
and North and South? The air is full of them, it seems to me. What used
to seem only thin, pure, fresh air, sweet to breathe, and space vast and
limitless, appears now a thickly populated ether or chaos in which are
countless thousands of spirits floating or coming and going in surging,
whirling, maddening confusion. Oh, you cannot see with my eyes! If you
could you would pity me! Alice leaned against her husbands arm and her
tears fell softly. You wouldnt scold me if you knew.

Poor child, poor child! I will not scold you nor laugh at you. I will
cure you. I know disordered nerves are as bad as other functional
disorders, or worse, and it is a physician you need, and a big dose of
rest, and you shall have them. You shall not be left alone again,
either. You are not afraid when I am here?

No, you seem to exercise control even over the inhabitants of the air.
