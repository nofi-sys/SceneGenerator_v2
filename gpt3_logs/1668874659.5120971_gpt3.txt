Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
There stood the grave, sedate, prematurely old governess of half an
hour before panting with laughter and exertion in the pause after a
game of shuttlecock. There was no mistaking the fact; for she still
held the battledoor in one hand while she rallied William on his
clumsiness.

If you try to catch it so, you must miss it, and perhaps lose your
balance, besides exhibiting yourself in an extremely ungraceful
attitude; and she threw out her arms in laughing imitation of him in
the act of saving himself from a fall. Now try again. Are you ready?

Yes, I should think so! You shant laugh at me this time!

The game began again. The shuttlecock was tossed from the one to the
other amid cries and more laughter, both combatants being nimble, quick
of eye and hand, and as much excited as if their very lives depended
on the keeping up of the flimsy thing of leather and feathers. Harrys
own breath came and went as fast as theirs as he watched, not the game,
but the graceful, active little player in white, whose movements in the
_abandon_ of the game had a fascination such as no famous dancer he had
ever seen had exercised upon him; and when, as, once more pausing, the
shuttlecock fell to the ground, she stood panting under the soft light
of a Chinese lantern, her cheeks flushed, her dark eyes sparkling, her
beautiful brown hair shining as her head moved, and her lips parted
with smiles, the blood mounted to his face, and he watched her, with
all the passionate admiration of his twenty years in his heart and in
his eyes. He dared not move; he would not for the world have broken the
charm by letting her know that the game had a spectator.

A minute later the shuttlecock was flying again. Opposite to the door
where Harry was standing hidden was another door; and, as, with her
eyes fixed upon the toy in the air above her head, Miss Lane tripped
backward against the curtain, her foot caught in its folds, she
stumbled, and might have fallen, had not an arm from behind the curtain
caught and saved her. It was Georges. He had taken up his position
just as his brother had taken his a few minutes later, at the opposite
door.

Quick as thought, Miss Lane had shrunk at the touch of the unexpected
hand into the shell of demure propriety she generally wore.

She showed not even surprise, only a little shame and confusion.

Thank you. I am much obliged to you, said she, modestly, without
raising her eyes, extricating herself gently from the obliging arm.
I--I caught the curtain with my foot.

Are you sure you have not twisted your ankle? asked George, bending
down over her with great solicitude.

Quite, thank you.

George bowed his handsome head still lower, and murmured mischievously.

Now I see why I couldnt amuse you at dinner. It was because I cant
talk about shuttlecocks!

She colored, but made no answer, except by a mischievous smile as she
raised her eyes to his face. Harry came out from behind his curtain.

Will you come and have a game at billiards, Miss Lane? Ill teach you.

I can play a little; but I musnt now, thank you. I must go back to
the Vicarage.

How anxious you are to get away from us! said George.

Oh, indeed, it is not that! I havent been so happy for, oh, I dont
know how long, as I have been here to-day!

Then why are you in such a hurry to get away?

I am not in a hurry; it is because I must go, said she, the almost
child-like gayety quite gone out of her voice, which remained sweet,
but low and grave; besides, I--I ought not to have enjoyed myself so
much. I had forgotten.

Forgotten what? said George, kindly.

To-day--my confirmation. It was wrong, very wrong of me! Such an
example for my pupil Betty, too!

George could not help smiling.

I dont think your bad example would do much harm to Betty, Miss Lane.
I dare say she wishes she had a chance of spending her evening in the
same way.

I am afraid she does, said the governess, simply.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The scene takes place at a grave, where the governess from before is playing shuttlecock with William. They are laughing and having a good time, when Harry, who has been watching them secretly, comes out from his hiding place. He invites the governess to play billiards with him, but she declines, saying she must go back to the Vicarage. George, who has also been watching them, comes out from his hiding place and teases the governess about her hurry to leave. She says she's happy but must go because she forgot it's the day of her confirmation. George smiles and tells her Betty, her pupil, probably wishes she could spend her evening the same way. The governess agrees.
