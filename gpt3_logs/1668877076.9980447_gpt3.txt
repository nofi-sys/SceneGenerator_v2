SCENE:
XVII

BASEBALL, TENNIS AND OYSTERS


There was yet nearly three-quarters of an hour before supper time and
Dud, still elated and excited over the track victory, turned his steps
to River Street and, skirting the school grounds, swung west and made
for the station. The ball team, unless it missed its connection at the
Junction, would be in at a quarter to six. Dud was not alone in his
journey to the station, for the carriages bearing the Mount Morris
athletes passed him half-way along the shaded village road and several
boys, fortunate youths living nearby who had procured leave of absence
over Sunday, were trailing along, suit-cases in hand. Dud witnessed
the departure of the Mount Morris track team and the fellows off for
home and then, seated on a baggage-truck, watched the shadows creep
down the hillside across the tracks and thought of a great many things.
He speculated on what had happened at Rotan to result in Graftons
defeat, wondered whether by any stroke of fortune the Scarlet-and-Gray
had redeemed herself in the later innings and then tried to imagine
himself in the box for Grafton, facing those doughty Rotan freshies
and mowing them down one-two-three! He couldnt quite visualize the
scene, however, and gave up with a sigh. Then he wondered how long it
would be before Mr. Sargent would let him start a game, and what would
happen when he did! And at that instant there was a whistle far down
the track, the few loiterers came to life along the platform and the
baggage man requisitioned his truck.

Jimmie was one of the first off the train and was all for returning
to school in the barge until Dud reminded him that he had walked all
the way over to meet him and didnt propose to pay any fifteen cents
to ride back. Whereupon Jimmie good-naturedly set out with his chum on
foot.

Twelve to seven, he answered in reply to Duds request for the final
figures. What was the matter? Why, nothing much, except that we
couldnt hit that pitcher of theirs and they slammed Myatt all over
the lot in the third. Why the dickens Pete didnt yank him out I dont
know. Maybe its just as well he didnt, though. I guess theyd have
battered Leddy something brutal. Those dubs sure can hit the pill, son!

How did you get on? asked Dud.

Rotten, thanks! I muffed a peach of a fly and let two runs cross,
worse luck! It was in that awful third. The sun got square in my eyes
just at the last moment. I had the old thing sighted nicely until I
had to drop my hands to make the catch. Then it went plum through
em. There were three on bases and so two of them scored. The other
one could have, too, if hed had any sense, for it took me about ten
seconds to find the ball after I muffed it. But the fellow slowed up at
third and by that time it was too late.

Did you hit any?

I got one, and it was a corker. Id have had two bases on it if Blake
hadnt held me up at first, the chump! I wasnt awfully strong with the
stick, Dud, but I got a base every time I went up!

You did? How, for pitys sake?

Well, the first time I rolled one in front of base and the catcher
threw to second to get Ordway. He didnt, though, for Hobos a regular
flash on the bases, and we were both safe. The next time I got pinked
in the arm, the next time I hit between short and thirdsome little
sizzler, that was, old scout!and the last time I worked Mr. Pitcher
for a pass.

Gee, youre a lucky chap, said Dud enviously.

Lucky? Nothing of the sort. Brains, son, brains! Besides, do you call
it lucky to have a long, easy fly go right through your fingers? Huh!
Luck didnt do anything for little Jimmy today! Say, howd the meet
come out? Heard wed won it, but what was the score?

They talked track meeting until the campus was reached and then Dud
returned to the subject of the ball game. They tried Star Meyer in
center for a couple of innings; Parker got his leg spiked and Star
wasnt so bad. Made a pretty catch of a long one that went nearly to
the fence and managed to beat out a bunt in the ninth. I suppose the
first thing I know Ill have to down him as well as Boynton.

Dud looked surprised. Do you think youve got a show, Jimmy? he
inquired.

Why not? asked the other, bristling. Boyntons not much better than
I am. He muffs em, too, now and then. Of course, hes hitting better,
but Ill wager he doesnt get to first any oftener. But if they go and
lug Star into the business, why, thats different. I cant win out
against the whole school!
