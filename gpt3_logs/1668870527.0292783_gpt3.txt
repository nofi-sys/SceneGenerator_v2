SCENE:
XXV

SAVED BY RADIO


Jessie Norwood was not tireless. It seemed to her as though her right
arm would drop off, she pressed the key of the wireless instrument so
frequently. They had written out a brief call of distress, and finally
she got it by heart so that Amy did not have to read her the dots and
dashes.

But it was a slow process and they had no way of learning if the
message was caught and understood by any operator, either ashore or
on board a vessel. Hour after hour went slowly by. The _Marigold_ was
sinking. The pumps could not keep up with the incoming water; the
fuel was almost exhausted and the engines scarcely turned over; the
buffeting seas threatened the craft every minute.

Dr. Stanley remained outwardly cheerful. Darry and the others took
heart from the clergyman's words.

"Tell you what," said Burd. "If we are wrecked on a desert island
I shall be glad to have the doctor along. He'd have cheered up old
Robinson Crusoe."

As the evening waned and the sea continued to pound the hull of the
laboring yacht the older people aboard, at least, grew more anxious.
The young folks in the radio room chattered briskly, although Jessie
called them to account once in a while because they made so much noise
she could not be sure that she was sending correctly.

Darry tried to relieve her at the key, but he confessed that he "made a
mess of it." The radio girls had spent more time and effort in learning
to handle the wireless than the collegians--both Darry and Burd
acknowledged it.

"These are some girls!" Darry said, admiringly.

"You spoil 'em," complained Burd Alling. "Want to be careful what you
say to them."

"Oh, if anybody can stand a little praise it is Jess and I," declared
Amy, sighing with weariness.

Nobody cared to turn in. The situation was too uncertain. The boys
could be with the girls only occasionally, for they had to take their
turn at the pumps. It had come to pass that nothing but steady pumping
kept the yacht from sinking. They were all thankful that the wind
decreased and the waves grew less boisterous.

Towards midnight it was quite calm, only the swells lifted the
water-logged yacht in a rhythmic motion that finally became unpleasant.
Nell was ill, below; but the others remained on deck and managed to
weather the nauseating effects of the heaving sea.

Meanwhile, as often as she could, Jessie Norwood sent out into the air
the cry for assistance. She sent it addressed to "Station Island,"
for she did not know that each wireless station had a code signal--a
combination of letters. But she knew there was but one Station Island
off the coast.

The clapperty-clap, clapperty-clap of the pumps rasped their nerves
at last until, as Amy declared, they needed to scream! When the sound
stopped for the minute while pump-crews were changed, it was a relief.

And finally the spark of the wireless began to skip and fall dead. Good
reason! The storage batteries, although very good ones, were beginning
to fail. Before daybreak it was impossible to use the sender any more.

Somehow this fact was more depressing than anything that had previously
happened. They could only hope, in any event, that their message had
been heard and understood; but now even this sad attempt was halted.

Jessie was really too tired to sleep. She and Amy did not go below for
long. They changed their clothes and came on deck again and were very
glad of the hot cup of coffee Dr. Stanley brought them from the galley.
The cook had been set to work on one of the pump crews.

The girls sat in the deck chairs and stared off across the rolling gray
waters. There was no sign of any other vessel just then, but a dim rose
color at the sea line showed where the sun would come up after a time.

"But a fog is blowing up from the south, too," said Amy. "See that
cloud, Jess? My dear! Did you ever expect that we would be sitting here
on Darry's yacht waiting for it to sink under us?"

"How can you!" exclaimed Jessie, aghast.

"Well, that is practically what we are doing," replied her chum. "Thank
goodness I have had this cup of coffee, anyway. It braces me----"


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The literary style of this scene is fairly straightforward. It is told from a third person point of view, and the tone is one of resignation and fatigue. There is a bit of dialogue, but mostly the scene is a description of the characters' actions and thoughts.
