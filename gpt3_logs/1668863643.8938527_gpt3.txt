SCENE:
Jean leaned forward with a nervous movement of his hands.

He does not appear to have these instincts always, Madame! he said
bluntly. Madame leaned back in her chair and sighed. She gave up the
bronze paper-cutter, as if after all she couldnt do anything with it.

Ah! she said. Youth is so intolerant of appearances. You have not
learned yet, my dear Jean, that appearances are almost always against
the innocent--the others know how to use them! Louis manners are bad,
that I grant you, but he has a good heart. It is for that we love him!
My husband and I have learned its value in Paris. We can trust Louis.

Jean said nothing. If he had said all that he thought, however, it is
improbable that he could have enlightened Madame more plainly than his
silence did.

She gave a little laugh, and he looked up and caught her eyes.

Do you know, Jean? Have you found out yet that there is one very
funny thing about our poor Louis? Perhaps it is even more pathetic
than funny. He has one great--one very great vanity--he believes that
he is superlatively clever, and he would far rather be thought guilty
of a crime than of a mistake. I think that it is the fault of his
having been, as we were saying, badly brought up. Gentlemen are never
afraid of being thought stupid, it is in fact their prerogative--but
when a man doubts his social value, he at once becomes sensitive as to
his intellectual powers; he falls back, as it were, upon a new line
of defence, and he will not admit being mistaken! It is the vanity
of ignorance, the worst type of vanity there is, I fancy, because it
cannot be cured. It may make a man a Napoleon or an _apche_, but there
is one thing, it will never let him be for long--himself! I have seen
Louis, who is naturally the most honest of men, lie and invent scandal
of himself, rather than admit a _btise_ which would have made Torialli
smile. You have, perhaps, come upon this little weakness and it has
shocked you?

Jean started. Was it then after all only stupidity of which Flaubert
was guilty? Madame had known him for a long time. Then he remembered
the deadly terror in Flauberts face and his broken word.

The motive may be as you say, Madame; but there are some things that a
man does not allow himself to do if he wishes to be considered-- Jean
paused.

Yes, Jean, said Madame very gently.

A man of honour, Madame, said Jean.

Madame moved a little restlessly against the green curtain.

Women are so ignorant about such things, she murmured. But, Jean,
when we do not understand we nevertheless sometimes arrive. I have
arrived at this: I believe that Louis has shown himself at his worst
to you. He has made some foolish mistake, and because he respects
and admires you, more than you think perhaps (what he has said in
confidence to me about you I cannot, of course, repeat, but it has
touched me), he has tried to cover up his folly by a falseness which
has disgusted you; and you are judging him harshly because it is one
of your code sins. Have you ever thought that it is not quite fair to
use a gentlemans code for a man who is, perhaps more by the fault of
others than his own, not quite a gentleman?

Jean flushed; he felt ashamed of himself, after all. Hadnt he been
rather hasty? He was touched too, also, to hear of Flauberts feeling
for himself. He had not guessed it; indeed, he had been conscious of a
certain mutual antagonism between himself and the other man--and all
this time Louis had been praising him to Madame!

Well, Madame, he said, smiling a little uncertainly. I will try to
be less intolerant. I cannot promise to like Flaubert, because Im
afraid I dont; but I will try not to show it, and perhaps I shall
understand him better after what you have said.

Thank you, Jean, said Madame. And now I am going to ask more of
you. I want you to write to all these addresses for me, on that nice
new rough paper I bought the other day, and invite everyone to Louis
ball. You see these are all my friends, and he wants the affair to be a
great success; some of these names may help to make it so. I specially
want the two princes to come--Prince Ivan and Prince Rudolph--tell them
La Salvi is going to sing; I must make her, for otherwise perhaps she
would refuse--the good Salvi is a person with whom one must go very
gently. She comes to town to-morrow, I think, and Louis has set his
heart on it; it will be a chance for us to show him that we are his
very good friends.

Jean took the little address book out of her hand. He thought, perhaps,
that he might stoop and kiss it, and that Madame would not be very
angry; she was not very angry. But at this moment a knock came at the
door and the butler announced with immense ceremony, Madame Salvi!


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is formal and polite. Jean is trying to be respectful to Madame, who is clearly a superior. The dialogue is stilted and formal, befitting the setting and the characters' relationship.
