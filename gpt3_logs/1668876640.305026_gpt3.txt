SCENE:
I have a few of the cards with me. The Russian tore up a deck in his
rage at losing. Ill lead the way to the cabin. When I coughyou come.

He followed her forward with his hand gripped upon the butt of the
little silver-plated revolver. The cabins occupied by Harry Raymond and
his cockney tool were upon the deck below the boat deck. Saidee Isaacs
turned at a ladder, grasped the hand-rail, and went down backwardslike
a good sailor.

The deck they both reached was misted and deserted. Four bells had
struck, forward. The lights were out in the saloons. The lookouts and
watch on deck were crouched in the shelter of the ventilators and boats.

Saidee glided swiftly over the planks, stared at a number upon a
cabin-door, then stepped to the next. She knocked with light tapping.
She repeated the signal. She bent her head and listened. Fay braced
himself behind a ladder and waited. He saw her straighten suddenly. The
cabin door was slid open. A man, in pajamas and slippers, thrust his
head out and stared at her.

Get them up! said Fay, springing toward the door. All the way up,
Harry, alias Ace-in-the-hole, alias some other things. I want to see
you! Look out, Saidee.

Fay was the master of the hour. He took no chances. The tiny revolver
was thrust up and under the sharpers chin. The level eyes of the
cracksman snapped dangerously. Blue light seemed to leap from their
depths.

What to hell? stuttered the cardsharper. What does this mean? he
added, forgetting his English drawl.

It means, come clean!

Clean of what?

Those glasses you are wearing! Fay pressed his left hand against the
pink expanse of the sharpers shoulder and shoved him back into the
cabin.

Stand watch! he said to Saidee Isaacs. Let me know if anybody shows
up on the deck.

He sprang inside the cabin and towered over the swindler, who had fallen
back to the bunk in a shivering protest. Fay darted a glance about the
cabin. It was simple enough. A wash-stand was built in the corner. There
was a long, flat trunk under the bunk. Clothes and a cap hung on the
back of a half-stool, half-chair.

Wheres the smoked-glasses? asked Fay. Where did you plant them? I
want them in three seconds, Harry. One!

The sharper moistened his lips and glanced out through the cabin door.
The girl stood there in an attitude of listening. Her face was turned
forward and over the port quarter. Her eyes glowed with suppressed fire.
A shout had sounded from the pilot-house. The wheel had been swung as
much as three degrees. The ship had reeled and then darted on through
the folds of the sea fog.

Fay warily turned and stared at the girl. He stepped toward the door. A
shot, muffled and far to the southward, boomed through the night. It was
repeated with sullen tones. The ship was signaled to stop!

A door opened next to the cabin occupied by Harry Raymond. The cockney
thrust out a long nose and a curious pair of eyes. He stared first out
and over the ships rail. He turned his head and blinked at Saidee
Isaacs. He saw Fays alert form in the doorway. Recognizing him, he
ducked back into his own cabin and drew shut the door.

A fine pal, said the cracksman, brandishing the revolver. You picked
a nice one, Harry. Come clean with the glasses or Ill count two and
then three.

I havent got them, stuttered the sharper. Honest to God, Fay,
theyre in the other cabin. Old Vic has them. I let him keep them after
a game. Y never can tell how people will squeak.

Fay shot a keen glance at the mans face. It was the color of doughand
blue-veined. Fear and weakness had loosened his lips. His teeth showed
under a tawny mustache. His hands clutched the edge of the bunk. His
knees knocked together.

Youre lying! snapped Fay.

Im not, pal. I wouldnt lie to you. Cocky has the glasses.

Whats the trick? How do you read the cards with them?

The sharper hesitated. He was on the point of speaking when a third shot
echoed through the fog. A solid projectile screeched over the white
boats on the hurricane-deck of the ship. A shudder passed from stem to
stern. The great vessel had reversed its propeller. Saidee leaned aft
and Fay was thrown against the side of the cabin. Shouting and the
hoarse orders of the mates resounded. The fog was ripped in one place to
port. Through the gap the fine prow and the belching funnels of a
British destroyer of the superclass leaped. She bore down and rounded
the ships bow like a skater on ice. Four flags were flung to her bridge
signal-halliards. A callow lieutenant-commander in oil-skins and a
souwester held a battered speaking-trumpet to his beardless lips.
Beside him stood a man in a plaid overcoat and cap.
