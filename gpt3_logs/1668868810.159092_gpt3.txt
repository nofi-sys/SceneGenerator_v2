Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Certainly, he said, I will read it aloud: only I must warn you, that
its contents are not such as are usual, I will not say in a
proclamation, but in print of any kind. To begin with, it is, I must
warn you, from first to last a print of the last blasphemy of madness.

The listeners did not answer this, but looked and felt uncomfortable.

Will you not read, then? Donna Emilia said at last. Don Inocencio
began to read aloud. He bent a little over the paper, so that he might
read; he beat time with his left hand, in a pumping stroke, to mark his
cadence. He began as follows:

This, he said, is his preludium or exordium.

PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

Forasmuch as I, Don Lopez de Meruel, King, Emperor and Dictator
of Santa Barbara, am convinced of my divinity and of my oneness
with God. Know all men, that henceforth, throughout this my
heaven of Santa Barbara, I assume the style and name of God,
with the titles of Thrice Holy, Thrice Blessed, Thrice Glorious.

What do you make of that? he said, for a beginning?

The man is mad, Rosa said.

It is blasphemy unspeakable, Donna Emilia said. I tremble lest fire
descend on us.

This is nothing to what follows, Don Inocencio said. I will read on.
The rest is incredibly much worse. But the rest, I, for one, rejoice at.
It continues thus:

I therefore, thy God, decree, that henceforth my mortals worship
and sacrifice to me in all churches, chapels and places of
worship whatsoever; that all prayer, praise, worship and
adoration, with all hymns, psalms and spiritual ejaculations of
whatever kind, be henceforth addressed to me, whether in public
or in private, I, thy God Lopez, decree it.

Likewise thy God decrees (and in reading this, Donna Emilia, I
ask pardon of my Maker) thy God decrees, that all other Gods,
saints and suchlike, hitherto worshipped in this my Heaven, such
as (here he writes in a way that cannot be quoted) shall be cast
aside, their images defaced, their altars denied and their
rituals omitted, upon pain of death.

Furthermore, thy God decrees that my image be placed in all
churches and in all chapels of churches, wheresoever there be an
altar; and that instead of the services hitherto used at such
places, a service to me only shall be used, with the title the
Red Mass to God Lopez, the Thrice Holy.

And thy God decrees, that at the mention of thy God, at His
passing, at His coming, upon His feast days, as at the passing
of His priests and in the presence of His decrees, all My
people, without exception, shall cry, Blessed be God Lopez, and
shall sign the mark of thy God, a circle and a dot, upon breast
and head.

Lopez, Thrice Glorious, Thrice Blessed, Thrice Holy.

All who infringe This My Decree, in Thought or Word or Deed,
shall suffer Death.

From My Heaven in Plaza Verde,

   LOPEZ  GOD  LOPEZ.   

That, Don Inocencio said, is our rulers proclamation in this year of
grace. What do you think of it?

Rosa went to the paper to read some printing at the foot.

It is genuine, she said. It is printed at the palace press.

I believe it to be genuine, Don Inocencio said.

Donna Emilia crossed herself for the third time: she spoke with some
difficulty.

Did you say, Inocencio, that you rejoice at this proclamation?

I do, he said, sincerely, Emilia, I do. We have been for far too long
apathetic: now this outrage will rouse us from sleep: it may be our
salvation as a nation. We ourselves are in some measure responsible for
this madness. We have connived at madness in the palace too long: he
takes advantage of our supineness to seize us by the throats. Now there
can be but one answer.
