SCENE:
VI
AN EXODUS AND A BATTLE

Orthis, who was becoming the almost constant companion of the chief, was
standing beside the latter, while I was twenty-five or thirty yards
away, and directly between Ga-va-go and the warriors who were
approaching with the prisoner, who would of necessity have to pass close
beside me. I remained where I was, therefore, in order to get a better
look at it, which was rather difficult because it was almost entirely
surrounded by No-vans. However as they came opposite me, there was a
little break momentarily in the ranks, and I had my first opportunity,
though brief, for a closer observation of the captive; and my
comprehension was almost staggered by what my eyes revealed to me, for
there before me, was as perfectly formed a human female as I had ever
seen. By earthly standards, she appeared a girl of about eighteen, with
hair of glossy blackness, that suggested more the ravens wing than
aught else and a skin of almost marble whiteness, slightly tinged with a
creamy shade. Only in the color of her skin, did she differ from earthly
women in appearance, except that she seemed far more beautiful than
they. Such perfection of features seemed almost unbelievable. Had I seen
her first posed motionless, I could have sworn that she was chiseled
from marble, yet there was nothing cold about her appearance. She fairly
radiated life and feeling. If my first impression had been startling, it
was nothing to the effect that was produced when she turned her eyes
full upon me. Her black brows were two thin, penciled arches, beneath
which were dark wells of light, vying in blackness with her raven hair.
On either cheek was just the faintest suggestion of a deeper cream, and
to think that these hideous creatures saw in that form divine only flesh
to eat! I shuddered at the thought and then my eyes met hers and I saw
an expression of incredulity and surprise registered in those liquid
orbs. She half-turned her head as she was dragged past, that she might
have a further look at me, for doubtless she was as surprised to see a
creature like me as I was to see her.

Involuntarily I started forward. Whether there was an appeal for succor
in those eyes I do not know, but at least they aroused within me
instantly, that natural instinct of a human male to protect the weak.
And so it was that I was a little behind her and to her right, when she
was halted before Ga-va-go.

The savage Va-gas chieftain eyed her coldly, while from all sides there
arose cries of Give us flesh! Give us flesh! We are hungry! to which
Ga-va-go paid not the slightest attention.

From whence come you, U-ga? he demanded.

Her head was high, and she eyed him with cold dignity as she replied,
From Laythe.

The No-van raised his brows. Ah, he breathed, from Laythe. The flesh
of the women from Laythe is good, and he licked his thin lips.

The girl narrowed her eyes, and tilted her chin a bit higher. Rympth!
she ejaculated, disgustedly.

As rympth is the name of the four-legged snake of Va-nah, the inner
lunar world, and considered the lowest and most disgusting of created
things, she could not well have applied a more opprobrious epithet to
the No-van chieftain, but if it had been her intent to affront him, his
expression gave no indication that she had succeeded.

Your name? he asked.

Nah-ee-lah, she replied.

Nah-ee-lah, he repeated, Ah, you are the daughter of Sagroth, Jemadar
of Laythe.

She nodded in indifferent affirmation, as though aught he might say was
a matter of perfect indifference to her.

What do you expect us to do with you? asked Ga-va-go, a question which
suggested a cat playing with a mouse before destroying it.

What can I expect of the Va-gas, other than that they will kill me and
eat me? she replied.

A roar of savage assent arose from the creatures surrounding her.
Ga-va-go flashed a quick look of anger and displeasure at his people.

Do not be too sure of that, he snapped. This be little more than a
meal for Ga-va-go alone. It would but whet the appetite of the tribe.

There are two more, suggested a bold warrior, close beside me,
pointing at me and at Orthis.

Silence! roared Ga-va-go. Since when did you become chief of the
No-vans?

We can starve without a chief, muttered the warrior who had spoken,
and from two or three about him arose grumblings of assent.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the character of the captive, Nah-ee-lah, and to establish the conflict between her and the Va-gas chieftain, Ga-va-go. The author also uses this scene to establish the No-vans' hunger and their desire for flesh.
