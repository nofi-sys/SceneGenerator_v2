SCENE:
But indeed it is true about Louis, she went on. He is rising in the
world, he has become very ambitious; you will never guess to what he
aspires now?

My dear, I have always guessed it, said Salvi calmly. It is you who
never see these things; it was inevitable that he should adore you----

Madame Torialli laughed lightly.

It is another inevitable avoided then, she answered. He has not
confided his passion to me--for myself, dear friend; on the contrary
he aspires very much higher--it appears that he wants you to sing for
him on the great night itself. When you are going to sing for us on the
following Wednesday, too, it is a little too ambitious, is it not?

Madame Salvi frowned.

I am not surprised to hear that he gets on, she said. If he is so
little afraid of being snubbed.

It is amusing, is it not? said Madame Torialli. He is not like poor
Torialli, who always says that he will never let business interfere
with pleasure.

Well, my dear, he has no need to, since he has married you, said
Salvi.

You are too kind to me, Madame Torialli murmured; but think of our
poor Louis, so certain that you would agree to sing for him that he has
sent out invitations already to Prince Ivan and Prince Rudolph, asking
them to hear you.

Jean started. He had written all the invitations and Flaubert had given
no such order; it was Madame herself who had invited the princes to
hear Salvi.

_Mon Dieu!_ cried Salvi indignantly. Do you know, Gabrielle, I am a
good-natured woman, but there is one liberty I do not stand lightly,
and that is a liberty about my voice.

Oh, my dear! cried Madame Torialli, dont be too angry with the good
Louis; his head is perhaps a little turned with his new toy, but he
has, I know, such an eagerness to have you.

His head had better be turned round the other way, then, said Salvi,
grimly. And as for his eagerness, as far as I know, that is no new
quality in people who ask favours. You may tell him from me that I
shall do nothing of the kind! You have reminded me that I sing for you
on Wednesday. I shall not sing twice in one week.

Our poor Louis will be horribly desolated, said Madame cheerfully;
but of course you are right. However, my dear, dont refuse to come to
the ball; that will be magnificent and quite amusing.

No, I will come to the ball, said Salvi. And I shant tell him that
I wont sing till I get there; that will pay him out!

Madame Torialli laughed her gay childs laughter.

But what a mind you have! she said. It would be enough even without
your voice, dear Salvi.

I flatter myself that I was not born a fool, said Madame Salvi,
complacently; and it is true that she flattered herself.

What has become of the new little _accompagnateur_? Has he too fallen
in love with you like the last? she said.

Jean moved hastily. There was a sudden pause between the two ladies.
Madame Torialli realized that Jean had overheard the conversation; she
did not change a muscle of her face.

But he is writing letters for me in the next room, she said. You
must ask him yourself, my dear; Monsieur Jean? she added.

Jean came into the room; he could not hide his feelings as well as
Madame Torialli. His eyes were full of pain and bewilderment.

I think you have already met Madame Salvi? said Gabrielle quietly.

Jean bowed very low.

Madame Salvi chuckled till she shook again like a vast crumpled jelly
fish.

You came in first, or I was going to be very indiscreet, she said.
If you had been a wise young man you would have waited and profited by
the indiscretion.

Madame is too kind, murmured Jean. He wanted immensely to get away.
Madame Torialli held him for a moment with her eyes.
