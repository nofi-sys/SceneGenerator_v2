SCENE:
XVII

THE HOLDING OF THE PASS

He was very different to the gallant figure of Inverness and
Edinburgh days.  Weeks of wandering in the wildest Highland country
had brought out his finest, most admirable qualities.  Hardship, that
strange test of man, had made him far dearer and more romantic than
he had ever been before.  There was no jealousy of Irish favourites
now--no dread of English influence when St. James's should be
reached--all that was gone never to return.  There was instead a
Prince in a tattered kilt, and a dirty shirt, bare-footed and with a
gun in his hand, a pistol and dirk by his side--a man just like
themselves and thrown by the harshness of destiny upon their loyalty
and succour.

Here was a Prince indeed, one who could march and shoot and have a
merry word at the end of the day.  Had they known what was in him a
year before, who can say but the Highlands would have risen to a man.

To Rob he was wonderful, just because he was human and in distress.
Even to Muckle John, strange medley of contradictions as he was,
there was present in the harassed figure in the opening to the cave
an emotional appeal like the lilt of an old song.  Some day he knew
he would compose a melody for his beloved chanter.  The very notion
of it brought a lump to his throat.

Meanwhile the Prince had looked them all over with his keen frank
eyes.

"Gentlemen," he said in an utterly exhausted voice, "I crave your
pardon for interrupting your sport; but I am, as you see, a fugitive
and hard pressed.  It is good to come upon you, Dr. Cameron, so
unexpectedly, for I have sore need of your guidance at this time."

Then, turning to Muckle John, he looked him up and down.

"I seem to remember your face, sir," he said.  "If this is your
country, may I claim the rights of Highland hospitality?"

"Your Highness..." broke out Cameron.  But he shook his head at him.

"No Prince to-day," he said, "but only a hunted man, with more
thought for his next meal than the Crown of England itself."

With a start Muckle John came forward and knelt at his feet.

"Your Highness," said he, "I hold this country by right of my
claymore, and the guns of these men of mine; what my name is, is
neither here nor there, and what my manner of life is ye can maybe
guess, and why these two gentlemen are here ye will learn from their
ain lips.  But it will never be said I took advantage of any man's
distress, least of all the sad plight of your Royal Highness."

Cameron, who had been fidgeting during these remarks, broke in
hurriedly with a very red face.

"I cannot imagine to what you refer, sir," he said, eyeing Muckle
John.  "No one has anything to learn from Rob and me regarding one
who is as true to the Prince as you, sir."

"Sir," returned Muckle John bowing to him gravely, "you will not find
me forgetful of such words."

Before any one could say further the Prince interrupted them, and
thanked Muckle John in a broken voice.  Then, taking Cameron aside,
he asked him how soon they could win their way to Badenoch, where he
was to meet Cluny Macpherson, and to hear news of the French ships.

Cameron was about to reply, when a shout from somewhere down the glen
made them both halt and look towards the watchful figure of Muckle
John.

Something seemed to have turned his body to stone.  Rob, who was
nearest to him, stepped quickly to the spy-hole commanding the
valley, and stared down the rocky slope.

For a moment he detected nothing; then, with a gasp of horror, he
observed tiny blots of red running like ants among the rocks, coming
ever nearer--red-coats following upon the trail.

A hand touched him upon the shoulder.

"Not a word of this to the Prince," whispered Muckle John, "but do as
I bid."  And he led him a little away.

"Now, Rob," he said, "let what happened in the past have the go-by,
and dinna think ower hardly of Muckle John.  I liked ye fine, Rob,
and when you wrote that letter from the fort I could have cried at
the daft spirit of it.  Well, Rob, there's the English, and here are
we; and some one must hold this pass if the Prince is to win through."
