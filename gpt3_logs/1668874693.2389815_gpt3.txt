What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
But it was about you. It was because they wouldnt tell me where you
were, and wouldnt let me see you home.

That doesnt make any difference.

This answer was a blow. Miss Lane was the first woman who had ever
excited in him any but the most fleeting admiration. He looked upon
women as a nuisance in the hunting-field and a positive danger at a
_battue_, pretty things whose society at any sort of gathering gave
one more trouble than it was worth, and who ought accordingly to feel
deeply grateful for any admiration that might be cast to them. Of
course this applied only to his equals; with women of a lower rank
he was at his ease; and it was a current prophecy that he would be a
bachelor till he was forty-five, and then marry his cook. So he looked
down at Miss Lane in amazement without speaking, when she thus candidly
stated that his admiration didnt make any difference.

Then you hate me, I see, said he, at last, deeply hurt and offended.

Hate you? No; indeed I dont, Mr. Braithwaite! she answered, rising.

It had only just dawned upon her that his unusually restless manner
and his flushed face were the result of anything but his natural
awkwardness, and she was anxious to cut the interview short, for fear
any of the Mainwarings should pass--they would perhaps not even believe
she had met him by accident.

Then why do you want to run away from me? I may be a brute; but I
wont hurt you.

Oh, no; I am not afraid of that! said she, her face breaking into the
bright, child-like smile that made her so charming to him. But it is
really time for me to go in.

She held out her hand; but he did not seem to see it. He was positively
shaking with nervousness, preparing for a bold stroke.

Wont you shake hands, or have I offended you too deeply? she asked,
with simple, smiling coquetry.

Harry jerked his head suddenly down to her upturned face, and kissed
her. George, who was observing this scene, watched for the girls
start, listened for the scream.

But there was neither. She remained quite still, without a sound but a
short, quick sob that George was too far off to hear, and he could only
see that she bent her head, without being able to catch the expression
of her face. He watched a moment longer, then, with a curious look of
cynical surprise, turned and sauntered back to the Grange.

But Harry was near enough to know better. He saw the color leave her
cheeks and her very lips, and he knew that his impertinence had made
her dumb and still with horror. Then the tears began to gather in her
eyes; she stooped to feel blindly for the book she had dropped, then
turned her back upon him without a word.

In a moment he was mad with remorse.

Miss Lane! said he huskily; but she took no notice, and began to walk
away.

All his better instincts were aroused, and moved him to words less
boorish than usual.

Miss Lane, he repeated, I would give my right hand to undo my
impertinence or to make you forget it! Upon my soul, you cannot hate me
for it as much as I hate myself! Wont you--wont you just look at me?
Only just let me see you look again as you looked before--even if you
dont speak. Good heavens, you look like stone!

But she shook her head without looking up.

Go away, please, was all she said, in a voice from which the bright
ring had gone.

Harry was sobbing himself.

You--you are more cruel than I, said he, unsteadily.

But he dared not stay. Those few words of dismissal were too cutting
for him to try any more entreaties. He scrambled through the hedge,
rather anxious that she should see he was hurting himself in his
eagerness to obey her. But she never looked round. She made her way
back to her cottage more quietly, without even shedding any more tears.
She was too much excited for that. But, when she was once more in
her little sitting-room, she gave way, threw herself on the floor by
the sofa, and cried until she could scarcely see. She was so proud,
so haughtily reserved to men, that this outrage to her dignity and
self-respect wounded her far more deeply than it would have done an
ordinary girl.
