What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
A very sound maxim, quoth he. And inwardly he found himself
ejaculating, What an adorable voice, what an altogether flexible,
musical and charming voice.

Rosamund was looking down the heather-covered slope. At the further
side, a quarter of a mile or so away, was a hedge, and in the hedge a
gate. Beyond the gate was a lane, which, after a series of turns, would
lead one eventually to the village and Delancey Castle. This latter, it
is perhaps somewhat obvious to remark, was her goal, and the way across
the heather towards the gate by far the nearest route to it. Yet how
attempt that route with the black and white goat still at large adown
the hill, eating sprays of heather--or what appeared to be sprays of
heather--in a deceitfully placid and amicable manner?

I wonder if that goat-- she began, her eyes vaguely troubled, her
brow slightly puckered.

Which way do you want to go? demanded John promptly, the promptitude
mingled with a nice degree of deferential courtesy,--the courtesy quite
apparent, the deference a tiny subtle flavour.

To that gate. She indicated it.

Then, said John, please allow me to accompany you. I think Antony
and I between us will prove a match for goats. I dare to boast on our
behalf, since we have already proved our prowess in the matter.

He threw Antony a glance, a little friendly, understanding glance. By
such glances are bonds established that will last a lifetime.

Me too, quoth Michael, breaking silence for the first time.

In very sooth, you too, said John. Antony as advance guard,--not
more than a couple of paces advance, mind you,--Michael and I on
either side. Are we ready? Then, quick march.

This last was mere pandering to accepted custom. You cannot well say,
Slow march, though it is what your whole soul intends. Here is a fine
illustration of the fact that speech is but a poor mode of expressing a
mans thoughts. And then an inspiration came to him.

Not too quickly, said he to the advance guard. If he thinks we
are attempting to elude him, he may pursue us. A nonchalant, a mere
careless strolling, will be our wisest course.

Oh, do you think he might follow? cried Rosamund. The suggestion had
evidently given cause for renewed anxiety.

It is possible, returned John gravely, though, I fancy, not
probable. However, we will take no risks.

Slowly, therefore, in mere dilatory fashion, they set forth. The goat
raised his read to look at them; but, having his orders, he dropped it
again towards the heather.

Some hundred yards or so they walked in silence, two, at least, of the
party casting occasional furtive glances to the right. John was the
first to speak.

This, he said, with the air of a man who has just made a discovery,
is really beautiful country.

It is your first visit to this neighbourhood? queried Rosamund.

My first, returned John, but I dare swear it will not be my last. My
friend, Corin Elmore, dragged me down here, somewhat against my will
at the outset, Ill allow. Hes uncovering the mural paintings in the
church down yonder.

Ah! Rosamund turned towards him, a light of interest in her eyes.
Has he found much?

He only started on the job this morning, returned John. We arrived
last night. But hes full of confidence. There must be a curious
fascination in the work,--delving into the past, bringing traces of
bygone, forgotten ages into the light of day.

And a certain sadness, she suggested.

And a certain sadness, echoed John, though I doubt me if Corin
experiences it greatly. Hes an anomaly. For all that hes a poet and a
bit of a dreamer, theres a strain of the scientific dissector running
through him. It finds its outlet in theosophic tendencies. John pulled
a wry face.

He had forgotten that he was talking to an absolute stranger. Yet was
she a stranger in the true sense of the word? One afternoon--six months
ago as we crudely count and label time, though to John it was centuries
ago--he had had sight of her, a mere passing glimpse, truly, since it
was of length only sufficient to allow of her mounting the steps of the
Brompton Oratory, at a moment when John was about to descend them. He
had put a question to a friend who was with him. And thenceforth Johns
dreams had been coloured--I might almost say suffused--by one subject,
a face with dark eyes, framed in copper-coloured hair, and shadowed by
a largish black hat. Being, therefore, no stranger to his dreams in
spirit, it was small wonder that he regarded her as no stranger to his
perceptions in the flesh.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:
