Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Just as they emerged from the Westabrook estate into South Satuit,
Maidas bicycle made a sudden swerve. Why I just saw Silva Burle! she
called in a whisper to Rosie. She was walking along the trail towards
the Little House. I wonder what she is doing there?

Well you may be very sure she isnt calling on _us_, Rosie declared,
and if she is Im delighted to think that Granny will say, Not at
home!

Still, Maida said thoughtfully, that trail leads directly to the
Little House. She must be going there for some reason.

Probably, Laura remarked scornfully, shes hoping shell meet some
of us, sos she can make faces at us.

The automobile arrived at the beach first and the cyclists came
straggling in one after another. Crescent Moon Beach was like a deeply
cut silver crescent, furred at each tip of the crescent with a tight
grove of scrub-pines which grew down to the very waters edge. Beyond
it, except for a single island, stretched unbroken the vast heaving
blue of the Atlantic. Under the lee of the southern tip of the crescent
was a line of half-a-dozen bath houses.

What a wonderful, wonderful beach! Laura commented.

And theres that island, Dicky said, that we see from the Tree
House--Spectacles Island, didnt you say--oh no, I remember, Tom
Tiddlers Ground. How I wish I could swim out to it. I have never been
on an island in my life. Could you swim as far as that, Arthur?

Arthur laughed. I should say not. Nobody but a professional could do
that--and perhaps hed find it some pull. Its much longer than it
looks, Dicky. Distances on the water are very deceiving.

Whats on the Island, Maida? Dicky went on curiously. Have you ever
been there?

Oh yes, Maida answered, once. I went on fathers yacht but I was
such a little little girl that I have only one impression--of great
trees and enormous rocks and thick underbrush.

Dicky sighed. I wish we could go on a picnic there!

Whats that over there? Harold demanded, pointing to a spot far out
where a series of poles, connected by webs of fish-net, rose above the
waters surface.

Oh thats a fish weir, Maida declared electrically. Id forgotten
all about that. You see the tides going out. It goes out almost two
miles here. And if we follow it up, we can get into the weir and come
back before the tide overtakes us.

Maida explained the situation to Floribel. Floribel turned to Zeke for
advice. Zeke corroborated Maidas story. He had, he said, been in that
weir several times himself. Floribel said she would stay on the beach
with the Little Six while Zeke accompanied the Big Six. When they came
back, she added, lunch would be all spread out on the beach.

The last bath house, Maida informed them, is ours. Now lets get
into our bathing suits at once because we have no time to lose.

It was only partially low tide when they arrived but it almost seemed
to the children that they could see the water slipping away towards the
horizon. When they emerged from the bath house, a patch of eelgrass,
not far off, made a brilliant green spot in the midst of the golden
sand. As the Big Six started towards the fish weir, the Little Six were
splashing about in the warm shallows near shore.

Oh what fun this is! Rosie said. I love salt-water bathing more than
fresh water--I dont know why. But somehow I always feel so much gayer.

The salt water seemed to have an effect of gayety on all of them.
They chattered incessantly when they were not laughing or singing.
At times they came to hollows between the sand bars where the water
was waist-high, but in the main, the water came no farther than their
knees; and it continued to recede steadily before them. Sand-bar after
sand-bar bared itself to the light of the sun--stretched before them
in ridges of solid gold. Eelgrass--patch after patch--lifted above
the water; spread around them areas of brilliant green. Above, white
clouds and blue ether wove a radiant sky-ceiling. And between, the
gulls swooped and soared, circled and dashed, emitting their strange,
creaking cries. It seemed an hour at least to the Big Six before they
reached the weir, but in fact it had taken little more than half that
time.

Zeke found the entrance to the weir and they followed him in. Here the
water was waist-deep. Zeke explained the plan of the weir. It was, he
pointed out, nothing but a deep-sea trap for fish. The fish entered
through the narrow opening into a channel which led into the big
inner maze. Although it was very easy for them to float in, it was a
very difficult matter finding the way out. Caught there, as the tide
retreated, they stayed until the fisherman arrived with his cart and
shoveled them ignominiously into it.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with Maida and Rosie on their bicycles, just as they emerge from the Westabrook estate. Maida sees Silva Burle walking along the trail towards the Little House and wonders what she is doing there. Rosie is sure that Silva is not calling on them and is glad that their grandmother will say "not at home."
The scene shifts to Crescent Moon Beach, where the group of children has arrived. They comment on the beauty of the beach and the island in the distance. Maida tells them that she has been to the island before and it is full of trees, rocks, and underbrush. Dicky wishes they could go on a picnic there.
The children notice a series of poles in the distance, connected by fish-nets, and Maida explains that it is a fish weir. She tells them that the tide is going out and they have a limited amount of time to explore the weir before the tide comes back in. Floribel decides to stay on the beach with the Little Six while Zeke accompanies the Big Six.
The group gets into their bathing suits and starts towards the weir. They splash around in the water, chatting and laughing. They reach the weir and Zeke shows them the entrance. He explains that it is a deep-sea trap for fish and that the fish enter through the narrow opening into a channel which leads into the big inner maze. The fish are caught there as the tide retreats and stay there until the fisherman arrives with his cart to shovel them into it.
