SCENE:
XII.


Gerald Gibson had not gone many yards further down the street, after
seeing the meeting between Miss Langton and Colonel Richardson, when he
was overtaken by a fellow-actor, Aubrey Cooke.

Did you see who little Langton was talking to?

Some friend of hers, I suppose. I didnt notice.

It was Frank Richardson, the man there was all that scandal about a
few years ago--Lord Berwicks wife--dont you remember?

Well?

Well, Im sorry he has got hold of little Langton, that is all.

You are sorry without cause, then. Miss Langton is a long way above
his level. She cant refuse to speak to him, for he knew her people
well years ago.

With unerring certainty Gerald Gibson had jumped to this conclusion.
The other looked surprised.

Oh, you know all about it, then? You are the favorite one for whom
Miss Prim opens her lips. Well, I really am glad to hear it, for she
is the flag I always hold out when old ladies tell me there are no
virtuous women on the stage; and, if she were to go I dont know where
on earth I should look for another.

You are too cynical, Cooke.

Dont shy long words at me. If I deserve them it is because I was
led away to a meeting of the Society for the Mutual Improvement
of the Clerical and Dramatic Professions this afternoon. Capital
institution--the parsons looked happy and the pro.s looked good. But
that cant last. Good-night.

Aubrey Cooke was not at his best with Gibson; the two men had too
little in common. But he was a clever fellow. He had a plain, silly
face, a bitter tongue, and a manner which found favor with most women.
He adored women. Those, however, he worshiped the most deferentially
would scarcely have approved of the manner in which he spoke of them
among other men in their absence, for there was a strong dash of young
Paris in his adoration. He was too shrewd to make many mistakes; and no
man knew better the exact tone in which to address any particular woman
of his large and varied acquaintance. He bore Miss Langton no ill-will
for repeated unmerited snubs; the caprices of women are infinite,
prettier and less prim women abounded, and he could revenge himself
so easily by an epigram--not a slanderous one, but none the less
cutting--in the dressing-room.

When Annie first recognized Colonel Richardson as he crossed the road
toward her, her impulse was to walk on; but anxiety to hear something
about the family at the Elms changed her intention, and she stopped,
shook hands with him, and allowed him to walk down the street with her.

I knew you the moment you came on, said he. It was a happy thought
to go on the stage; I admire your courage.

I dont think it was courage that sent me on; and at present I have
had no reason to congratulate myself on my attempt, I assure you. Did
Mrs. Falconer know me?

No. She did not care for the piece, and was not paying much attention
to it. She does not know you are on the stage, for she told me she
thought you had become a governess somewhere. You have done better than
that.

Yes. And the rest of the Braithwaites? Have you seen any of them since
your return?

No; but Mrs. Falconer gives a very bad account of some of them.

What does she say? Tell me quickly, please.

It seems there have been quarrels among the brothers lately,
about money matters, I believe. Sir George and Harry are the chief
disputants, and Mrs. Falconer never knows what the next news about them
may be. But I am paining you----

No, no; I want to hear everything. Will you tell me all you know about
my husband? Is he well? Is he no steadier?

I believe he is well now; but he was ill some months ago.

Ill. What was the matter with him?

Colonel Richardson hesitated.
