SCENE:
Yes. Stephen is coming up this morning to see me, with statements from
George--not very cheerful ones, I fancy. But dont trouble your head
about that, darling, or you will be unfit for to-night. We shall pull
through right enough, never fear!

Why, I am not nearly so anxious as you are, Harry! I shall get my
salary next week--six guineas--and then, if we only live a little more
economically, we shall get on splendidly.

Yes, yes; it will be all right. There is the hansom outside. I must
send you alone this morning, my darling, for I must stay at home to see
Stephen when he comes. Good-bye--good luck to you, Annie.

He put her carefully into the hansom, giving her hand a tender
lover-like little squeeze as he helped her in, and went back into the
hotel for his cigar-case, to pass away the time with a cigar as he
walked up and down outside, waiting for his cousin.

When she returned from rehearsal, in a hansom by Harrys orders, she
found Stephen waiting outside the hotel to receive her. He was looking
pale and anxious, and she asked him hurriedly what was the matter.

Come in and Ill tell you, said he.

He led her into the coffee-room, which was empty.

You have bad news, Stephen, I am sure! What is it? Where is Harry?

He told me to break it to you. He has quite given way under it. You
will try not to be very much shocked, wont you? It is about George.
He----

Not dead? whispered she, white to the lips.

Oh, no; he is quite well! But he has smashed up.

Poor fellow! said she sympathizingly, but much relieved. Is he
really quite ruined?

Yes, I am afraid so; he has been in difficulties for a long time now,
you know. The Grange will have to be sold, of course; but it and the
land are so heavily mortgaged that that wont relieve him much. He has
expected the crash for a long time, and Wilfred and I had some notion
of it too; but Harry never dreamed of such a thing, and it has knocked
him over altogether.

But why does he take it so much to heart? He will be better off than
anybody now Ive got such a good engagement.

It seems he wanted to persuade you to give up acting and go and live
with him at the Grange; he told William and me so just now.

William!

Yes: I brought him up with me, and he is with Harry now, unless Harry
has turned him out of the room; for, when your husband said you were
growing fond of him, William said that was nonsense, and I had a lot of
trouble in getting them to leave each other alone.

But it is true, and it was very wrong of William to contradict him.
He has been very kind to me, and I am quite glad that at last I can do
something for him.

Frankly, Annie, I dont think hell let you. He is very obstinate,
you know, when once he gets an idea into his head; and he has taken to
thinking that it would be beneath his dignity to live on your earnings.
And really, you know, I think he is right.

But how is he to live any other way?

I dont know, I am sure; I think that is what is bothering him, and
the thought that he will have to leave you.

But he mustnt do that.

Then you had better go and tell him so; he has been crying about that.
He says, just as you were beginning to like him, all his work is undone
again, and you will call him a loafer.

I will go to him, said Annie; and she left Stephen, and went
up-stairs to her sitting-room, where William rushed at her directly she
opened the door.

She saw that Harry was lying on the sofa, with his face in the
cushions; but she could not get at him at once, for the child was
dancing round her, glancing at Harry and crossing his fingers with an
expressive grimace, to intimate that his brother was in a bad temper
and had better be left to the solitary enjoyment of it.

He will only snap at you, whispered he, as Annie pushed past him
gently and went toward the sofa; and William, with his soft whistle,
went out of the room.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is fairly straightforward and simple. There is a bit of dialogue, but mostly it is a description of what is happening. The tone is somewhat anxious and tense, as the characters are discussing some bad news. The point of view is third person limited, as we only know what the characters are thinking and feeling.
