SCENE:
You go the other way, Pop directed in a low voice to Bug Eye.
Ill follow Teddy--I dont like the way hes talkin. Roy may be
pretty badly hurt after all, an Teddy feels it. I seen Roy go
head-on to that rock, but I wouldnt tell Ted that. Well meet you
at camp. If you find Roy, give a good loud yell--that is, if
hes--not hurt too bad. And Pop swallowed quickly. Then he turned
and followed Teddy.

The boy was a good distance ahead, and Pop had to hurry to catch
him. He located him by the crashing of the bushes as Teddy ran
along, almost blindly, calling Roy every five yards.

Son, son, the veteran puncher admonished, laying a hand on Teddys
shoulder, dont take it so hard. Well find Roy, sure as shootin!
Yuh cant down him with a little spill in the river! Like as not
hes laughin over it now an bettin he could have made the shore
with the one paddle if we hadnt hit that rock. Shake yore stumps,
Teddy, an get a hold on yore liver. Roy aint hurt!

Teddy took a deep breath and slowed down to a walk.

Cant tell, Pop, he declared gloomily. Im afraid of--I dont
know what. Why didnt Roy come right ashore if he could?

But great snakes, boy, he may be on the other side, or he may have
been washed far downstream! Pop exploded. Just because he aint
here, dont say hes still sittin out there on that bloomin rock!

Thats right, too! Teddy agreed, and brightened. Ill bet hes
across from us! If we only had that canoe now, we could--

Oh, no we couldnt, Pop interrupted grimly. That current is too
blame strong. I reckon we can find the canoe all right, come
mornin. Shell probably need patchin, but I can fix her if she
aint too bad.

It was just this sort of talk that Teddy needed, and when he spoke
again his voice was stronger and more spirited.

Do you really think we can mend the canoe, Pop?

Sure we can! Wont be nothin to it. Now, Teddy, we better give up
lookin for Roy until she gets light. Were only wastin time this
way, an I got an idea hes over on the other bank. If thats so, we
got to find the boat first an go get him. Lets hit for camp,
Teddy.

For a moment the boy hesitated, and Pop feared he was going to
insist on continuing. But at last the boy sighed, and turned.

Youre the doctor, he said dully. Camp it is.

Had Teddy known the real reason for Pops insistence upon returning,
he would have slept little that night. The fact is that the veteran
rancher feared the worst. He had seen Roy dashed head foremost upon
the rock, then go limp. At that moment the moon was blotted out, and
he lost sight of the boy. But he had seen enough to feel that there
was little hope for Roy.

There had never been for a moment the question of rescue. It had all
happened too quickly--the rock, then the crash, and then that
horrible drop. They had been swept apart in a flash, and were not
near enough to offer each other assistance. Pop knew that ordinarily
Roy would have made the shore safely. But injured, perhaps
unconscious--The old man shook his head sadly and was thankful for
the darkness that hid the tragedy even for a little.

Their fire was still going well when they reached camp, and half
heartedly they set about drying themselves. None of them talked
much. Their hearts were too heavy. Pop made an effort at
conversation, but did not meet with much success, and at last
decided that it would be best to leave Teddy alone with his
thoughts. Perhaps the boy might find inward comfort as the night
wore on. Pop hoped so, fervently.

The hours passed slowly, as none of the three even attempted to
sleep.

As soon as the gray dawn lightened into brightness, Teddy sprang to
his feet.

Now, he said sharply, we can start. We wont stop-- his eyes
narrowed and he clenched his fists. Well find Roy if we have to
stay here a week! Come on!

No breakfast, son? Pop expostulated questioningly, thinking that
unless Teddy kept up his strength he might collapse when he learned
the truth. For Pop was firmly convinced that they would see Roy
alive no more. Yet, even with this weight on his heart, he presented
to Teddy a face that had nothing in it but hope.
