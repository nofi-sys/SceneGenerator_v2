SCENE:
The Secretary of State leaned back in his chair and studied the young
man before him. Sit down, Mr. Topham, he said at last.

Topham sat down. He was a good-looking young fellow, soldierly and
straight as a ramrod, but without the stiffness that usually goes
with a military carriage. His tanned face and, in fact, his whole
bearing spoke of an out-door life--probably a life on the sea. Such an
occupation was also indicated by his taciturnity, for he said nothing,
though the secretary waited long, as if to give him a chance to speak.

Finally the secretary seemed satisfied. Mr. Topham, he said, I
have asked you to call on me for a purpose not connected, so far as I
see at present, with your mission to Japan. Concerning that, I have
nothing to add to the instructions already given you. Your reports
will, of course, be to the Secretary of the Navy and you will of course
not forget that your duties as naval attach to our embassy at Tokio
include the sending of any political information you may be able to
pick up, in addition to such naval and military details as you may
consider of importance. You speak Japanese, I believe?

Topham bowed. A little, he replied, modestly.

More than a little, I understand, corrected the Secretary. Doubtless
you will find your knowledge of great advantage to you in your work. It
is not of this, however, but of something quite different that I wish
to speak.

The Secretary paused, as if to give the young man a chance, but the
latter said nothing. He merely waited courteously until the Secretary
resumed.

Have you any special preference as to your route to Japan? he asked.

Topham shook his head. Very little, he answered. I have scarcely had
time. I supposed vaguely that I should go by San Francisco, because
that was the most direct route, but it makes no difference to me.

I should like you to go by Europe and the Suez Canal. Have you any
personal reason for desiring to go by Berlin?

Berlin? I dont know! Er--Isnt Mr. Rutile secretary of embassy
there?

The secretarys eyebrows went up a trifle. Yes! he answered. To
Topham his voice sounded a little sharp.

He was at Annapolis with me, but resigned shortly after being
graduated. We were always chums and I should be very glad to see him
again.

Very well! That will serve as an excellent excuse for your choice of
route. Kindly indicate to Admiral Brownson of the Bureau of Navigation
your desire to proceed by way of Berlin, and he will issue the
necessary orders. You will find that these will direct you to proceed
with due diligence via Berlin to Brindisi, where you will join the U.
S. S. Nevada as watch officer, relieving Lieutenant Shoreham, who is to
be invalided home. You will proceed on the Nevada to Manila, where you
will be detached, and will proceed at once to Tokio.

The Secretary paused and picked a long official document before him.
You might mention your plans to any officer or others whom you chance
to meet. I wish your choice of route to appear as natural as possible.
You understand?

Topham bowed. I understand, sir, he replied.

Very good. Now, Mr. Topham, permit me to ask whether your mention
of Mr. Rutile just now was purely accidental or whether you had any
information that I wanted you to take a confidential message to him.

Topham laughed. Do you really? he asked. No! Mr. Secretary! I had no
idea or information to that effect. It was altogether a coincidence, I
assure you.

Ah! I was beginning to wonder if there was a leak in my office. Well!
Mr. Topham, I wish you would take this packet and deliver it with
your own hands in private to Mr. Rutile. You must not let even the
ambassador know that you are carrying documents of any kind. No one is
to know, except Mr. Rutile and yourself. You understand?

Surely, sir.

Very good. Can you leave for New York tonight?

Certainly, sir.

Please do so! I am sorry to curtail your stay in Washington, but
there is no time to lose. Your passage has been taken on the steamer
Marlatic, which leaves for Hamburg tomorrow morning. Make all the speed
you can to Brindisi, remembering, however, that it is better to lose a
day or two than by any undue haste to cast doubt on the credibility of
your visit to Berlin. The Nevada will wait for you, though she is badly
needed at Manila.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The tone of this scene is businesslike and matter-of-fact. The point of view is third person limited, focused on the Secretary of State and Mr. Topham. There is a sense of urgency in the Secretary's voice, as he is eager for Mr. Topham to begin his journey to Japan as soon as possible.
