Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Ethel and Teddy were doing their best to preserve straight faces,
but the strain was too much. They, too, started to laugh.

Sure, go ahead! Nick said, with a grin. We dont mind it. I was
just showin the boys how to act tonight. You see, they dont know
nothin about polite society, an I--

Yea, I suppose you know it all! Pop Burns burst out. Teddy,
whats that crazy thing this coots been tellin us. What does
mahvis dance mean?

It means may I have this dance! Teddy answered. Nick, you take
the first prize. Where did you ever hear that?

What, mahvis dance? Nick asked. Why, thats what those New
Yorkers said over at Easton when they had that dance fer the benefit
of the starvin Negroes or somethin. I went to it, so I know. But
these hyenas, here, dont pay no attention to me!

You just go on explaining to them, Nick, Ethel advised, with a
smile. Youre perfectly right. Mahvis dance is correct.

There, I told you! Nick exclaimed triumphantly. Now mebby youll
listen! I _knew_ I was right!

Hes your friend for life, Roy declared, with a grin, as he,
Ethel, and Teddy walked back to the house, leaving the cowboys to
professor Nick Looker. Say, this dance will be a riot! Ill bet
every one of those boys, except, maybe, Pop Burns, is in love with
Norine! Theres going to be some wild struggle to decide who has the
first waltz with her!

Supper at the X Bar X was quickly concluded, and the hour for the
dance approached. By dint of much coaxing, Gus obtained permission
to sit on the side and watch.

Wont hurt me a bit, he proclaimed. I feel fine! Arm dont hurt
a-tall.

As the darkness deepened, Nell and Ethel became somewhat worried
about their evening dresses. Surely Bug Eye should have been here by
now. Mr. Manley went to the phone and called up the 8 X 8. When he
returned his face wore a puzzled look.

Pete Ball says Bug Eye started three hours ago. Hes got your
dresses in the flivver, an said he should have reached here by six
oclock. Something must have happened to him--a puncture, or a
blowout. Well just have to wait, thats all.

A half hour went by, and still no Bug Eye. Nell and Ethel began to
grow restless. The party would be a total failure without their
evening dresses, they felt.

Do you think hell come? Nell asked Mr. Manley, over and over
again.

Unless hes hurt, he will, the cattle owner responded. I guess
hell get here before the dance starts. Well wait till late before
the music begins.

But when nine oclock arrived and there was still no sign of Bug Eye
with the dresses, it was decided to go ahead. Ethel and Nell were
disappointed, but they made the best of it. Belle and her mother
lent them some scarfs and accessories, but they did not have dresses
that would fit either of the visitors.

I guess well just have to go without party gowns, Nell sighed
regretfully. But it would have been such fun if we could only be
dressed up like you, Belle!

Never mind, the boys wont know the difference, Belle consoled
them. And certainly Teddy and Roy wont mind. You can have just as
much fun in knockabout dresses. Anyway, Bug Eye might still arrive.

By nine-thirty all hope of getting the dresses was abandoned, and
the orchestra started to tune up. Sing Lung drew his bow across
the fiddle strings. Nick let out a blast on his mouth-organ. Jim
Casey sent into the air a long, wailing note from his accordion.

Every person on the ranch had gathered in the living room. Pop Burns
had his shoes polished until they rivaled the high-lights of his
bald head. Gus Tripp sat proudly in the seat of honor at the side of
the room, his arm swathed in bandages. Rad Sell was resplendent in a
new yellow-striped shirt. Also it was noticed that Nick Looker had
given up the idea of a diamond stickpin. He had on a green tie, as
did every other hand on the ranch. The punchers were waiting eagerly
for the music to start. And, Teddy noted gleefully, Norine stood
demurely in a corner, garbed in a _red_ dress!

Mr. and Mrs. Manley watched the scene with happy smiles. They were
parents of children almost grown, but there were no younger people
in that room than those two.
