SCENE:
II THE FIRST DIP UNDER THE SURFACE


By degrees this feeling of depression passed away. They were healthy
boys, and as such could not long remain in the grip of the blues. It
was all their own doings, too, and they were headed for an experience
that certainly no other young fellows had ever been given before.

Soon they were taking an interest in all that went on around them.
Oyster boats with the men at work dredging or tonging; duck hunters in
blinds, or lying, it might be, in sink-boxes on the shallows with their
decoys all around them--things like these were constantly cropping
up to be observed through the marine glasses which they had been
thoughtful enough to provide themselves with before starting on the
voyage.

The afternoon sun was sinking toward the western horizon, and it was
figured that by morning they would have arrived close to the ocean at
Hampton Roads.

How fast are we going, do you think, boys? Ballyhoo was asking, while
they continued to sit there and enjoy the bracing air of that late Fall
afternoon.

Thats hard to decide, Oscar told him. I understand that this boat
can make about seventeen miles on the surface of the water, providing
the sea is fairly calm. We may be doing nearly that right now.

And when she sinks down under the sea, what is she capable of doing
then? continued Ballyhoo, always eager for facts.

Oh! I think it was about eight or nine knots an hour, which would be
pretty good, all things considered, Oscar replied.

Our quarters are pretty cramped and well be crowded a whole lot,
Jack said in a reflective way, but we expected that before we came.
Your uncle told us, Ballyhoo, wed likely have to put up with many
discomforts, and lack of space would be one of them.

Whats the odds so long as were happy, Ballyhoo Jones laughingly
declared. We can be as snug as three bugs in a rug. There are some
things a heap worse than being crowded. Sitting up in a bally old tree
the livelong night, with a pair of hungry lions prowling around under
you is one of them.

Yes, you know all about that sort of thing, Ballyhoo, chuckled Oscar;
also how being almost devoured by cannibal ants feels. But were not
going to run across anything like that on _this_ trip, I reckon.

Oh! give things a chance, boys, said Ballyhoo, confidently, and
therell be adventures a-plenty cropping up to make our hearts jump
like mad. This time it may be storms, pirates, a damaged engine while
were lying at the bottom of the sea so we cant rise for air, and all
that sort of thing.

What are you staring so hard at through the glasses, Jack? asked
Oscar, giving little heed to the pleasant prospect thus outlined so
cheerfully by Ballyhoo, for he knew very well the other was only joking
when he rattled these possible perils off so glibly.

Why, I was watching that black steam yacht over there a mile or so
away from us, Jack remarked, lowering the marine glasses as he spoke.
I could see a fellow in some sort of uniform holding glasses on us
right along. I guess he must be wondering whether we mightnt prove to
be a German submarine that had strayed across the broad Atlantic, like
they threaten to do some of these fine days, to sink British munition
steamships close to our shores, rather than wait for them to get over
into the waters theyve marked as the war zone.

I tell you what I think, he observed a minute afterwards, that same
black steam yacht may be our rival, the _Dauntless_, and the man who is
watching us all the while would then be that rollicking old world-wide
adventurer, Captain Badger, who has sailed the Seven Seas from boyhood,
been everything from blockade-runner to naval officer, and perhaps a
little of a pirate on the sly besides.

Whew! do you really think so, Oscar? cried Ballyhoo; please let me
have a peek at him then. Ive heard so much about the old reprobate Id
love to say Id actually set eyes on his phiz, even at a mile away.

We may see a little more of him than we want, before were done with
this job, Oscar told him, with the air of a prophet, but Ballyhoo only
laughed, for he was not the one to cross any bridge before he came to
it.

Just then Captain Barnaby Shooks, the man who had been placed in full
charge of the treasure-hunting expedition by the incorporated company,
came up the ladder from the conning-tower of the submarine boat. He was
a grizzled old sea dog, who had seen much of life on many waters, and
was well qualified to manage just such a strange mission as the one
that had been placed in his hands.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The boys are excited to be on their submarine voyage and are eager to explore all the sights they see. They spot a black steam yacht in the distance and wonder if it could be their rival, the _Dauntless_. Captain Barnaby Shooks comes up from the conning-tower and tells them it is time to go below for the night.
