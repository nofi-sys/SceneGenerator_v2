SCENE:
The team, fifteen strong exclusive of manager and assistant manager
and Mr. Sargent and Dinny Crowley and Davy Richards, left on the
later train. A five-minute wait at the junction, spent in working off a
little extra enthusiasm, and then they boarded the main line train and
were hustled away toward Greenbank and whatever fate awaited them.

Of course most everyone hoped for a second victory since it would
leave them free to go home for the summer, but there were one or two
enthusiasts who were willing to see the series go to three games. Among
the latter was Dud, for Dud wanted very much indeed to pitch in one
Mount Morris contest, and he saw no likelihood of doing it unless that
third game was played. Most of the fellows proclaimed their belief that
Grafton would again take the measure of her opponent this afternoon,
but secretly they doubted it. Mount Morris had nearly always taken one
game, and today, playing on her own field, surrounded by her graduation
crowd, and smarting under the defeat of last week, she was certain to
make a fine fight for victory.

Mr. Sargent, Murtha, Barnes and Mr. Crowley occupied seats together
and spent most of the time between Needham Junction and Greenbank
laying plans for the contest. Dud and Jimmy sat together further back
in the coach, Jimmy doing his best to make Star Meyer uncomfortable
by staring at the back of his head. There was a good deal of talk and
laughter and some horse-play, for the fellows had the coach pretty much
to themselves until Webster was reached. There was a delay at Webster,
for a branch line train with which the express made connection had not
arrived. Most of the fellows disembarked to stretch their legs and
harry the station agent, and Jimmy and Dud were of the number. Jimmy
insisted on taking his stand on the platform opposite the window at
which Star sat and staring him out of countenance until Dud dragged him
away by main force.

Ill bet, chuckled Jimmy as, having promised to behave, he obtained
his release from his chums grasp, Ill bet that Star will be glad
when he hikes out for home! I never knew a fellow who disliked to be
looked at as much as he does!

Looked at! said Dud. Youre enough to drive the fellow crazy!
I wouldnt be surprised if he dreams of you at night, you and
yourerbacillus stare!

I think the word is _basilisk_, replied Jimmy sweetly. Not that it
matters, however. Not that anything matters except whether I beat that
chump out for the position of center fielder today. Say, where are you
taking me? Suppose the train starts up?

It wont. You heard the trainman say we were waiting for the local,
and that comes in over there on the other side of the station. Lets
see if there are any fish in this stream.

Who cares whether there are or not? But Jimmy followed along the
embankment to lean beside Dud over the railing of the culvert and stare
into the little brook that flowed beneath. I see a frog down there,
if that will do you any good. Id like to catch him and put him down
Stars neck!

They had wandered some forty or fifty yards back from the rear car,
which the team had taken possession of, and consequently when a bell
clanged far down the track and the command All abo-o-oard! reached
them, as it did at that moment, they didnt waste time in expressing
surprise or consternation but set off as fast as their feet would carry
them.

That trainman, panted Jimmy, will come to a bad end!

Whether the conductor failed to see them or whether he gave them credit
for an astonishing celerity they never knew, but the train began to
move before they had covered half the distance between the culvert and
the last platform of the rear car. Running over ties is not conducive
to speed and for a moment or two they despaired of reaching their
goal. But they did reach it, just when the end of the station platform
threatened to defeat their efforts, and Jimmy, leading, grasped a
handful of iron railing and gave a spring.

What happened next was always very confused in their minds. They had
noticed that the rear platform was occupied by someone, but had not
recognized who that someone was. As Jimmys fingers closed about the
railing at the steps a rubber-soled shoe was placed against his chest
and the very next thing Jimmy knew he was rolling over on the platform
and Dud was rolling over with him, and the train was rods away!

[Illustration: Jimmy ... was rolling over on the platform and Dud ...
with him]

Struggling somehow to his feet, Jimmy gave chase, shouting like a wild
Indian and causing a stupendous commotion amongst the few occupants of
the platform. But all he got for his pains was an ironic farewell wave
from the figure in the doorway of the last car!

Dud, rather pale of face, joined him, dusting his clothes and staring
dazedly after the disappearing express. Jimmy, wild-eyed, turned
sputteringly.
