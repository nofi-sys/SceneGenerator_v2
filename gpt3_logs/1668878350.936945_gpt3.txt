SCENE:
If the cow hadnt stopped to chase a fly off her back, the train
wouldnt have hit her, Roy retorted facetiously. Suppose we had
caught The Pup? What would we have done with him?

Plenty, Teddy answered. Gotten some of dads four hundred
smackies back, anyway. He cant have spent it all this soon. Chances
are, hes got most of it with him.

What he aint spent fer booze, Bug Eye interjected contemptuously.
The Pup aint worth the powder to blow him up, though Id chip in
my little bit to stand part of the expense if any one wanted to try
it, he chuckled. Well, I guess you can kiss the money goodbye,
Roy. An the bronc too. Whatever you say about The Pup, he sure can
ride, an hell be ridin fer election by now. You boys tired
paddlin? Ill spell one of yuh, if yuh wants me to.

Pop accepted his offer, and once more the canoe slid on toward the
rapids, still many miles downstream. There was much talk of the
possibility of seeing The Pup again, and Teddy was in favor of
unlimbering one of the rifles that lay in the bottom of the boat on
the chance. But Roy vetoed this idea, saying it was very necessary
that they keep the guns dry and clean.

Those rifles are our dinner-checks, you know, he added. When we
land, weve got to look lively and do a bit of hunting if we want to
eat. Suns almost down. We ought to make camp shortly. Soon as you
see a likely spot, Bug Eye, head for it.

There was a run of some fifteen minutes while not a word was spoken.
The only sound was the regular dip, dip, dip of the paddles,
propelling the canoe onward. Pop, the extremist, was either so
talkative that hed gab the ear off a brass monkey, to use Nick
Lookers expression, or else he kept strict silence. Bug Eye was
content to dream of the possibilities of his Fishmobile, and Teddy
was wondering how his father was making out.

They ought to be about in a line with us, the boy thought, though
far back behind those mountains. Hope they reach the cattle about
the time we get there. If that herd has done much wandering-- He
shook his head dubiously.

If they had traveled that far off their own range, there was no
telling how much farther they would go. Teddy hoped they would
travel beyond the danger of the landslide the stranger had told
about.

Roys thoughts were in a rather chaotic condition. The discovery of
The Pup had bothered him more than he cared to admit. Why was it he
was headed toward the Whirlpool River Ranch--Jake Trummers place?
Of course, it might be that he took that route because it offered
the greatest protection. Unconsciously Roy echoed Pop Burns
thoughts, and decided that the heavy brush along the river would
certainly be ideal for the concealment of a fugitive.

Presently his cogitations were interrupted by Bug Eye, who called
out:

How about this place ahead? Me, Im gettin hungry! All right,
Roy?

Sure, I guess so. Roy gazed at the small cove, then nodded. Fine,
Bug Eye. Get her up close, and Ill hop out and pull the canoe up.
Steady--

He leaped to the bank and grasped the bow of the craft. This he held
while the others stood up and tossed the blankets, food, and rifles
on the shore. Then the canoe was drawn up until it was nearly out of
water.

She stood up well, Teddy remarked, looking down at the boat.
To-morrow will tell. Well hit the rapids then, and give the ole
raft a good try-out. Oh, baby, Im stiff! He stretched high and
wide. Id hate to live in a canoe.

Id hate to live in a suitcase, too, but why worry about things
like that? Roy laughed. Here, you navigator, see what you find.
He handed his brother a rifle. If you catch anything less than
three inches, throw em back.

Now, by golly, thats an idea! Teddy exclaimed. Fishing with a
rifle. Ive heard of it, but Ive never seen it done. Id like to
try it.

How do you mean? Pop asked interestedly, ceasing from his labors
of untying the blanket roll.

Why, shoot the fish!

The old man cackled sarcastically.
