SCENE:
XVI


MATSON MAKES HIS GATHER

LIKE wildfire the news spread through western Wyoming that Tait and
Gilroy had been shot down in their sheep wagon by night raiders. Soon
there was no ranch so deep-hidden in the hills, no herders camp so
remote that the story had not been carried there. The tale was a
nine-days wonder, a sensation that gave zest to colourless lives. The
identity of the raiders was a mystery that promised much pleasant
gossip.

Furtive whispers of names began to be heard. That of Falkner was
mentioned first. He had made threats against Tait, and he was known to
be quarrelsome and vindictive. Then the murmured gossip took up the name
of McCoy, added shortly to it those of Cole and Silcott. It was known
that all four of the suspected men had been absent from the round-up the
night of the killing. Two of them were enemies of Tait, the others had
been mixed up in the cattle-sheep feud. By their own statements they had
all been together during the hours when the raid took place.

The gossipers had no direct evidence, but a great deal of opinion was
whispered back and forth in corrals, on porches, and in the saddle. The
sentiment was general that Tait had for a long time laid himself open to
such an end. But Gilroy was a good citizen, not turbulent, friendly to
his neighbours. His murder stirred a deep but not too loudly expressed
resentment.

Meanwhile Sheriff Matson moved about his business of gathering evidence
with relentless singleness of purpose. He, too, heard whispers and
followed them to sources. He rode up and down the country piecing this
and that together until he had a net of circumstance encircling the
guilty ones.

From one of the herders whom McCoy had saved he gathered valuable
information. The man had been awakened by the sound of firing. He had
run to the door of the wagon in time to see Gilroy shot down. Tait was
already down. The herder had been saved by one of the attackers who had
stood between him and another and prevented the second man from
murdering him. The first man had called the other one Hal. The raiders
were all masked and he had not recognized any of them.

I aint lost any of them raiders, Mr. Sheriff, the man said with a
kind of dogged weakness. If I know too much, why someone takes a shot
in the dark at me an thats the last of Johnnie Mott. No, sir, I done
told you too much already. I was plumb excited, an maybe I aint got it
jest the way it was. He mighta called the other fellow Hardy instead of
Hal.

He might have, but he didnt, Mott. Keep yore mouth shut and you dont
need to worry about gettin shot. Ill look after you if youll stay
right here in town. You can hold down that job I got you as janitor at
the court house. Nobodys gonna hurt you any.

One of the whispers Matson heard took him to Dunc King. That young man
had, as usual, been talking too much. The sheriff found him at his
mothers ranch mending a piece of broken fence.

Lo, Dunc. Hows everything? the officer asked by way of greeting.

The young man looked at him with suspicion and alarm. Why, all right, I
reckon. Hows cases with you, Sheriff?

I hear you had a little talk with Hal Falkner the night of the raid. Do
you remember exactly what he said to you?

Why, no. I dont remember a thing about it, the young man returned
uneasily. He knew his tongue had once more tripped him up.

You will if you think hard, dont you reckon? You remembered it well
enough to tell Flanders and Mrs. Henson. Ill start you off. Falkner an
you were discussing the reason why so many men left camp after supper.
He told you Larry Silcott had told him Tait was across the dead line
again. Recollect that?

Why, no. I dont guess I do, Sheriff.

Youd better, Dunc, onless you want to get into mighty serious
trouble.

Sho! Nothing to that, Sheriff. Nothing a-tall. I mightve got to
shootin off my mouth the way I sometimes do. Kinda playin like I was
on the inside, y understand.

Or, on the other hand, you might be trying to duck out from
responsibility, Dunc. Dont make any mistakes, boy. Youre going to come
through with what you know.

But Im tellin you I dont know a thing, the boy protested.
