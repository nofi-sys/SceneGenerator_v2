SCENE:
VI

To Whirlpool River


Gus Tripp! Roy muttered to himself. And The Pup! I wonder if I--
Coming to a sudden decision, he threw the currying brush on the
ground and stepped forward. It took but a moment to reach the cook
house, and without hesitating he walked around to the side. It was
in his mind to speak to Gus and tell him Mr. Manley would like to
see him. But when he rounded the corner he stopped short. There was
no one in sight! Puzzled, Roy glanced within the shack. The only
person there was Sing Lung, the cook, who grinned widely as he saw
Roy.

Hungly? he demanded. You boy betta have plenty eat, you lide
long, yes?

Yep, we got a long ride ahead of us, Roy returned absently. Say,
Sing, did you hear two men talking outside here?

Who men?

Well, I think they were Gus Tripp and Joe Marino. I could hear em
away over by the hitching rail, so you must have heard em too.

Me? Nope, I hear nobody. I lun wata--see? He turned on the kitchen
faucet, and the noise of the stream beating against the tin of the
sink made even thinking difficult, let alone talking.

All right, shut it off, Roy yelled. I understand. But why you
dont break every dish in the place with that torrent I cant see.
Guess you didnt hear anything. He stepped into the yard again.
Gazing toward the road as it rose into the mountains past Eagles,
the ranch town, Roy discerned two horsemen. The boy nodded.

There they go--Gus and The Pup. Wish I could have got here sooner,
so I could have talked to Gus. Now I suppose hes gone for good.
Wonder what he meant by saying he may have been an idiot, but he
wasnt a polecat? I dont like that Joe Marino! Chances are he
wanted Gus to go in with him on some shady scheme, and Gus refused.
Good for Gus! Wish he was back with us. Roy shook his head, and,
seeing Pop Burns walking across the yard, asked him where Teddy was.
He was told the boy was talking with his father over at the corral,
and, intending to tell them that Gus had returned but had ridden
away again, Roy hurried forward.

When he reached the corral he saw that Nick Looker had come back.
What he was saying evidently was of interest, for both Teddy and Mr.
Manley were listening eagerly.

Roy, I want you to hear this, the ranch owner called as Roy came
up. Nick, tell him what you told us.

Well, it was just that I had a talk with Bob McKeever--hes a hand
on the Whirlpool River Ranch. Ive knowed him for quite a spell. Bob
says The Pup told Jake Trummer that we put our cattle to his grass
on purpose, and that The Pup had orders to let em roam as much as
they wanted. And I found out how all those breaks got in the fence,
too--they been cut. I came across a pair of wire pliers down by the
east fence.

Marino told Mr. Trummer that we put our cows in his fields on
purpose? Roy repeated amazed. What did he ever say a thing like
that for?

Nick shrugged his shoulders.

Dont ask me. I only know what I been told. Guess thats reason
enough for old man Trummer to go up in the air, hey, boss?

It certainly is, Mr. Manley said slowly. I wish I had known this
before. Things would have been different. What else did McKeever
say, Nick?

Well, he said he heard his boss swear that if them dogies werent
off his land by to-morrow, hed drive em into the river. And he
would, too--old man Trummer is some hot-headed.

I know he is, Mr. Manley said. He thought for a moment. If I
thought it would do any good, Id phone him. But Im afraid that
would make things worse. Nope, we got to take our medicine. Drat
that Joe Marino! I should have thrown him off long ago! Now look at
the mess hes got us in! Snap to it now, boys, we start right soon.
Got no time for delays. Nick, you come with us. Teddy and Roy, I
expect you to take complete charge of the ranch while were gone.

You mean were to stay, Dad? Teddy asked, a disappointed look
coming over his face. Up to this moment the boy had fully expected
to go with the others to Whirlpool River.
