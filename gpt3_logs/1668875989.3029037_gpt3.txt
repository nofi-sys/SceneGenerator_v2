Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
XXVII


Through the night, full speed, with all lights extinguished, ran the
Watson, her only guide the information contained in Rutiles brief
and indefinite message over the wireless. If this were correct--if
the yacht had indeed run due east for half an hour and if she should
continue in the same direction and at the same speed, and if her speed
were about 18 knots an hour (as it probably was), it was a mere matter
of calculation to determine where and when the Watson would overtake
her.

But there were many ifs in these premises. The night was dark; the
moon had set hours before, and the stars were invisible behind a
light film of clouds. If the Windbird should run without lights, as
she certainly would if Ouro Preto should suspect pursuit (and as she
might in any case), she would be invisible even at close range, unless
betrayed by the glow from her funnels. To find her without further help
from Rutile would be like seeking a needle in the darkest sort of a
haystack. Even with Rutiles aid, Topham felt that he had no right to
hope to find her while night lasted. He did hope, however, to hang so
closely on her heels that her smoke should be visible above the horizon
when morning dawned.

Swiftly the moments sped by, and steadily the destroyer ate up the
miles supposed to intervene between her and the yacht. No further
signals came, and Topham, not knowing what conditions might be on the
Windbird or who might read off any message that he might send flying
through the dark, forebore to call, despite Quentins advice to take
the chance.

He yielded only when the Watson had reached the spot where calculation
placed the Windbird.

I guess youd better call Rutile, Mr. Quentin, he ordered. Well be
passing the yacht the first thing we know.

Quentin was about to give the order when the operator suddenly began to
write.

Do you hear me? he scribbled, as the words come through the night.
Answer if you do.

I hear, tapped the operator.

Am using reduced power. Been ordered to call H. I. M. Kaiserland,
supposed to be somewhere near. Can see light from somebodys funnels
and suspect its yours or hers. If its yours youre due north of us,
mighty near.

Topham leaped for the companionway. South by east, Mr. Quentin, he
ordered. Half speed. Keep sharp lookout! Were close on her.

Tell him that, he ordered, turning back to the operator.

Good! Came the answer. You dont want the Kaiserland to beat you to
it. Shes an armored cruiser.

Quentin bent over the cabin skylight. Saw her funnels flash just now,
he cried, excitedly. How about the searchlight?

Turn it on.

Topham leaped on deck. As he did so the broad white sword of the
searchlight flashed through the darkness, lighting up the rolling water
and picking out the Windbird black against the night, scarce a cable
length away. The blinding light showed her every detail--showed her
masts and funnels and the white tracery of her rigging, silvered the
edges of the black smoke that trailed away behind her, and showed, too,
her half dozen rapid fire guns, with their crews manned and ready.

Hail them. Say youll send a boat, ordered Topham.

Quentin flung up his megaphone. Windbird ahoy, he bellowed. Heave
to. Ill send a boat aboard you.

As the words left his lips the Windbirds searchlight flashed out
and lighted up the bulk of the torpedo boat, long and low, far less
formidable to all appearances than the yacht.

A man on the yachts bridge raised a megaphone. Who are you? he
demanded.

Thats Ouro Preto talking, commented Topham, staring through his
glasses.

The United States Destroyer Watson. Heave to! ordered Quentin.

Go to hell!


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with the Watson, a US destroyer, racing through the night at full speed. The only guidance the ship has is a brief and somewhat vague message from another vessel, the Windbird. If the information in the message is correct, the Watson should be able to overtake the Windbird. However, there are many variables that could make the situation more difficult, such as the darkness of the night and the fact that the Windbird may be running without lights.
As the minutes pass, the destroyer closes in on the spot where the Windbird should be. Suddenly, the operator on the Watson receives a message from the Windbird. The message says that the Windbird is being pursued by an armored cruiser from Kaiserland and is close to the Watson.
Topham, the captain of the Watson, orders the searchlight turned on. The light reveals the Windbird, close to the Watson and with its guns manned and ready. Topham orders Quentin, the man operating the megaphone, to hail the Windbird and tell them that he will send a boat over.
The man on the Windbird's bridge, who is revealed to be Ouro Preto, megaphones back an expletive and tells the Watson to go to hell.
