SCENE:
That may have been the Prime Minister, said Saidee Isaacs.

Fay stared upward at the leaden vault of the London sky. He was between
two minds. The House of the Lions might be a cunningly-baited trap of
the superior order.

Come on, Saidee, he said, throwing away his last resolve for safety.
Well go in the house. Well see Sir Richard. If its a traptheyll
never give me another chance for a get-away.

She thrust her hands in the pockets of her skirt and leaned toward him.

I never knew Sir Richard to play false, she said. Hes too smart a
man to do anything like that. I dont think we needed to run away.

Fay arched his brows. He followed her down the sidewalk and turned with
her into the pathway which led to the House of the Lions. He stood on
the steps as she knocked lightly. The three motors were blocking the
road. Their chauffeurs were huddled in the front seats waiting for
orders. They all had the appearance of sincerity. Fay entered the door
after the girl.

Sir Richard beamed through the gloom of a half-illuminated hallway. Ah,
my runaways! he chuckled. Come right in! Weve company of note
tonighta cracksman, a lady of class, a Prime Minister, an M. P. and the
Secretary of the Home Office. I want you to meet them, Fay. They are
terribly interested in how you found the secret of the German
dye-cipher. You should have stayed until the discovery, he added with
cryptic smiling.

Fay allowed the girl to precede him through the doorway which opened
into the large room where stood three men who held themselves like
Empire-builders. These men stared curiously at Sir Richard as he
motioned for MacKeenon and the little Scotch detective to take places at
the door.

The chief of the investigation bureau rounded the table, drew up a chair
and sat down. He leaned forward and fastened upon Saidee Isaacs and Fay
the level scrutiny of a man who was vastly pleased with the turn of
affairs. He rubbed his hands and beamed upon the company. In some
manner, his strong jaw had softened. The bulges at the sides were not so
prominent.

Germany, he began speaking, is checkmated. All that sad country knows
about making dyes shall now be known to England and America. The secret
is out!

The smaller member of the group of three men, whom Fay surmised was the
Prime Minister who had fought Germany to a knock-out, stepped to the
table and threw back the lid of the nearest tin box. He brought forth a
sheet of paper between his steady, well-manicured fingers. He held it
out with a smile.

Sir Richard reached for this sheet as he darted a sly aside toward Fay.

We have here, said the chief, an ordinary piece of fairly good
typewriting paper. It was made in Germany. It contains thirty-two lines
of lettersgrouped three letters together. They read
aaahhhsssaaacccstopxxxgggssstttstopmmmwww and so on. It has long been
suspected that the cipher was written between the lines or on the back
of the sheets. No chemical reaction that we tried brought any
satisfactory result. We tried them all. It remained for chance to solve
the puzzle in a satisfactory manner.

Sir Richard glanced at the cluster of lights that bathed the room in
white. He blinked and held out the sheet. He reached and picked up the
pair of tinted goggles which MacKeenon had brought from the stable.

These glasses, he said, are not sufficiently opaque to answer the
purpose. Fay, he added with a twinkle, you are to be complimented on
your enterprise. You took that safe, in the country north and east of
here, like Haig took Cambrai. You held the secret. You lost it and
gained it again. You threw it away and then thought better of the matter
when you followed the cardsharper to see why he wore smoked-glasses. I
know why he wore them!

Why? said Fay quickly.

Because hes a genius in his own peculiar line. I hope to have the
pleasure of sending him away sometime. With the kind of glasses he
wears, no man is safe in a friendly poker game.

Fay stared at Saidee Isaacs. She crimsoned over the memory of the
thirty-odd pounds she had lost to Harry Raymond.

Id like to know how he does it? she asked.

Sir Richard laid the sheet of paper on the table. He tossed the tinted
glasses to one side as he rose and pointed toward the snap-switch on the
wainscoting.
