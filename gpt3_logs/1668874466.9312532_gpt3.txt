What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Hmp! he grunted. You got yore mind made up, I see.

Yes, she admitted, and added diplomatically, if you approve.

Whether I approve or not, he grinned. A lot you care about me
approvin. Youre some bull-haided when you get started, if you ask me.

If you can show me that I am wrong, of course

He threw up his hands. I cant. I wouldnt ever try to show a lady she
was wrong. All I can do is get ready to say, I done told you so when
you waken from yore dream about makin two haids of lettuce grow where
there aint any growin now.

You think I wont make it grow, and Ill lose money? she asked.

Why, yes, maam. I hate to say so, but thats sure how it looks to me.

She gave him her vivid smile. Youre going to live to take off your hat
and apologize humbly, Mr. Jennings, she prophesied.

I sure hope so.

Ruth made her preparations to go ahead and assumed that the foreman was
as enthusiastic as she was. She did not have to assume that he was loyal
and would support her project with a whole heart when it once got under
way.

Though she had a healthy interest in making the most of the ranch,
Ruths real absorption was in the baby. He was a continuous joy and
delight.

Rowan, junior, was king of the Circle Diamond from his birth. He ruled
imperiously over the hearts of the three women. It was natural that Ruth
should love him from the moment that they put him in her arms and his
little heel kicked her in the side. He was the symbol of the love of
Rowan that glowed so steadfastly in her soul. So she worshipped him for
his own sake and for the sake of the man she had married. The small body
that breathed so close to her, so helpless and so soft, filled her with
everlasting wonder and delight.

His daily bath was a function. Ruth presided over it herself, but Norma,
and often Mrs. Stovall, too, made excuses to be present. His plump legs
wrinkled into such kissable creases as he lay on his back and waved them
in the air, his smiling little mouth was such an adorable Cupids bow
that the young mother vowed in her heart there never had been such a boy
since time began.

But she did not coddle him. His mother had read the latest books on the
care of babies, and she intended to bring him up scientifically. He
spent a large part of his time sleeping on a screened porch, and, as he
grew older, Ruth took him with her when she drove over the place on
business.

In every letter she wrote Rowan the baby held first place, but she was
careful to show him that the boy was _his_ son as well as hers, a bond
between them from the past and a promise for the future. In one letter
she wrote:

I took Boy up into the pine copse back of the house this
afternoon. We were there, you and I and he, and we had such a
lovely time.

Isnt it strange, dear, that the things we care about become so
infinitely a part of all life that touches us? There is no
beautiful thing of sound or vision or colourno poignancy of
thought or feelingthat does not become a sign, somehow, for
the special gladnessas though, at bottom, all beauty and
dearness rested on the same foundation. To-day the wind has
blown swift and gray and strong, so that the hills are purple
with it, and the marching pines are touched to a low, tremendous
murmur. It is magnificent, as though something too vast and
solemn for sight passed by and one could hear only the sweeping
of its wings. And the thrill of it is one and the same with the
gladness of your letter of yesterday. There is in the heart of
them both something finer and bigger than I once could have
conceived.

While I was putting Rowan, junior, to bed I showed him your
picturethe one the Denver _Times_ photographer took just after
you won the championship last yearand he reached out his
dimpled fingers for it and spluttered, Da-da-da-da-da. I
believe he knows you belong to him. Before I put his nightie on
I kissed his dear little pink body for you.

Do you know that we are about to entertain distinguished
visitors at the Circle Diamond? Louise McDowell and the governor
are going to stay with us a day on their way to Yellowstone
Park. I cant help feeling that it is a good omen. Last year
when I went to Cheyenne he would not give me any hopesaid he
could not possibly do anything for me. But there has been a
great change of sentiment here. Tim Flanders talked with the
governor not long since, and urged a parole for you. I feel sure
the governor would not visit me unless he was at least in doubt.
