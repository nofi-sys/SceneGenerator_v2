What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Cloud did relax, but gingerly. He did not like this mind-to-mind stuff
at all, particularly when the other mind belonged to such a monster. He
lowered his mental barriers skittishly, ready to revolt at any instant.
But as soon as he began to understand the meaning of her thoughts he
forgot utterly that he was not talking man to man. The interchange was
not as specific nor as facile as is here to be indicated, of course,
but every detail was eventually made perfectly clear.

"I demand Darjeeb's life!" was her first intelligible thought. "Not
because he is my enemy and the enemy of all my race--that would not
weigh with you--but because he has done what no one else, however
base, has ever been so lost to shame as to do. In the very capital of
our city upon Lune he kindled an atomic flame which is killing us in
multitudes. In case you do not know about atomic flames, they can never
be--"

"I know--we call them loose atomic vortices. But they can be
extinguished. That is my business, putting them out."

"Oh--incredible but glorious news!" Luda's thoughts seethed, became
incomprehensible. Then, after a space, "To win your help for my race
I perceive that I must be completely frank with you," she went on.
"Observe my mind closely, please, so that you may see for yourself
that I am withholding nothing. Darjeeb wants at any cost the secret
of your vessels' speed. With it his race will destroy mine utterly.
I want it too, of course--if I could obtain it we would wipe out the
Uhalians. However, since you are so much more powerful than could
be believed possible, I realize that I am helpless. I tell you,
therefore, that both Darjeeb and I have long since summoned help.
Warships of both sides are approaching to capture one or both of these
vessels. Darjeeb's are nearest, and these secrets must not, under any
conditions, go to Uhal. Dash out into space with both of these vessels,
so that we can plan at leisure. First, however, kill that unspeakable
murderer. You have scarcely injured him the way it is. Or, free me,
give me that so-deceptive little axe, and I will be only too glad--"

A chain snapped ringingly, and metal clanged against metal. Only two of
Darjeeb's major arms had been incapacitated; his two others had lost
only a few fingers apiece from their respective hands. His immense
bodily strength was almost unimpaired; his feeding hand was untouched.
He could have broken free at any time, but he had waited, hoping
that he could take Cloud by surprise or that some opportunity would
arise for him to regain control of this lifeboat. But now, deeming it
certain that the armored biped would follow Luda's eminently sensible
advice, he decided to let inertialessness go for the time being, in the
interest of saving his own life.

"Kill him!"

Luda shrieked the thought and Cloud swung his weapon aloft. But Darjeeb
was not attacking. Instead, he was rushing into the airlock--escaping!

"Go free, pilot!" Cloud commanded, and leaped; but the heavy valve
swung shut before he could reach it.

As soon as the lock could be operated the Tellurian went through it. He
knew that Darjeeb could not have boarded the cruiser, since every port
was locked. He hurried to his control room and scanned space. There the
Uhalian was, falling like a plummet under the combined forces of his
own drive and the gravitations of two worlds. There also were a dozen
or so spaceships, too close for comfort, blasting upward.

Cloud cut in his Bergenholm, kicked on his driving blasts, cut off, and
went back into the lifeboat.

"Safe enough now," he announced. "They'll never get out here inert. I'm
surprised that he jumped--didn't think he was the type to kill himself."

"He isn't. He didn't," Luda said, dryly.

"Huh? He must have! That was a mighty long flit he took and his suit
wouldn't hold air."

"He would stuff something into the holes--if necessary he could make it
the whole distance without either air or armor. He is tough. He still
lives--curse him! But it is of no use for me to bewail that fact now.
Let us make plans. You must extinguish that flame and the leaders of
our people will have to convince you that--"

"Just a sec--quite a few things we've got to do first." He fell silent.

First of all, he had to report to the Patrol, so that they could get
Lensmen and a battle fleet out here to straighten up this mess. With
his short-range communicators, that would take some doing--but wait, he
had a double-ended tight beam to the Laboratory. He could get through
on that, probably, even from here. He'd have to mark the lifeboat as a
derelict and get these folks aboard his cruiser. No space-tube. He had
an extra suit, so he could transfer the women easily enough, but this
Luda....


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish the conflict between the two races and to introduce the idea that Darjeeb is trying to escape.
