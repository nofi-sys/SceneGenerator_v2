SCENE:
Oh, no! Some stage-people are dreadful bores, and many are coarse
and many commonplace. They are not all alike, you know, any more than
people off the stage.

But all the actors I have ever met have been so bright and amusing. I
know two who were at the Regency, where you acted--Mr. Gibson and Mr.
Cooke.

Oh, yes; I heard them say they knew you!

Dont you like them? Are they nice in the theater? They are two of the
best-bred men I have ever known.

They are very nice men, indeed, and very clever actors; I like them
both immensely.

And Mr. Gibson is so handsome, and does not seem to know it. But he
must, for I should think all the women in the theater must be in love
with him. Were you not a little in love with him?

In love with a beggarly cad of an actor? shouted Harry, scandalized.

You dont know what you are talking about! said his sister, coolly.
Of course your manners are not those of Mr. Gibson; they are those of
his valet. Didnt you think him very handsome, Annie?

Yes, very. And he has such a sweet voice.

Her husbands voice, for the moment not at all sweet, uttered a
growling protest.

And Mr. Cooke? He is not handsome, but he is charming. Dont you like
him? Oh, I know you must, for I saw that you had marked his name in a
critique in your paper!

Annie blushed as she answered that he was very nice, too, and very
clever; she had an uneasy feeling that her husband was glaring at her
across the table and noting her change of color.

During the few minutes which remained of the ladies stay in the
dining-room, Harry never took his eyes off his wifes face; and she was
conscious of this, though she did not once look at him.

In the drawing-room Lilian was quite affectionate.

You were always a good little girl; but I had no idea you would bloom
into such a clever woman, said she, with her white hands on the
shoulders of the smaller woman.

How--clever? asked Annie, laughing.

Why, at keeping your own counsel! But you may trust me. There is
always some one nicer than ones husband, and when ones husband is
Harry! I think your discretion does you great credit. As soon as I
heard you were on the stage, I tried to find out who it was that
had induced you to go on, or to remain on; and you had been so very
discreet that nobody could link your name with any other. And it was
not until I mentioned those two names at dinner that I found you out.
And nobody could have seen you wince but me. I am very clear-sighted in
these matters.

Indeed! said Annie, calmly. And may I know which of my fellow-actors
I am dying for love of?

I did not say that. I know your conduct is circumspection itself. But
I know which of these two gentlemen is--nicer than Harry.

Oh, you might put them both together and bracket a good many more with
them under that heading! said Annie.

I dare say. But you need not look so ostentatiously indifferent. I
should think it must be impossible to know Mr. Gibson well without
admiring him.

Well, that is true, certainly, assented Annie, not giving the least
sign of the relief she felt at hearing Lilian utter the wrong name.

She did not in the least mind that her sister-in-law should imagine
her to have a preference for Mr. Gibson; but she would not for worlds
have it suspected that she could have the faintest warmth of feeling
for--Mr. Cooke.

When the gentlemen came into the drawing-room, Harry was not among
them, and William said he had gone up-stairs to his room. A few minutes
later a servant came in to Annie, asking if she would go to Mr. Harold,
who had sent word to say that he was ill and wanted her particularly.
She went at once, and judged, as soon as she entered his room, that
his ailment concerned his temper more than his health.

You sent for me, Harry? What is the matter? Dont you feel well? she
asked kindly.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to reveal the strained relationship between the protagonist, Annie, and her husband, Harry. Annie is an actress, and Harry is deeply jealous of her male co-stars. In this scene, Lilian, Harry's sister, tries to get Annie to admit that she has feelings for one of her co-stars, but Annie deftly dodges the question. Harry is watching Annie closely during this conversation, and he is clearly angry with her when she refuses to give a straight answer. The scene ends with Annie being summoned to Harry's room, where he is waiting for her in a state of rage.
