SCENE:
Can you tell her name, questioned Lissa, as the man, with his eye
fixed upon the opposite wall, paused and seemed wrapped in thought.

It is a woman, young and beautiful. She must be a near relative. Her
name is E-l-s-i-eElsie.

Alice looked at her mother with awe-shaded eyes. Whence did this mans
knowledge come? It was certainly remarkable. He could not have known
Elsie.

Further speculation or conversation was arrested by the sound of a
horses feet outside the door, and in a moment the handsome, smiling
face of Mark Cramer appeared. His curling, yellow hair hung in womanish
profusion to his powerful shoulders, over which a large soft hat rested
becomingly. His hunting costume of gray, with belt and pistols, spoke of
his wild, free life; and his clear blue eyes, florid complexion, and
Herculean frame made a magnificent picture of manly strength and
perfection, as for a brief time he stood framed in the open doorway
against the back-ground of the setting sun.

A moment later, and Alice, with a little cry of welcome, sprang to greet
him. The Professor aroused himself from his semi-trance, and Mrs. Clyne
and Lissa were extending their hands and expressing surprise at his
coming.

How did you chance to come home so much earlier than you expected?
Alice asked radiantly, when the greetings were over and they were
seated. We did not look for you for a fortnight.

We lost one of our men, Wish-has-ta, and as he was to marry Enona,
daughter of the chief, when he returned, we thought it our first duty to
look him up, and so started back to see what had become of him.

And did you find him?

Well, yes, in town. He had become separated from us by buffalo. The mad
little mustang he rode kept along with the herd, in spite of him, for
several miles, or until at last he came to a ravine and managed to fall
into it. He narrowly escaped being trampled to death as the herd went
over him, but he got out with only a few injuries. He lost his pony,
however, and instead of following us, made his way back to camp. He left
word at C that he was safe, as he knew wed be looking for him.

And did you see Nathan, asked Lissa.

Yes, hell be home to-night too. I came into C early and called at
his place of business. Thats a fine place Nathan has, with the Major.
Good pay and light duties. Much better than his position at the post.

Yes, only it keeps him away from home more. And so you will both be
here to-night after all. Professor Russell, you have in this case proven
a true prophet.

I trust I am in every case, he replied, with an expressive gesture of
the hand. I do not rely upon lying spirits for my information.

Well, said Lissa, not perceiving Marks frown of disapproval, if we
have a seance here to-night we must get word to our neighbors.

I will myself go and call Mrs. McCleary and good Auntie Dearborn, said
Russell, and will get word to the Jenkinsons and Sol Garrett, if you
wish.

Be sure and have Esther McCleary present, said Mrs. Clyne. I am
greatly interested in that girl.

Certainly; no meeting would be complete without her, responded
Russell, bowing himself from the room.

Esther will not come if she can avoid it, said Alice after the
Professor had gone. She feels deeply mortified because of the
exhibition she was forced to make of herself at Mr. Jenkinsons. She
herself has no faith in spiritism, even though her mother is so absorbed
in it.

Poor girl, I pity her, Lissa said. It is a shame the way her mother
misuses her. Letting her have all the care of that large family, while
she sits in her easy chair and holds communion with spirits, as she
claims.

Was she always like that, asked Mrs. Clyne. I confess she impresses
me as being just a little out, tapping her forehead significantly.

She was quite an invalid when she first came here, replied Lissa, and
of course the burden of household care fell upon Esther, and since Mrs.
McCleary has been in better health she does not seem inclined to
shoulder responsibility of any kind, and Esther is cook, housekeeper,
and nurse to those children, as entirely as though she were the only
woman about the house. She is a delicate girl, too, and must break down
soon if she is not relieved of some of her burdens, Im afraid.
