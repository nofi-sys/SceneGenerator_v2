SCENE:
IV

A BLACK AND WHITE GOAT


JOHN gazed after them with longing in his eyes and resentment in his
heart. The longing was for the unattainable; the resentment that it
should be unattainable.

What a crassly idiotic, what an altogether blindly stupid, doltish,
and utterly mulish thing was convention! Here were three young, gay,
and delightful creatures enjoying the summer day in company, together
revelling in the glowing sun, the caress of the air soft as thistledown
upon ones face, the scent of the flowers and the warm earth, while
he--John--was condemned to loneliness, because, forsooth, of the lack
of four words. May I introduce you.

There was the password, the magic utterance which would have smoothed
away all difficulties. It could be spoken carelessly as you please.
It could be spoken by his worst enemy with as great effect as by his
dearest friend. Without it a barrier, high as the highest peaks of the
Andes, loomed between him and them, a barrier to him insurmountable,
indestructible, and named, labelled, and placarded in letters at least
a foot long, Convention. Small wonder that John fumed inwardly, the
while his eyes gazed after the vanishing three, distilled essence of
concentrated longing in their depths.

Chance alone could destroy the barrier,--Chance, the freakish, puckish
sprite, who sits with watchful eyes, smiling softly, impishly, till the
chosen moment arrives. Then, heigh presto! Chance springs light-footed
to your aid, is caught by you laughing, or in deadly earnest, according
to your needs. And if the latter, and your grasp is sure, you will
find it is no longer an impish, freakish sprite you hold, but a very
little demon, battling for you, trampling upon well-nigh incredible
difficulties, leading you triumphant to victory.

We cannot see Chance coming in deadly earnest to John at the moment.
The imp came mischievous, laughing, and perched, if you will believe
me, between the horns of a goat,--a large, a black and white, an
over-playful goat. It came prancing over the purple crest of the hill,
and bounded, curved, and gavotted in the direction of the momentarily
unconscious three.

The younger boy was the first to see it. He turned, startled atom,
to clutch at the ladys white dress, thereby causing her to become
aware of the presence of the intruder on the scene. The elder boy,
likewise made aware of its presence, seized a small stick from among
the heather, a fragile enough weapon, but with it he stood his ground,
a veritable small champion, facing the enemy boldly.

But think you that Chance, perched between those horns, was to be
daunted by a small boy in green knickerbockers, and holding a flimsy
stick? Not a bit of it! For no such paltry pretext would he desert our
John. I am very sure he but urged the goat forward, its advance in the
face of this defence lending greater colour to the danger.

Oh! breathed the white-robed lady, her hands going out protectingly
to the little figure clutching at her skirts. And then, Take care,
Tony, on a note of intense anxiety.

Here was the moment supplied by the mischievous imp. John recognized
the sprites wiles with fine intuition, cried him a fervent word of
thanks, and sprang to the rescue.

That Chance had never intended the slightest peril to the three, you
may be certain; since, once seized laughing from his perch by John, he
joined with him in ordering the goat to retire. Slightly bewildered at
this change of front, the goat gazed for a moment with reproachful eyes.

I was but playing the game you told me to play, you could fancy him
murmuring. Nevertheless, perceiving that the game was indubitably at
an end, he indulged in something very akin to a shake of his head, and
retired disconsolate whence he had come.

Oh, thank you, breathed the lady in white fervently. Boys, thank--
she paused. This gentleman savours too largely of the shop-walker;
the word has long since lost its rightful meaning. Our preserver
smacks of the pedant.

My name is John Mortimer, announced John, with one of his inimitable
smiles.

Mr. Mortimer, she concluded, the word supplied. I am Rosamund
Delancey, and this-- she indicated the whilom champion, is Antony,
and this is Michael. It was very good of you to come to our rescue.

John murmured the usual polite formula. For the life of him he could
find no original observation to make.

Possibly, continued Rosamund, half-meditative, a trifle rueful, the
goat intended mere play. But as Biddy, our old nurse, often used to
say--and still does, for that matter--Theres play _and_ play, and if
one of the parties ceases to be liking it, it will be no play at all.
The little laugh in her eyes found reflection in Johns.
