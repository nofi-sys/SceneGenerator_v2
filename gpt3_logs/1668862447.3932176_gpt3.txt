SCENE:
IV


SCOT McCLINTOCK INTRODUCES HIMSELF

Mark Twain tells us that in the early Nevada days it gave a man no
permanent satisfaction to shoot an enemy through both lungs, because the
dry air was so exhilarating that the wounded foe was soon as good as
new. Hugh McClintock was an illustration of this. He reached the Mormon
settlement a white-faced rag of humanity. But he had lived hard and
clean. The wind and the sun and able-bodied forbears had given him a
constitution tough as hammered brass. When his brother Scot drove from
Virginia City to see him, having heard the news that Hugh was wounded to
death, he found the boy wrapped in a blanket and sitting in the sunshine
at the corner of the ranch house. This was just a week after the end of
the young brothers wild ride.

Lo, Hugh! How are cases? asked Scot, his gay smile beaming down at
the boy.

Fine as silk, Scot. I got an appetite like a bear. Sorry you had to
come so far.

I hooked up soon as I heard about it, old fler. Now Ive seen you I
feel a lot better. The way I heard it you were ready to cash your
chips.

Scots arm was round the lads shoulder. The half-caress, the light in
the fine eyes, the warmth of the voice, all told of the strong affection
the older brother had for the younger. Hugh repaid this love with
interest. In his eyes Scot was an Admirable Crichton, the most wonderful
man he had ever been privileged to know. He trod the earth a king among
his raceand the king could do no wrong.

No two sons of the same father and mother could have been more unlike
than these. The last-born was counted steady as an eight-day clock,
reliable as tested steel. The other walked wild and forbidden paths. Yet
to call them unlike is to tell a half-truth. They had in common courage,
a certain cleanness of fibre, and an engaging gaiety. Scot McClintock
was nearly ten years older than Hugh, but there was a remarkable
physical resemblance between them. Each had inherited from a Scotch
father eyes of the same colour, a square-cut chin, and a strong Roman
nose. The head of each was crowned with curls of russet gold.

The shoulders of Scot were broader, his figure less stringy. He was of
splendid physique, tall, compact, powerful. Bearing himself with manly
grace, he radiated vitality. His chin told the truth. He was indomitably
resolute, a born leader. Vanity was his weakness. The spectacular
appealed. It had been said of him that he would rather break down a door
than wait for a key. The self-esteem of the man expressed itself in
clothes. These he wore always for effect, with the knowledge that his
fine figure would win him envy and admiration, even though he affected
the dandy. In his frock coat of doeskin with its flaring skirt and broad
lapels, his fancy vest cut wide to show a frilled shirt and blue satin
necktie, his pegtop trousers, his immaculately varnished boots, and his
flat-crowned silk derby, he was out of question the Beau Brummel of
Washoe. Another might have been laughed at for this punctilious devotion
to dress, but even in Virginia City nobody was hardy enough to poke fun
at Scot McClintock.

Many smiled with him, for this blue-eyed gambler had a thousand friends.
It was in his horoscope to fight or share his last dollar with you
gladly. He did not care which. He could be brave, reckless, generous,
sociable, or witty. But nobody could ever say that he was mean spirited.

Im going to take you back with me as soon as you can travel, Hugh, he
said.

Thatll be to-morrow moning.

Sure you can stand the jolting yet?

Sure. Ask Mother Jessup here.

The ranchers wife had come out from the house and been introduced to
Scot. Now she smiled comfortably at her patient. Hes doing fine.

He would, with you looking after him, Madam, Scot answered gallantly.

Its a Gods mercy he stuck on all those miles, wounded the way he was.
I dont see how he ever did, Mrs. Jessup said.

I reckon he clamped his teeth on the job. Hughs right obstinate when
he gets set, the older brother said with affectionate pride.

Runs in the family, Hugh cut back, grinning.

Maybe so. Well, tell me all about it, boy. Where did you jump the
Piutes? And how did you make your getaway?
