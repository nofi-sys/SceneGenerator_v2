SCENE:
XVII VIA WIRELESS


Some hours later and the queer looking undersea boat entered the harbor
of Curacao, belonging to the Dutch, and situated off Dutch Guiana. Here
their coming kicked up no end of a sensation, for it was immediately
supposed that this must be a German submarine, intending to raid
British commerce of the Caribbean; and all sorts of complications with
regard to the meaning of strict neutrality came up to worry the port
officials.

But the sight of Old Glory being flung to the breeze from the conning
tower of the unwelcome visitor reassured the officials. They were
later on stunned to learn that the _Argonaut_ was not a war vessel in
any way, but a peaceful commercial venture, and really what her name
signified, for she was seeking the Golden Fleece.

Here they were allowed to come to a dock and tie up, though closely
watched lest that flag overnight change into the double eagles of
Germany, and a dash be made for the open sea, there to commence the
work of nautical destruction.

It was a strange cargo that Captain Shooks contracted for. The crowds
that gathered around and watched, expecting to see ammunition brought
aboard, and possibly all sorts of war munitions and arms, stared to see
oil barrels, that were undoubtedly empty at that, being delivered by
the dozen, also stout planks of a certain size.

No sooner had they tied up than the three boys went ashore, camera in
hand, and bound to look the port over. They had often read about this
place, though none of them could remember whether it was famed for its
rum, molasses or cocoa. But Jack soon found interesting sights that
occupied his whole attention; and, besides, they certainly did enjoy
being able to stretch their legs again, after such a long siege aboard
the submersible.

It was on the following morning that Oscar had a peculiar thing happen
to him. He had gone ashore to make a little purchase, which had been
forgotten on the preceding day. Captain Shooks had told him they would
not start until four bells, or ten oclock, so the boy was taking his
time.

He noticed a young fellow hovering around him as he walked, and
wondered what it could mean. Presently the other seemed to make bold
enough to approach him, and Oscar noticed that the young chap had his
jaws set, as though fixed in some resolve.

Is your name Oscar? he asked the first thing.

Thats what it happens to be; what can I do for you? remarked the boy.

And did you come in yesterday aboard that submarine boat? continued
the other, apparently more relieved when he found that the boy met his
advances half-way.

Yes, with two chums of mine. Were taking motion pictures of deep
sea subjects, and going down in a submersible gives us plenty of fine
chances to get films of the queer things to be met with at the bottom
of the sea.

Well, do you happen to know anybody named Captain Badger? continued
the young man, at which, of course, Oscar started, for he realized that
something of importance was coming next.

I certainly know who the party is, he instantly replied; would you
mind telling me why you asked me that?

Im meaning to do just that same, continued the young fellow. My
name is John Baxter. I was aboard a schooner that came here to load
for Boston. I fell sick, and my captain deserted me here, without even
paying me what wages were due. And Ive had a hard time of it since I
got well. Right now Im not strong enough to work, and I want to get
back to my home in Savannah the worst kind. I thought perhaps you might
feel like helping me after Id told you something that came by wireless
last night.

Go on and tell me, said Oscar. Therell be no trouble about staking
you to enough money to get you home, if it proves to be worth anything
at all.

Why, you see, the other hurriedly went on to say, I got to know the
wireless operator here. I did some little thing to help him, and hes
been kind enough to let me sleep in his room at the station while hes
on duty. Ive picked up a little knowledge of the game myself, and can
read messages fairly well. Fact is, when I get back home Im bent on
taking a course in wireless, and trying for a job.

Yes, and what happened that you think concerns me? asked Oscar
impatiently.
