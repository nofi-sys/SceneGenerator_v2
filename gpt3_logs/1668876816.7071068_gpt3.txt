SCENE:
I couldnt have gone, Jimmy, with this plaguey toothache!

Why, no, I guess you couldnt. But, thunderation, Dud, if it isnt
a toothache its something else. Youve always got some perfectly
wonderful excuse for beating it about the time the fun begins. Not that
you missed much this afternoon, for you didnt, barring a lot of tired
muscles, but you often do miss things. To be what you call a mixer,
Dud, youve got to mix, and you dont know the first thing about it.
Fellows like you, all right, what they see of you, but you dont give
them a chance.

Dud stared thoughtfully at the green shade before him. Ye-yes, I
suppose thats true, Jimmy. But I dont like to stick around when
fellows are getting up things because I think that maybe they wont
want me in on it and that if Im there theyll think they have to ask
me.

Huh! What if they do have to ask you? Let em! Then when they see that
youre a regular feller theyll ask you next time without having to.

But I wonder if I am.

Am what? asked Jimmy ungrammatically.

A regular feller. Maybe Im not. I wonder

Jimmy threw up his hands in despair. Oh, gee, hes at it again!
Dud, what you want to do is stop wondering. Youre the finest little
wonderer that ever came down the pike, all right, but you spend so much
time at it that you dont get anywhere. Now, you take my advice, old
chap, and stop wondering whether fellows like you or dont like you.
Just get out and butt in a little. When you see a crowd walk right into
the middle of it and find out whether its a fight or a frolic. And,
whatever it is, take a hand. Now theres some mighty good advice, Dud,
take it from me. I didnt know I had it in me! And let me tell you
another thing, kid. If you expect to have a show for the first team you
want to crawl out of your shell and rub shoulders with fellows. Get
hunky with the first team crowd, do you see? Bebe more of awell,
more of a regular feller, like I said before. Dont try too hard to
be popular, though. Fellows get onto that and wont stand for it.
Justjust be natural!

I guess Im being natural, answered Dud, with a smile, and that
is where the trouble is. I guess Ill have to wait until next year.
A lower middle fellow feels sort of fresh if he tries to mix in with
upper middlers.

Piffle! Lots of your class are thick as thieves with upper middle
chaps. Look at young WhatshisnameStiles. Hes always traveling with
upper middlersOrdway and Blake and that bunch.

Ned Stiles has more cheek than I have. Besides, I dont think fellows
like him particularly, Jimmy. He sort of toadies, doesnt he?

Hes a perfect ass, if you ask me. But they seem to stand for him.

Well, but I dont want to be stood for; I want fellows toto want
me.

All right. Give em a chance then. Youre all right, Dud, only
youre shy. Thats whats the matter with you, old chap, youre just
plain shy! Never thought of it before. Look here, now, Ill tell you
what you do. You forget all about your dear little self and get over
beingbeinggee, whats the word I want? Being self-conscious! Thats
it! Thats your trouble, self-consciousness. Jimmy beamed approval at
himself. Best way to do it is toto do it! Tell you what, well make
a start tonight, eh? Lets go out and visit someone. Who do you know
that youd like to know better?

Id like to know Hugh Ordway, for one, said Dud hesitatingly. But I
guess he wouldnt care about knowing me, and so

Stow it! Thats just what you mustnt do, do you see? You mustnt
wonder whether a fellow wants to know you or not. You just take
it for granted that he does. Say to yourself, Im a good feller, a
regular feller. Im as good as you are. Of course you want to know me.
Why not? See the idea?

Dud nodded doubtfully. Still, Hugh Ordways a bit

A bit what? demanded Jimmy impatiently.

I mean hes awfully popular and has piles of friends and he wouldnt
be likely toto want to know me.

Oh, piffle! Ordways just like any of usexcept that he happens to be
English and have a Lord or a Duke or something for a father. I dont
know him very well myself, but thats just because he trains with the
football crowdBlake and Winslow and that bunch. But I know him plenty
well enough to visit, and thats just what well do this evening, Dud.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Jimmy and Dud are discussing Dud's shyness and how it prevents him from mixing with other people. Jimmy tells Dud that he needs to stop wondering whether people like him or not, and just get out there and mix. He also advises Dud to be more of a "regular feller" and not try too hard to be popular.
Later, they decide to visit Hugh Ordway, an upper middle class student whom Dud admires. Jimmy reassures Dud that Ordway is just like any other person, except that he happens to be English and come from a wealthy family.
They go to Ordway's room and find him studying. They strike up a conversation, and Ordway seems interested in getting to know Dud better. They exchange stories about their families and interests, and Ordway invites Dud to come visit him in England during the summer. Dud is thrilled, and the two of them become friends.
