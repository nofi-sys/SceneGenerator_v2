SCENE:
The sun was setting when he drove off in a caleche for the de Leyva
house at Medinas. On his way, he saw scenes between parties of Reds and
Whites which made him wonder at the strength of the feelings between
them. Killing Chavez and claiming to be God did not rouse this, he
thought. This hate has been simmering for years; this is only the
boiling over.

At the West Gate, a Red patrol was stopping the traffic for examination
before permitting it to pass; its officer turned back a carriage which
had been trundling in front of Hi for some minutes. He then came forward
to question Hi, found that he was English and allowed him to proceed. He
did this, as Hi thought, grudgingly, in a way which made him wonder,
whether the English were as much loved as his father had always said.

Beyond the gate, the Anselmo road was a narrow street from which narrow
courts opened. Street and courts swarmed with people, all talking at the
tops of their voices, but above all the talking the harsh bellow of
public orators in praise of violence sounded. The place stank of mice,
sweat, fried fish and damp washing. Hi called to the driver: Is this
Medinas?

Medinas, si, the driver said.

Little boys clambered on to the caleche, asking for Frencha penny.
Ingles penny. A fat, pale-faced young man hopped on to the step and
poised there while he made his proposals.

You want to see the sights? he said. I be your guide. I show you very
funny sights. I show you not the usual sort of thing. You like a nice
cock-fight, no? You like a quail-fight, no? See now, I take you to a
special thing, not many knows about, a good dog-fight. There now, only
three dollar. Well, I take you to a special thing to-night; something
you never see, perhaps ever again. No? Well, you go to dam
prayer-meeting, see? dam prayer-meeting.

He swung off to seek for a client elsewhere. The caleche passed from the
narrows into a broader space, went under an old archway of withering red
and yellow plaster and came out into an avenue of palms lit by electric
light. Turning from this through an ilex grove it stopped at the de
Leyva palace.

Hi was admitted into a great cool hall built of white Otorin marble. All
round it and against its columns were the stands of the de Leyva armour,
some of which had marched in the Conquest. Carlotta joined him almost at
once; he gave her the letter.

I thought that perhaps you would bring a letter, she said. I suppose
Rosa wants me to go back to her? My brother is against that.

I hope, Hi said, I do hope that Don Manuel will not be attacked by
these Reds.

He is far away by this time.

Hi felt that he had said a tactless thing, even to suggest that Don
Manuel might be attacked, so he added:

I should pity the man who attacked Don Manuel.

It is nice of you to say that, Hi, she said.

Did he see the proclamation, or hear of the murder, before he started?
Hi asked.

No. Rosa tells me that his captive, the Hinestrosa, has been rescued.

Yes.

What do you think of my country?

Its produced you and Don Manuel and Donna Emilia, he said. I think
its a marvellous country.

It may be marvellous, if it turn now.

It will turn, he said. No nation will stand that proclamation.

If a nation be only mad enough, it will stand anything, she said.

I hope, Hi said, that Don Manuel will find his mother better, when he
gets there.

I fear that there is little hope of that, she said. A telegram came
here . . . he can hardly see his mother alive again.

I am sorry to hear that.

Others are not so sorry, she said, in a strange voice. He looked at
her with a rush of understanding that she was standing alone, through
her love of Don Manuel.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The tone of this scene is one of suspense and foreboding. The point of view is third person limited, and the focus is on Hi's thoughts and impressions. The setting is a poor, crowded neighborhood in Medina, and the atmosphere is one of tension and danger.
