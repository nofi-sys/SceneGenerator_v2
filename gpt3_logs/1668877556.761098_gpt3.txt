SCENE:
L

A MIRACLE


TIS a miracle! Tis nothing but a miracle! cried Father Maloney, for
perhaps the fiftieth time.

He stared at the yellow parchment upon the table in front of him. It
was real, it was tangible. He could touch it, finger it, even read the
crabbed writing upon it; and yet, for the life of him, he could hardly
bring his brain to believe that he was not dreaming.

To think, he ejaculated, that it has lain there under our very
noses, so to speak, and us wondering and worrying all these weeks.
Well, well!

Lady Mary looked silently at the yellow parchment. Words, so far, had
failed her. The bigness of the thing, gripping her, had held her silent.

Tis plain enough what the old Sir Antony was up to, when Henry came
upon him, the scoundrel, said Father Maloney. And the secret kept all
these years! Tis a miracle has brought it to light now.

Lady Mary raised her head.

And perhaps too late, she said quietly, voicing the fear at her
heart; a fear which, with the last hour, had been waxing stronger.

Too late! cried Father Maloney cheerily, not a bit of it. If its
two miracles is needed, God will be working them; though Im thinking
therell be no miracle in bringing the boy home. Hes hiding safe
enough somewhere, and will be found before sun-down, Ill be bound.

Perhaps, said Lady Mary very low, and unheeding his words, I didnt
give up everything whole-heartedly. Perhaps I still held to it in my
mind. If I did, it was for him, and not for myself. And now he is gone.

Rubbish, said Father Maloney.

Is it? asked Lady Mary.

Father Maloney put his hands upon the table and looked across at her.

Werent you doing your best to accept Gods will in the matter? he
demanded.

Lady Mary smiled faintly.

I believe so, she said.

Then if you did your best, you may be sure God took it as such, and
wasnt holding you to account for any little weakness which was but
part and parcel of human nature. Im thinking He knows the human side
of us well enough, and doesnt look at it too closely when were trying
to do His will. Hell not have been taking a trifle of fretting into
consideration, when your heart was set the right way. You neednt be
thinking He was waiting to pounce down and punish you because you
didnt throw the Castle over to that young fella with devil a bit may
care in your heart. Sure, its giving Him the things the human side
of us is fretting after that counts. Dont you go fearing God likes
punishing people. Wheres your faith at all?

But supposing-- began Lady Mary.

Im not supposing at all, broke in Father Maloney. The childs safe
enough. And if he isnt--though surely tis in my heart he is--tis no
punishment to you. Glory be to God! Who do you think loves him best,
our Blessed Lord, or you? I tell you hes as safe in His keeping,
storm or no storm, as if he was in his bed this very minute with you
on one side of him, and Biddy on the other. Tis all for talking about
the Love of Christ we are, and when it comes to the test, its precious
little believing we show. And Im as bad as any of ye.

Then you are anxious, said Lady Mary quietly.

Father Maloney blew his nose.

Anxious! of course Im anxious, he said half-testily. Who wouldnt
be anxious with a bit of a boy out in the weather weve had. Tis
against all sense I shouldnt be anxious. But hell come home right
enough, he ended obstinately.

And then suddenly the cloak of quiet dignity, the gentle control, fell
from Lady Mary.

Oh, Father, she cried, go on saying that. Say it again and again.
I dont mind how often you say it. Somehow, her lips were trembling
piteously, it makes it seem true.

Father Maloney speculates that the old Sir Antony was up to something when Henry found him. He also believes that the boy (referring to Lady Mary's son) will be found before sundown. Lady Mary is afraid that it may be too late. Father Maloney reassures her that if it is two miracles that are needed, God will work them.
