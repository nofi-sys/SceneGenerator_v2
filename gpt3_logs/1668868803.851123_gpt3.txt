SCENE:
Is anyone coming here this afternoon? Rosa asked. No one, so far as I
can tell, her mother answered. I am not asking people, because I want
you to see Carlotta while you can. Besides, it is Lent; one should be
quiet in Lent.

They are putting placards in the road, Rosa said. We could not read
them; but they seemed to be about quiet at Easter.

I am glad, Donna Emilia said. The last exhibition of disorder
disgraced our country.

The old butler entered. Seora, he said, Don Inocencio desires to
speak with you, if it be your pleasure.

Let him come in, she answered. Don Inocencio, Highworth, is one of
the Senators of the White party, to which we belong. He was an old
friend of my husbands.

Shall I not go? Hi asked.

No, stay, its very good for you, Rosa said.

Don Inocencio was a little pale man with a habit of inflating his
cheeks; when he did this, he looked more important than at other times.
He held a roll of paper in his left hand; he had very nice manners and
spoke in English on finding Hi there. He was in a state of some
agitation.

My dear lady, he said, I have come all this way, in a great hurry,
because of the importance of the occasion. The man has been permitted
and permitted till he has presumed and presumed; but now he has
outstepped all bounds; he has, if I may say so, without inelegance,
burst, like the frog in the fable.

Who has burst without inelegance? Rosa asked. Do tell us. Could he do
it again, publicly?

He has done it publicly, Don Inocencio said, It cannot be done twice
in a civilised country.

Who is this? Donna Emilia asked. I do not quite understand? Has there
been some accident?

I thought that at first, Don Inocencio answered. I thought at first,
this is not genuine; this is a ruse or trick, designed by an enemy. It
would be a skilled thrust, though that of a devil, to lead people to
suppose that this came from our enemy. Then I thought, no, this thing is
too mad to be anything but genuine; no counterfeit would be so crazy.

But what is it, Don Inocencio?

Have you not read the proclamation?

A proclamation; which; what proclamation?

There is at present only one, which will be historical. This is it,
this scroll. They started to put this upon the walls at the time of the
siesta; it is now everywhere; can it be that you have not seen it?

No; no, indeed.

Then I am a bringer of news. When I read it, I thought, this, if
genuine, will be a landmark in our story. I must have copies of this; so
must Donna Emilia; therefore I procured copies from the bill-stickers.

You know that I am a collector of documents, which will go to my
nephew; all things, especially documents, if old enough, have romance;
this will have much more than romance, being the cause, if I am not much
mistaken, of great events in the near future. We live in stirring times,
Miss Rosa. You, Mr. Ridden, will see great events, really great events,
as the Blanco party reasserts its ideals. Wait, now; for this big
document; I will display my wares upon this chair.

He pulled a chair towards him so that he could spread the paper upon the
back: it was a yellow paper, printed in blunt, black type with a tall
red heading:

PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

He glanced at the faces of his audience for some expression, which he
did not find.

What, he said, no comment?

None, Rosa said. Mother and I cannot read well without our glasses.

And I, Hi said, cannot read Spanish very fluently yet. In fact, I can
only get as far as Government.

Perhaps, Inocencio, Donna Emilia said, you will be so kind as to read
it for us.
