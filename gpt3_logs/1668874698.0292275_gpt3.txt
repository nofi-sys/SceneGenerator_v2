Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
I dont know about that, either. A semi-detached villa in the suburbs,
among a family of children compared to whom the Mainwarings are angels,
is not the place one would choose for a holiday.

You have a lot of young brothers and sisters, then?

Oh, no, I have none! I am an orphan; so I have to spend my spare time
with an aunt who doesnt particularly want me.

That is hard lines. Then you will teach again?

Yes, if I can get any pupils, said she, rather sadly, thinking how
much the shortness of her stay at the Vicarage would be against her
chances of getting another engagement. Not like this, though! I
shall take lodgings in London and try to get daily pupils, for music,
perhaps. Then I shall have more time to myself, and I can study better.

But you know enough already; and you will be frightfully dull if you
live by yourself.

Not so dull as I am here. And, when I have got on with music and other
things, I shall take another resident engagement--abroad this time. I
think I should like to go to Russia or Canada.

Have you many friends in London?

No. I had some once, before papa died. But one falls out of the way of
ones friends somehow when one gets very poor. It isnt their fault,
and it doesnt seem to be ones own; but it always happens.

I want you to promise me something, said George, in a low voice.

She looked up inquiringly.

I want you to promise to give me your address in London if you settle
there by yourself.

Miss Lane hesitated. She was very much touched by his sympathy, very
anxious not to lose it by offending him; but she did not think his
request was one which she could or ought to grant. Independence had
made her careful.

I have not the least idea where I shall be, or if I shall be able to
carry out my plan at all, said she, evasively.

Where there is a will there is a way, you know; and I should think
that is more the case with you than with most people.

You are laughing at me. You think me too strong-minded.

I will tell you what I think of you when you have answered me. Now
will you promise?

I dont see of what use knowing my address would be to you, because as
I shall be living quite alone, I cant ever see any one.

That doesnt follow. Do you mean that you would live the life of a
hermit, and condemn yourself to solitary confinement of your own free
will?

For a time. There is no help for it.

Yes, there is. We are going up to town, some of us, before long. I
will ask my mother and Lilian to call on you. But I must know your
address. And I could send you tickets for concerts and things, where
you could go with your pupils, if you wouldnt let any one accompany
you who would enjoy it more. Would you let me take you to a concert?
he said, bending lower.

Miss Lane looked nervously down, then entreatingly up.

I couldnt, she said, in a low voice.

He saw the pleading reluctance in her eyes, and pressed his advantage.

You do not know how unhappy it makes me to think of your sacrificing
your bright life alone in a dingy London lodging. However nice your
pupils and their friends may be to you, their affection or--or
esteem--can never be so strong as that of your own disinterested
friends.

He knew how to throw into these words a feeling and warmth which made
the girls cheeks flush. There was a pause.

You do believe in my friendship, do you not? he asked, more softly
still.

Of course I do, answered the girl, looking up with an effort.
I--I--am sure you mean to be very kind, Mr. Braithwaite.
