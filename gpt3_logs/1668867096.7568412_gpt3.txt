SCENE:
Peter? she asked, trembling.

Yes, Mother, Peter. I called him a spy and he tried to knife me.

Oh, my son! she cried. You did not know. It is my fault, I should
have told you. Now he will fight no more in the dark; but will come out
in the open, and when he does that I am lost.

What do you mean? I asked.

I do not mind dying, she said; but they will take your father first,
because of me.

What do you mean?I can understand nothing of what you are driving
at.

Then listen, she said. Peter wants me. That is the reason he is
spying on your father. If he can prove something on him, and Father is
taken to the mines or killed, Peter will claim me.

How do you know this? I asked.

Peter himself has told me that he wants me. He tried to make me leave
your dear father and go with him, and when I refused he bragged that he
was in the favor of the Kalkars and that he would get me in the end. He
has tried to buy my honor with your fathers life. That is why I have
been so afraid and so unhappy; but I knew that you and Father would
rather die than have me do that thing and so I have withstood him.

Did you tell Father? I asked.

I dared not. He would have killed Peter and that would have been the
end of us, for Peter stands high in the graces of the authorities.

I will kill him, I said.

She tried to dissuade me, and finally I had to promise her that I would
wait until I had provocation that the authorities might recognizeGod
knows I had provocation enough, though.

After breakfast the next day we set out singly and in different
directions, as was always our custom on the first Sunday in each month.
I went to Jims first to get Juana, as she did not know the way, having
never been with us. I found her ready and waiting and alone, as Jim and
Mollie had started a few minutes before, and she was seemingly very glad
to see me.

I told her nothing of Peter, as there is enough trouble in the world
without burdening people with any that does not directly threaten
themeach has plenty of his own. I led her up the river for a mile and
all the while we watched to see if we were followed. Then we found a
skiff, where I had hidden it, and crossed the river, and after hiding it
again we continued on up for a half a mile. Here was a raft that I had
made myself and on this we poled to the opposite shore; if any followed
us they must have swum, for there were no other boats on this part of
the river.

A mile west of the river is a thick forest of very old trees, and toward
this I led Juana. At its verge we sat down, ostensibly to rest; but
really to see if anyone was near who might have followed us or who could
accidentally discover our next move. There was no one in sight and so
with light hearts we arose and entered the forest.

For a quarter of a mile we made our way along a winding path and then I
turned to the left at a right angle, and entered thick brush where there
was no trail. Always we did this, never covering the last quarter of a
mile over the same route, lest we make a path that might be marked and
followed.

Presently we came to a pile of brush wood beneath one edge of which was
an opening into which, by stooping low, one might enter. It was screened
from view by a fallen tree over which had been heaped broken branches.
Even in winter time and early spring the opening in the brush beyond was
invisible to the passers-by, if there had been any passers-by, which
except upon rare occasions there were not. A man trailing lost stock
might come this way; but no others, for it was a lonely and unfrequented
spot. During the summer, the season of the year when there was the
greatest danger of discovery, the entire brush pile and its tangled
screen were hidden completely beneath a mass of wild vines, so that it
was with difficulty that we found it.

Into this opening I led Juanataking her by the hand as one might a
blind person, although it was not so dark within that she could not see
perfectly every step she took. However, I took her by the hand, a poor
excuse being better than none. The winding tunnel beneath the brush was
a hundred yards long, perhapsI wished then that it had been a hundred
milesit ended abruptly before a rough stone wall in which was a heavy
door. Its oaken panels were black with age and streaked with green from
the massive hinges that ran across its entire width in three places,
while from the great lag screws that fastened them to the door, brownish
streaks of rust ran down to mingle with the green and the black. In
patches, moss grew upon it, so that all-in-all it had the appearance of
great antiquity, though even the oldest among those who knew of it at
all could only guess at its ageit had been there longer than they
could recall. Above the door, carved in the stone, was a shepherds
crook and the words, _Dieu et mon droit_.
