SCENE:
XXII


JEAN, said Madame Torialli, one evening late in June. Are you in a
hurry to-night?

Not if I can stay with you, Madame?

Madame Torialli smiled at him; her eyes seemed almost too innocent for
maternity, and yet it was maternity that she loved best to express for
Jean.

I sometimes fear that we work you too hard, she said wistfully. I am
a vampire for my husband, I sacrifice so many to save him and serve him
all I can; and in the end I often ask myself what is it that I do for
him? Nothing! A woman is very helpless, Monsieur Jean.

Jean might have pointed out that she wasnt really very helpless when
she had at least half a dozen men at her bidding from morning to night.
But he felt a profound pity for Madame Torialli. He often thought
Torialli did not understand her, and he knew that he was not worthy of
her; only what man could be that? So he said:

If I could help you the least little bit in the world it would make me
very happy, Madame!

You do help me, said Madame, slowly. She turned with him into the
bronze room and sank on a low couch near the window. It was wide open,
and summer came in through it--the soft, fresh breeze of the early
summer when the earth has not yet grown sober with her riches, but
sings to herself in her joy, and her songs bring all the fragrance of
the fields. Even in Paris the scent of new-born flowers was in the air.
The sounds from the street seemed far away; it was a still night, and
the soft, green curtains hardly moved behind Madames golden head.

Let us talk together for a little, she said.

Jean sat down near her; he did not speak at once. It seemed to Jean
that he did not need to speak much to her--she read his heart as if it
were an open book, and he liked best to keep quite still near her, and
hold it open for her to read.

Just lately, the last few days, you have not been very happy, said
Madame gently at last. I have felt it, you know, and I have said to
myself, It has not come to him as quickly as he had hoped--his great
future! I have said to my husband, That boy with us, we are perhaps
using him too much? Torialli has laughed at me; his own success took
long in coming, and he worked for it through long, dry, fruitless
years. To him it seems that you are doing very well and getting
on very fast. But for me--my blood runs quickly for you--I have an
impatience, I want you so much to succeed.

When you talk like this, said Jean, and his voice was not very
steady, you give me something sweeter than success, Madame.

She was silent for a moment.

But I would give you success too, she said. It was Jeans turn to be
silent, but he was silent because he dared not speak.

Our good Louis, Madame continued, when she thought the pause had
lasted long enough, has an affection for you almost like that of a
brother. We speak sometimes of your future, he and I. You have done
wonders for him since you have been here, you have taken half his work
off his shoulders; but have you--I sometimes ask myself--taken too
much?

I like hard work, said Jean quickly. I should not complain if it
were even harder than it is.

And you would do much willingly for a friend? Madame asked, playing
with a large paper-cutter on a table beside her. I am quite sure of
that.

I would do anything in the world for you, Madame, said Jean.

I was talking of Louis, said Madame.

Jean was silent. Madames little hands still played with the
paper-cutter; they looked such helpless little hands, Jean longed
to take them in one of his and take care of them always. He did not
believe that any one could ever take care of Madame Torialli enough. If
he had known it, his feeling for her was very much the same as Margots
feelings for himself; for men can have the maternal instinct as well as
women; and quite as uselessly.

Poor Louis! said Madame softly. He is often misunderstood, I
think. His parents had good blood in them, but his mother died young,
and his father fell quickly into a bad type of existence. Louis has
been brought up by chance; he has the instincts of his class, but I
sometimes fear his manners--


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is very formal and polite. Jean is very deferential to Madame Torialli, and she speaks to him in a very motherly way. There is a sense of intimacy between them, but it is not a romantic or sexual intimacy.
