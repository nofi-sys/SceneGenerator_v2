Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Yes, she said, withdrawing with an offended air from his encircling
arm, you can say these things to me now, but ever since that night at
Belfield, when you never took your eyes off Sylvia Shapleigh, you have
been thinking a great deal too much about her.

Elizabeth, said Blair solemnly, you are a fool, and then he
suddenly burst out laughing--a genuine laugh, inspired by the perfect
absurdity of the thing.

And you wont deny it? asked Elizabeth, trying feebly to maintain her
position.

Of course not, answered Blair, becoming serious. If you were a man
I should knock you down. As you are a woman, I cant, but I decline
to take any notice of what you say. This is the seventeenth girl, I
believe, that you have accused me of making eyes at.

Elizabeth condescended to smile at this, and harmony was in a fair way
to be restored between them. But after a moment Elizabeth said:

There is something else, though, which troubled me that night. It was
at the dinner table.

Blair knew in an instant that she meant his increased subscription to
the Jockey Club, but he asked what she meant.

Can you ask me? replied Elizabeth.

The devil I can, cried Blair, dropping at once into the ordinary,
every-day, vexed-husbands tone. Look here, Elizabeth, didnt you
encourage me?

What could I do, answered his wife with a piteous smile, with
Richard Skelton looking on and pitying me?

And what could _I_ do, with Skelton challenging me in every tone of
his voice and look of his eye? Dont I know that Miles Lightfoot has
got his orders to ruin me at any cost? And do you think that a man
would quietly draw out and yield the field to another man under the
circumstances? No, Elizabeth, I beat Skelton in the race for you, and
Ill beat him again on the Campdown course. And it isnt so hard as
you think. You know that black colt Alabaster, of old Tom Shapleighs?
Well, that colt is more than three fourths thoroughbred--he has a
strain of blood in him that goes straight back to Diomed. Now, that
three fourths thoroughbred can beat any thoroughbred in Skeltons
stable; and Skelton himself said so in effect the night of that
confounded dinner, and Im going to have that horse. I shall have him
with this money that you have enabled me to raise, and which I regard
as a gift from you.

Blair kissed her again--he certainly knew how to express his thanks.
Elizabeth had heard the story about Alabaster and Diomed before.

But I thought you said Mr. Shapleigh wouldnt sell him?

He _shall_ sell him, by George! cried Blair violently, and bringing
his fist down on the mantel. Elizabeth, you cant imagine how the
desire to own that horse has taken possession of me. You make yourself
jealous about a lot of pink-faced girls that I never looked at twice,
and, if you only knew it, your real rival is Alabaster. I swear I am
in love with that horse! I dream about him at night. I never saw such
quarters in my life--so strong, so sinewy, yet so light! And in the
daytime, as I ride by the pasture and see him roaming around, not half
attended to, it maddens me that such a creature should not be more
appreciated. If I had him I could pay off all the mortgages on this
place. I could send Hilary to school, and have a governess for Mary.
I could give you a new carriage, and, better than all, I could beat
Skelton at his own game.

He spoke with a strange fierceness, he so debonair and full of
careless good humor. Elizabeth looked at him in amazement. In all their
fifteen years of married life she had never seen this trait in him.
He was so intense, so wrought up over the horse, that she was glad it
was only a horse that excited him. Suppose it had been one of those
pink-faced girls that Blair spoke of so contemptuously, but who liked
his dashing manners and captivating ways only too well, Mrs. Blair
thought.

But suppose, for an instant, Mr. Shapleigh wont sell him, persisted
Elizabeth.

But he _shall_ sell him! shouted Blair for the second time. What
does he want with him--to drive him to old lady Shapleighs chaise?
I assure you he talks about Sylvias wanting to keep the horse as a
riding horse. It made me grind my teeth. It would be cruel--yes, cruel,
Elizabeth, if I didnt own that horse!

Elizabeth was startled; she said nothing more about Alabaster, and
Blair went off with his hands in his pockets toward Belfield, and in
a little while she saw him leaning on the fence that divided the two
places, as the lands came together at the river, eying the black horse
that browsed about in the pasture in the late October afternoon.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Blair and Elizabeth have been married for 15 years and live on a farm. Blair is obsessed with a black horse named Alabaster that belongs to their neighbor, Tom Shapleigh. Blair is convinced that Alabaster is a better horse than any of the thoroughbreds in the stable of their rival, Richard Skelton.
 Elizabeth tries to dissuade Blair from fixating on the horse, reminding him that they can't afford to buy it and that Mr. Shapleigh has no intention of selling it. Blair is undeterred, however, and tells Elizabeth that he is determined to own the horse. He is so obsessed with it that he has been dreaming about it at night.
Blair goes to talk to Mr. Shapleigh, who is initially resistant to selling the horse. However, Blair is able to convince him to sell Alabaster by offering to pay off all of the mortgages on the Shapleigh farm.
