SCENE:
"And we--those of us who can run," retorted Lovat, "are like rats
without a hole.  There are occasions, Mr. Stuart, when even rats can
face the cat--and rout him too."

"The Prince has ordered us to disperse," bleated Murray in a flutter
of nerves and tepid anger.

"The Prince," barked Lovat, "gave his last order on Culloden Moor.
We are done with princes and Irishmen and grand French promises; we
are men with everything to lose and something to gain.  Maybe your
profession, Mr. Murray, or is it your Lowland blood, has made you
unacquainted with the lengths that despair may drive a man."

"You are pleased to sneer, sir," blurted out Murray.

"I trust," replied Lovat, in a melancholy undertone, "you may never
have a chance to repay the compliment."

"Come, come," broke in Lochiel, "this is no time for contentions.  If
it is decided that we shall raise the clans we must make speed.  I
take it that we are of one mind upon that?"

Lovat nodded his head before any could speak.

"Could we but raise a few thousand men," he said, "and we shall show
the Duke what Highland warfare may mean.  Let us meet again in ten
days' time each with his people.  Send out the summons, Lochiel.  Let
the Prince take ship to France if he will--so long as we do not
betray each other" (and here he looked hard at Murray) "we are as
safe as wild-cats in Argyll."

There was a loud murmur of approval from those about him.  Now, as
always, Lovat had carried the day.  He had come, an old sick man,
coughing in his litter, facing a dozen men fairly eaten up with fear
and perplexity.  In one short hour he had them at his heel.  With a
body as sound as his mind he would have raised the Highlands himself.

Still Murray of Broughton, that creaking door, must have his word.
It was more his habit of mind than any real evil in the man.  He was
the soul of method, and concise as the Lord President himself.
Perhaps he suspected Lovat, as Lovat in all sincerity suspected him.
Perhaps he was influenced by such reason as he possessed.  It may be
that he foresaw what was ordained, and knew Lovat for what he was.

"My lord," he said in his hesitating voice, "I have little influence
here--I have no people to consider--I am not a soldier, only a man of
business who has tried to serve the cause."

They waited while Lovat watched him as a snake watches a rabbit.

"Supposing, my lord, that the clans are persuaded to rise again, what
kind of campaign can you carry on?  Where can you obtain your
supplies, your ammunition, or money to pay our troops?  Already the
coast is patrolled--the Highlands surrounded and the roads to the
south cut off--what kind of mercy will the isolated places
receive--the very places where you hope to obtain provisions?  They
will so harry the country, my lord, to starve you out that the very
sight of women and children coming to you in the direst starvation
will make you regret this step.  It is starvation, and not defeat,
will give you your answer, my lord."

"There's truth in what he says," murmured a man behind Lochiel.

"Mr. Murray," said Lovat, "I doubt not you speak with sincerity, but
this is a matter on which we must take our own counsel.  Look to your
own safety, Mr. Murray, and no gentleman here will say you acted
unbecomingly."

It had become a contest between these two--Lovat forcing the pace to
save his neck, and Murray, knowing what was behind it all,
struggling, who can say why, to dissuade them from further bloodshed.

He moistened his lips and played his last card.

"As you will, gentlemen," he said suavely, "It is for you to decide.
But as a man of business, since your lordship has discounted any
finer qualities in me, might I suggest that perhaps a memorandum of
this meeting, a pledge to bind us together, would give adhesion to
such a proposal.  It is only natural, and in desperate straits where
all must live or fall together, a prudent course to take."

Lovat gripped the edge of the table with his hands.  This was a blow
indeed.  His face changed colour.  He seemed for a moment to quiver
as though he were icy cold, his head commencing to shake from side to
side.

"I agree to that entirely," said Lochiel.

"No, no," came from Lovat in a whisper.
