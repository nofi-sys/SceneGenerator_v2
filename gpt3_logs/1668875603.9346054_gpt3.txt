SCENE:
But yes. Most certainly! I shall be charmed. With a smile and a nod
she was gone.

The most of the voyage--or as much of it as the proprieties and the
Baroness Ostersacken would permit--Topham spent by Miss Ferreiras
side. Day after day the two watched the shadows shorten, vanish, and
grow long once more. Night after night they saw the moon sail across
the star-dusted sky, and watched the ripples break athwart her silvery
reflection in the water. Day after day, night after night they grew
into each others thoughts--while the Baroness Ostersacken played
propriety in the background.

By the end of the voyage each had learned much about the other. Topham
had learned that the girl was the daughter of a German mother and a
Brazilian father and that she was returning from a trip to Rio Janiero,
made in charge of her cousin the Baroness, to join her brother at
Berlin. She, on the other hand, learned that Topham was a navy officer,
en route for Tokio, who was going via Berlin to see an old friend,
and would thence go to Brindisi to join his ship. Not a word nor a
suggestion from either had reference to any papers he might carry.

Long before the end of the voyage Topham had made up his mind that
this was the one girl in the world for him. His earlier affection for
Lillian Byrd he had absolutely forgotten or remembered only to wonder
that he should ever have mistaken it for real love. It was a very milk
and water feeling contrasted with the madness that possessed him now.

Yet what to do? His orders were imperative and he must obey them to the
last jot and tittle. Nothing must be allowed to prevent his reaching
Berlin and delivering his packet to Rutile; nothing must be allowed to
prevent him from reporting on board the Nevada at Brindisi four days
later; and nothing must prevent him from reaching Japan and trying to
get the information his government desired.

For the first time in his life the collar galled. Oh! to be free to
take this woman in his arms and tell her that he loved her. He believed
that he would not do so in vain. But he knew, none better, that he had
no right to speak while bound for the antipodes. And if he could not
speak he had no right to hint nor suggest nor attempt, however vaguely,
to bind the girls fancy.

For another reason he was not free. His mysterious illness had not
recurred, but neither had it been explained. Several times he had seen
and twice he had spoken with his Spanish-American acquaintance, (whose
name turned out to be Sebastian Gomez), but he had been able to find
out nothing suspicious about him. And even if he had been convinced of
the mans guilt, he was still absolutely without reason to suspect Miss
Ferreira of any complicity in it. Almost he had made up his mind that
his illness had really been accidental. If his own interests alone had
been concerned he would have dismissed the incident from his mind.

But not only his own interests were involved. His country had trusted
him to carry a message safely to Berlin and he had no right to take
any chance nor to neglect any precaution nor to disregard any threat,
however slight, that might endanger his carrying out its behests.
Until that packet was in Rutiles hands, he must not involve himself
with anyone--least of all with anyone on whom even the suggestion of
suspicion could fall.

So he kept silent, even on the last evening of the voyage--even when
he saw the sun rise beyond the distant line that marked Germany and
the port of Cuxhaven, at the mouth of the Elbe, where he must leave
the ship and finish his journey to Berlin by rail, to the destruction
of all chance for further familiar intercourse. He had resolved on his
course and he would stick to it at whatever cost. He would part from
the girl without a word of love and discharge his duty to the last
iota. Then--then he would get leave or resign if need be and come back
to seek her. It was cold comfort to hope that he might find her still
free, but it was all he had.

Rapidly Cuxhaven swelled in the perspective, and soon the steamer
drew alongside the dock. As Topham watched the welcoming crowd,
Miss Ferreira, standing by his side, gave a cry and began to wave
her handkerchief. See, senor! she exclaimed. My brother! Yonder!
Herrman! Herrman! she called.

A patch of white fluttered in the hands of a man on the pier; and the
owner pressed forward, eager to get on board. Soon Topham saw him
coming up the plank.

The navy officer drew aside to let sister and brother meet without
intrusion. Later, Miss Ferreira called him and he stepped forward to be
introduced.

Ferreira was very like his sister, but was tall and strong, almost
as tall and strong, Topham judged, as he himself. He clasped the
Americans hand warmly.

I am delighted to meet you, senor, he cried. My sister tells me how
much you have done to make her crossing pleasant. Do you go directly to
Berlin, senor?
