SCENE:
What a ghastly business! ejaculated John, as Father Maloney stopped.

You may well say that, remarked Father Maloney. The matter was plain
enough. Henry had shot his brother with the idea of getting hold of
that precious paper unhindered, but he had forgotten--or, maybe, never
realized--the presence of Sir Antonys wolf-hound, Gelert. The dog
wasnt one to let his masters murderer go unpunished.

Again there was a little pause. Father Maloney refilled his pipe.

Well, he said after a minute, after Sir Antonys death, his son
Antony came into possession. But-- Father Maloney emphasized the word
with an emphatic movement of his pipe, that paper desired by Henry had
vanished. Wherever Sir Antony had hidden it, the hiding-place was a bit
too good. It has never been found.

Perhaps, suggested John tentatively, Henry had destroyed it.

Father Maloney shook his head.

Not a bit of it. If Henry had destroyed it before he shot his brother
thered have been no need for the shooting at all. He shot his brother
to get at the paper, but Gelert was one too many for him. And never a
scrap of paper was found upon, or near him.

And, said John ruminatively, that has proved an awkward business.

It has that, said Father Maloney drily. A claimant has turned up.

Yes, said John quietly.

Oh, tis a pretty boggle, went on Father Maloney, it is that. This
fella, this David Delancey arrives from Africa----

Africa! interrupted John. I heard he was an American?

Well, tis Africa he has come from, said Father Maloney. He arrives
as cool as a cucumber. Im the rightful owner of this place, says he
in a letter to Lady Mary. Ive every proof, and send copies of them.
Tis a long rigmarole how he got hold of them. Of course there was
a lawyers investigation. Thats been going on for months. But tis
proved now beyond no manner of doubt that he is the direct descendant
of that scoundrel Henry, and not a scrap of legal proof have we got on
our side that Henry ever renounced the claim to the property. Theres
the whole business. Lady Mary got the letter from the lawyer fellas
this morning. Tis full of their jargon, but the meaning is plain
enough through it all. David Delancey is the rightful heir, and no
vestige of right has this little Antony here to stick or stone of the
old place.

Father Maloney stopped.

Its--its preposterous! ejaculated John hotly.

Father Maloney smiled, an untranslatable, an enigmatic smile.

When does he take possession? demanded John.

Oh, hes written a decent enough letter, responded Father Maloney.
He says there can be time enough taken for the handing over of the
property. Take six months, or a year about it, for that matter, says
he. Hell be coming down here in a day or so to the inn to look around
and get the hang of affairs, though hes in no way anxious to intrude.

Intrude! snorted the wrathful John.

Well, well, interpolated Father Maloney soothingly, hell be within
his rights according to those lawyer fellas.

John gazed sternly before him.

I dont believe he has an atom of right, he announced emphatically.

Again Father Maloney smiled.

Well, Ill allow were all of us for that way of thinking ourselves.
But private opinion has never overridden the law yet, without proof in
the plainest black and white to back it up.

John heaved a portentous sigh.

Here, at least, was fact indisputable. Matters for the present
inhabitants of Delancey Castle were at a deadlock, a deadlock of the
tightest and most emphatic kind. There was no denying that a stoic
philosophy was the only course open to them.

But stoic philosophy on such a matter! How was any living human
creature possessed of a drop of warm tingling blood in his veins to
encompass such a state of being? He saw the trio as they had come
towards him in the August sunshine that morning,--the girl tall,
graceful, breathing vitality, temperament; the merest casual observer
must have felt her extraordinary capacity for feeling things intensely.
Oh, it was no imagination on his part, imagination fed by the white
light of idealism with which he had surrounded her. Verily was there no
imagination on his part. She would suffer in every fibre of her being.
It would be to her like tearing her heart from her. And she would
suffer smiling, he knew that. Thats where the pain would be the more
intense. Those who can bedew a wound with tears bring easing to its
agony. And he told himself she would never shed one tear. He knew he
wasnt being sentimental. It was the hard bed-rock truth.
