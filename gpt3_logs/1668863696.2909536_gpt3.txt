SCENE:
XXIV


A WONDERFUL thing had happened to Jean. Gabrielle had smiled at him.
Her eyes, serene and secret, had for one swift moment met his with
sudden tenderness.

It made Jean, on his way home to Rue Lalo, almost too happy to breathe.

The May night swept his blood with hurrying magic, and in his heart a
tiny thread of golden melody was born.

It was the hour when Paris awoke; rich, expensive, passionate Paris,
and launched itself into swift, tireless motors, racing to and fro
through the transient pleasure of the night. The Champs lyses
stretched before him like a coil of swiftly flashing jewels. Fire
and speed, and the gay faculty of easy living, flamed its message
home to the world. It was to this great stream that Madame Torialli
belonged--belonged, that is, by birth, by position, by success; but
Jean no longer believed that she shared its life; the gay world was
such a small affair. The music in his brain sang a different story to
him. Gabrielle was a child at heart, she was like the soft unfolding of
the spring.

It was easy to think of her on a night full of stars. He knew that
Paris could not count for her any more than for him. It was a mere
glittering screen between them and their joy.

Jean flew up his steep, dark stairs in the Rue Lalo, and found Margot
tidying up his things. The most fatal mistake a woman can make, in the
eyes of a young man, is to be present when he is thinking of somebody
else. Margot had made it and she saw by Jeans eyes that she had made
it, and she did not feel as if she could ever see anything else.

Jean recognized that Margot was unhappy, and this angered him--he was
by nature sympathetic--but there are moments in life when even to the
sympathetic the sorrows of others bear a grotesque insignificance. Jean
hoped that Margot would not tell him why she was unhappy. It seemed to
him frankly incredible that anyone need be unhappy who lived in the
same world as Gabrielles smile.

And Margot had come there to tell him--still she, too, for the moment
saw the wisdom of putting it off.

They fell back on her music. Jean threw himself on the music-stool and
suggested that Margot should sing first this and then that. Never had
Jean given her such a comprehensive and variable singing lesson or paid
less attention to what she sang. At last the music came to an abrupt
end; there was no more music Margot could sing, and it appeared that
there was nothing more for either of them to say. Jean lit a cigarette
and sat there, shaking his foot to and fro in an agony of suppressed
impatience. He could not very well turn Margot out of his room, and yet
her very presence made the music that was within him less--the melody
seemed dwindling like a tiny stream choked by a fall of sand.

And then Margot spoke.

Jean, she said very simply, youve been for six months at the
Toriallis now; do you like it there?

It was an unfortunate choice of subjects--the last thing that Jean
wished to discuss with Margot or with anyone else was the Toriallis;
one of them he wished to forget, the other was too sacred for him to
dare to remember. He dropped his eyes and shrugged his shoulders.

Yes, I like it there well enough, he said. It has drawbacks--one
cannot have the flower without the root--music... He stopped,
the words choked him. To speak of music was to hear the sound of
Gabrielles voice.

Music? echoed Margot, and really a candid judge might have thought
Margots voice as satisfactory as Madame Toriallis. However, a young
lover is not a candid judge; Margots little echo irritated Jean.

What do you mean, Margot? he asked impatiently, although he did not
really want to know what Margot meant.

I somehow thought, she answered, that you hadnt had much
lately--not real music, I mean. Everything at the Boulevard Malesherbes
seems so--so mixed up with other things. They are of the great world,
arent they--the Toriallis--she goes out so much--and they entertain a
great deal. I wondered if you ever got enough time and freedom for your
real work?

Its very good of you, said Jean, to bother about me....

Oh, Jean! said Margot.

Jean bit his lips--he knew he mustnt talk like this to Margot--he made
a great effort, an effort so great that it showed.
