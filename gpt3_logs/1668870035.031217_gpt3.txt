SCENE:
Did you ever see anything like it, Doctor? said both parents, in a
breath.

Ive read of such cases. Its a calcareous enlargement of the vascular
bony tissue, threatening ossification, said the Doctor.

O, dreadful!can it be possible? shrieked both parents. Can anything
be done?

Well, I should recommend a daily lotion made of mosquitoes horns and
bicarbonate of frogs toes, together with a powder, to be taken morning
and night, of muriate of fleas. One thing you must be careful about: they
must never wet their feet, nor drink any water.

Dear me, Doctor, I dont know what I _shall_ do, for they seem to have a
particular fancy for getting into water.

Yes, a morbid tendency often found in these cases of bony tumification
of the vascular tissue of the mouth; but you must resist it, maam, as
their life depends upon it;and with that Dr. Peppercorn glared gloomily
on the young ducks, who were stealthily poking the objectionable little
spoon-bills out from under their mothers feathers.

After this poor Mrs. Feathertop led a weary life of it; for the young fry
were as healthy and enterprising a brood of young ducks as ever carried
saucepans on the end of their noses, and they most utterly set themselves
against the Doctors prescriptions, murmured at the muriate of fleas
and the bicarbonate of frogs toes, and took every opportunity to waddle
their little ways down to the mud and water which was in their near
vicinity. So their bills grew larger and larger, as did the rest of their
bodies, and family government grew weaker and weaker.

Youll wear me out, children, you certainly will, said poor Mrs.
Feathertop.

Youll go to destruction,do ye hear? said Master Gray Cock.

Did you ever see such frights as poor Mrs. Feathertop has got? said
Dame Scratchard. I knew what would come of _her_ family,all deformed,
and with a dreadful sort of madness, which makes them love to shovel mud
with those shocking spoon-bills of theirs.

Its a kind of idiocy, said Goody Kertarkut. Poor things! they cant
be kept from the water, nor made to take powders, and so they get worse
and worse.

I understand its affecting their feet so that they cant walk, and
a dreadful sort of net is growing between their toes; what a shocking
visitation!

She brought it on herself, said Dame Scratchard. Why didnt she come
to me before she set? She was always an upstart, self-conceited thing,
but Im sure I pity her.

Meanwhile the young ducks throve apace. Their necks grew glossy, like
changeable green and gold satin, and though they would not take the
doctors medicine, and would waddle in the mud and water,for which they
always felt themselves to be very naughty ducks,yet they grew quite
vigorous and hearty. At last one day the whole little tribe waddled off
down to the bank of the river. It was a beautiful day, and the river was
dancing and dimpling and winking as the little breezes shook the trees
that hung over it.

Well, said the biggest of the little ducks, in spite of Dr.
Peppercorn, I cant help longing for the water. I dont believe it is
going to hurt me,at any rate, here goes;and in he plumped, and in
went every duck after him, and they threw out their great brown feet as
cleverly as if they had taken rowing lessons all their lives, and sailed
off on the river, away, away among the ferns, under the pink azalias,
through reeds and rushes, and arrow-heads and pickerel-weed, the happiest
ducks that ever were born; and soon they were quite out of sight.

Well, Mrs. Feathertop, this is a dispensation! said Mrs. Scratchard.
Your children are all drowned at last, just as I knew theyd be. The old
music-teacher, Master Bullfrog, that lives down in Water-Dock Lane, saw
em all plump madly into the water together this morning; thats what
comes of not knowing how to bring up a family.

Mrs. Feathertop gave only one shriek and fainted dead away, and was
carried home on a cabbage-leaf, and Mr. Gray Cock was sent for, where he
was waiting on Mrs. Red Comb through the squash-vines.

Its a serious time in your family, sir, said Goody Kertarkut, and
you ought to be at home supporting your wife. Send for Doctor Peppercorn
without delay.

Now as the case was a very dreadful one, Doctor Peppercorn called a
council from the barn-yard of the Squire, two miles off, and a brisk
young Doctor Partlett appeared, in a fine suit of brown and gold, with
tail-feathers like meteors. A fine young fellow he was, lately from
Paris, with all the modern scientific improvements fresh in his head.
