SCENE:
He did not stay for the hand to come round with the gun, but slipped
sideways into the hall, closed the door behind him and drew the bolt
with which each of those doors was fitted. He slipped sideways along the
hall to the front door, which he bolted likewise. Then he stood for a
minute with his heart thumping, listening to hear whether the man were
breaking through the window or coming to the door for him.

After a minute, during which nothing happened, his eye caught the letter
that had been blown to the floor when he entered the house. The letter
was on the table within a few feet of him. It must have been the last
thing read in this house, he thought. What if it were the cause of all
the people leaving here? It may have brought the deciding news, probably
did. At least, it may be addressed to one of the Elenas, or will tell me
if this be Anselmo.

He looked at the envelope, which was addressed in a bold hand

 J. G.

He had a horror of looking at a private letter, even when made public in
a book or newspaper. Its a skunks trick, he said, but I do want to
know where I am. Ill apologise if I ever have the chance. He pulled
the enclosure from the envelope to read it. It proved not to be the
letter (that had gone), but a piece of paper which had been sent with
the letter. The paper was a half-sheet of coarse bluish notepaper on
which the same hand had pencilled the words, Si, Anselmo.

Now what on earth does that mean? Hi asked himself. Yes, Anselmo? I
would give something to know what is happening in this place. All was
silent about him, save for that ticking of the clock.

With a little chirrupping cry, the black cat, which had been sleeping in
the chair in the kitchen, came running along the passage. It was a slim,
small-headed, short-coated cat, not yet of full growth; it rubbed
against His legs and purred; Hi leaned down to stroke it, but watched
the passage to the kitchen.

That man has come in by way of the kitchen, Hi thought. He has scared
the cat, or let in a draught upon him. Ill be out of this.

The office window seemed to be the exit most likely to bring him out
beside his horse: he slipped into the office and closed the door behind
him. Then he listened, with a beating heart, for some swift, stealthy
footstep in the corridor or outside the window. Perhaps, he thought,
I shant hear any footsteps, only the brutes hand on the latch. Hes a
spy and a Red, that devil. Listen.

In that silence, the beating of the clock clanged like the tolling of a
bell. The cat, left to preen his fur in the hall, padded back towards
the kitchen. Hi was on the point of turning to open the inner shutter of
the window, when a little shrill whirring bell began to scream like an
alarm-clock upon some metal hooks on a stand at the table end. The shock
of the sound made his hair stand stiff upon his head. He saw the
instrument shaking on its hooks with the vehemence of the bell. He had
read and heard of these things, but had never before seen one. It rang
for ten seconds, then paused, then rang for five seconds and paused
again. Then it rang again with determination for half a minute on end,
as though bent on having an answer. Someone was telephoning to that
house of the dead.

His courage came back in a few seconds. Someone was telephoning: why
should he not answer? Possibly an English voice would speak to him or
someone who knew English. Even if there were a Red outside the door, he
owed it to Carlotta to run the risk, if by running it he could learn
where he was and where he should go next. He did not know how to take
the call. He lifted the instrument from its hooks and listened, now at
one end, now at the other, to silence. The thing is stopped, he said.
I dont know how to work the beastly thing. Yes? he called. Yes? Who
is there? What is it?

No answer come to him, not even the murmur of other voices which
sometimes comes over the telephone. Then suddenly the thought came to
him that perhaps the wire had been cut, or the unseen speaker shot down
somewhere far away. He put down the instrument, moved to the window and
opened the shutter. As he pulled it aside, the bell tinkled a little,
whimpered again, as though about to ring again, and then stopped. The
wires are cut, he muttered, that devil the spy has done it.

Peering out of the window, he could see nothing but a darkness which
gradually took shapes to itself of trees swaying in the wind, palms
clicking and clacking, and stars which became brighter as he gazed.
Here goes, Hi thought, I cannot see that devil; Ill risk it. So he
scrambled out, landed on his feet, and then stood for an instant lest
someone should spring upon him. No one sprang; there was neither sight
nor sound of anyone, only his horse nosing at the earth, and the wind
shuffling and clicking. He unhitched his rein, mounted and cautiously
rode forward.

At the space near the door he halted to listen and to try to see. No one
was there.
