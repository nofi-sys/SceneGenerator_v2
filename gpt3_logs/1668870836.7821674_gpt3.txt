Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Cheese it! whispered Murphy. But Roddy Ferguson had caught the words;
and he stood with his elbow resting on the piano top, chewing at the
end of his cigar, and looking with clouded brow into the fire. It was
an open secret that Bella had thrown him over for Martin Kelly; Roddy
was too quiet and steady to suit her light temperament, he lacked
Martins swagger and bluster, qualities which Bella liked, for she
was one of those women who mistake excess for a proof of spirit and
dissolute living for a mark of manhood.

Martin had found Bella waiting for him in front of Rileys. His anger
had not had time to cool, and he demanded roughly:

Well, what dyouse want?

Id like to speak to you Martin, timidly.

Say, dont youse begin to dog me up, dye hear! I wont have it!

You didnt meet me last night at Whalens dance like ye said ye would,
and I thought somethin might be the matter.

Nothins the matter only Im lectioneering for the old man, an I
aint got no time to meet women.

S-h-h! Mart Kelly, I dont thank you one bit for talkin to me like
that! Anybody to hear ye would think I was common.

He looked at her for a moment, and then laughed:

Oh, I guess not, said he.

Well, dont do it no more! I dont want people talkin about me and
giving me a shamed face. Ye know, yourself, theyd ony be too ready.
Oh, my Gawd, suddenly, here comes Mom!

Mrs. Nolan, a market basket upon her arm, came down the street with
staggering step. Dick had entrusted her with money enough to go
marketing and it had gone for drink; she was muttering to herself and
gesticulating drunkenly, and as she caught sight of the pair by the
curb, she halted:

Ah! cried she. Is it spharkin be the gutter yezed be doin,
jewels? Have ye no home till go till, Bella, that yez must stan on the
strate!

Oh, go home! cried Bella, scarlet with shame, everybodys lookin at
you!

Divil a hair do I care. Sure, an havent I the roight till take a
sup av drink iv I have the price? Its not long yez father ud be in
bizness, she added to Martin, iv it wurnt for the loikes av me.

The young man growled out an oath. He saw McGonagle looking at him
through Rileys window, and Riley, himself, with a grin upon his face.
A Saturday night crowd filled Second Street; many that knew him stopped
and looked and laughed; on the opposite corner, in front of Kerrigans
saloon and under the glare of an arc lamp, a crowd of loungers were
enjoying the sight; Officer Hogan was slyly pointing at him with his
club, and saying something to the bartender who stood in the doorway.

And is me poor home not good enough for yez, went on Mrs. Nolan with
increased pitch, that yez do be kapin me daughter stanin in the
strate till be talked about. Divil a better had yez father till he
tuk to sellin the drop. Lave go av me arm Bella; Ill go home whin I
plaze!

Yell go home now! said her son, pushing his way through the crowd
which had collected. For Gods sake, as she began struggling, dont
make a show of yourself! Tink of the neighbours!

May the divil fly away wid the neighbours! What call have I till be
afeerd av thim?

Come on, Mom, urged Bella, almost in tears, if ye go on this way,
Ill never show me face outside the door again!

Ye promised to do right, said Dick, with white face, and yell never
get another cent o my money in yer hands as long as ye live!

Kelly had darted into Rileys; and the tittering, thoughtless crowd was
growing greater.

Is this the way yez talks till yez owld mother! cried Mrs. Nolan.
May the cross av Christ darken the day yez wur born.

A man laughed loudly: Dick turned with a snarl, caught him by the
throat with one hand, the other drawn back for a blow. Bella screamed
and Hogan ran across the street.

Dont hit him, shouted the policeman; dont hit him, Dick! He
dragged the angry, shame-maddened youth away from his victim. I dont
want to pull yez, said he, for I know just how it is. Go along home,
now and take yez mother wid ye.
