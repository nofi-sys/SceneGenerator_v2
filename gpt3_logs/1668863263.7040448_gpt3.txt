Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Jean was accustomed to a large house full of old things, but they
were an entirely different type of old things from that of which his
Uncle Romain had acquired possession. They were old because they were
worn out and shabby, they were not old because they were precious and
rare. The reception-rooms through which he passed with Romain to the
drawing-room, where Madame DUcelles awaited them, were not larger
than those he had left behind him, but they seemed so, because of
their extraordinary brilliant emptiness. The first that they passed
through had nothing in it but portraits, and a wonderful old bronze on
a pedestal; this opened into another, with very little, very perfect
Louis XVI. furniture. The chimney was in marble, with a delicate Svres
china clock; in the corner was a grand piano covered with ancient
jewel-encrusted embroidery. A screen of painted leather stood by the
side of the fireplace, and one wall was entirely covered with shelves
of oriental china. Madame DUcelles and a small group of friends
stood by the fire. Jean had seen evening dress before in a provincial
theatre, but it was not in the least like this. He hardly recognized
his aunt in the bedizened, exposed, and highly coloured lady leaning
over an old rose-pink sofa in an attitude that she tried to make as
gracefully light as she could.

Madame la Comtesse DUcelles was extremely handicapped in the social
race by a hopeless lack of the _souplesse_ she adored.

One of Romains friends said of her: Our poor Marie would so love to
be thought indiscreet, but what can one say? She fights hard to produce
the appearance of evil, but the upper lip and the stubborn _bourgeois_
blood refuse to permit such laxity. She is hopelessly _bonne femme_,
she cannot be anything wilder than a dear old cow. It is true that she
can, if she likes, kick over the pail, but what she cant do is to
produce champagne instead of good rich country milk, and that, poor
dear, is what she wants to do! She cannot go to anyones head, she is
not intoxicating, she can only (look at our good Romain) help to create
an _embonpoint_!

Madame DUcelles upper lip might be against her, but she and her
dressmaker had fought hard to defeat it! Of all the little group around
her, she most looked to her nephew from the country, the extreme
presentment of the ultra-fashionable life he had heard of and read
about. Perhaps if Marie had known of this impression she might have
allowed it to soften her manner a little; but as it was, she fixed her
small, round, brown eyes on Jean, and despised him.

He was all the things she hated--poor, young, without even an incipient
material value, and yet, even in his badly-fitting clothes and in the
midst of a room full of strange sounds and light, and critical human
beings, there was in him that ineradicable ease of race.

He was shy but he was not awkward; he was embarrassed but he was not
as the men of her class would have been, clumsy. He did not, indeed,
know quite what to say, but he lifted clear eyes to her face; and if
there was anything that Madame DUcelles never forgave, it was dignity
in an inferior. Jean had not felt his uncles light laughter at his
appearance half as much as he felt the scornful glitter in his aunts
eyes. Without moving her elbow from the sofa on which she leaned, she
gave him her heavily bejewelled fingers to kiss.

Your train must have been late, I fancy, she said. I hope you left
your aunt well in the country; we must discuss our family affairs by
and by. Miss Vanderpool, let me introduce my nephew to you--le Baron
DUcelles, Miss Vanderpool. Romain, dinner has already been announced.

Jean turned his attention to a magnificent young woman who seemed to
take instant possession of him with a flicker of her stony, flat, grey
eyes.

I am delighted you can talk English, she said to her companion.
My! I do get so weary of trying to slip into French; not that I ever
do try very hard, though I take lessons every day, but one has to
understand a bit, so as not to be taken in.

Jean did not imagine that the young woman beside him would ever run
much risk in that direction. Pauline Vanderpool was indeed, as Romain
had told him, a very handsome young woman, but Jean thought she could
never under any circumstances have been a young girl. She was dressed
with consummate taste, though she wore rather too many pearls. She had
the finished manner of a woman who is accustomed to admiring obedience,
and he could never imagine anyone venturing either to deceive her or to
disagree with her.

I think the Comtesse is a real smart woman, she obligingly added to
Jean, as they took their seats. Shes your aunt, isnt she?

Yes, she is my uncles wife, said Jean.

Well! thats a good enough aunt in America, conceded his companion.
She says she likes me, she says she adores me; do you think shes
sincere?

Jean looked rather helpless.
