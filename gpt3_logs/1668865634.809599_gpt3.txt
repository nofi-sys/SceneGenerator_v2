What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
There were a few formalities to go through. A general agreement on the
time of the murder--a few minutes before seven disposed of that, and
the interrogation of Mrs. Stokes, the one eyewitness, followed.

She began well, telling the story she had told Bassett. When she
described her first view of Sybil running to the edge of the Point,
Rawson interrupted with a question:

Was she running fast, as if some one was after her, as if she was
frightened?

Yes, she was running fast but I dont know whether she was frightened.
I wasnt close enough to see anything like that, and I didnt have time
to see. Just as I was looking at her the shot came.

Did you notice the direction it came from?

No--it was like a sort of loud snap in the air. I heard it and she
staggered along a few steps and went over.

Did you hear any sounds--footsteps? A person makes a noise on this
rocky ground.

I didnt hear a thing. She leaned toward Rawson with haggard
insistence. I _couldnt_ hear anything. I was stunned. Mr. Bassett
asked me that and you all seem to think I ought to have heard the
person--the murderer--or tried to catch him. But I hadnt any sense, I
just stood there paralyzed, not grasping what had happened.

Mr. Bassett says you went out on the rocks and tried to catch the
body.

Oh, yes. _Then_ I came back to life. I ran down into the hollow and
out on the rocks as far as I could go. And she was going by on the
current--her hair and her dress all whirled about. Oh God, why was I
the one to see it!

Stokes addressed her, his voice low and urgent:

Flora, just try to answer quietly.

She paid no attention to him, her eyes riveted on Rawson.

And then you came back to the house?

Yes, but I stood there watching her for a few minutes. I dont know
how long, desperate, not knowing what to do. And then I started to run
back here and I fell down. I suppose I was shaking so and the rocks
were slippery. I think I fell twice, but I dont know. I seemed to be
half-crazy.

You saw or heard nothing on your way back?

No, no, I keep telling you, her voice grew higher. I _never_ saw
anybody. If anybody was there he must have been hiding. They could
have heard me--I was screaming. She turned to the others. Wasnt I
screaming?

Bassett confirmed her statement and she went on, her voice still
higher, the cords in her neck starting out:

Of course they heard me and hid--got out of the way. Some stranger.
We were all in the house, everybody here was in the house. It couldnt
have been any of them.

Stokes half rose: Flora--_please_!

She turned violently on him:

Why shouldnt I say it? Im not afraid. I was the only person outside
and it couldnt have been me. She faced round on Rawson. Nobody could
think that. Ask them--these people. Theyll tell you.

Thats not at all necessary, Mrs. Stokes. Rawson was mild and suave.
Now if youll try to be calm----

Calm, calm, she groaned and bent almost double, dropping her face
into her hands. Stokes got up, chalk-white in the lamplight:

My wifes pretty well knocked out, Mr. Rawson.

Quite understandable, Mr. Stokes. We wont trouble her any more just
now. And if the rest of you ladies and gentlemen will refrain from
saying what you think or offering suggestions well get on a good deal
quicker.

Stokes took his chair. Flora raised herself and dropped against
the back of hers with upraised chin and closed eyes. Bassett had a
photographic impression of Williams, striking softly on his teeth with
his fountain pen and looking at her.
