SCENE:
XXVI


HUGH HITS THE TRAIL

While Hugh was still at the bedside of his brother he began to make
arrangements for the thing he meant to do. Already he knew that Sam
Dutch had left town. Word had come to him that two horsemen in a
desperate hurry had clattered down the street from Doc Bentons stable.
They had disappeared in the darkness. But the man who had seen them go
had not recognized the companion of Dutch. Nor could he tell whether the
riders had turned off Carson Street into Kings Caon road, had swung to
the right along the foothills road, or had held to a straight course
toward Reno.

The news of the outrage spread fast. Friends of the McClintocks poured
into the Ormsby House by scores to see if there was anything they could
do. Among them were the Governor, a Justice of the Supreme Court,
half-a-dozen state senators and representatives, and the sheriff of the
county.

It was characteristic of Hugh that even in the anguish he felt at seeing
his brother stricken from lusty health by the bullets of assassins his
mind worked with orderly precision. When he thought of the murderers a
cold, deadly anger possessed him, but if possible he meant his vengeance
to come within the law.

Theres one thing you can do, Phil, he said to the sheriff. Swear me
in as a special deputy. Im goin out to get Dutch.

To bring him back here, you mean? asked the officer.

McClintocks eyes were inscrutable. Of course.

Now, looky here, son, thats our job, the sheriff remonstrated. Im
gonna git that fellow. Hes run on the rope too long. You stay right
here with Scot.

No. I want Dutch. Hes mine. Hands off till I can leave Scot, Phil.

The sheriff argued, but he could not move the grim-faced man from his
purpose. At last he gave way with a shrug of his shoulders. A wilful man
must have his way.

All right, son, Ill swear you in if youll promise to bring Dutch back
to Carson providin you git him.

I promise that.

Alive, the sheriff added.

Alive, agreed Hugh, meeting him eye to eye.

Baldy Green showed his teeth in a mirthless grin. A few of us here in
townll guarantee that if you bring him alive he wont go away alive.

The officer turned on him angrily. Thats a fine way to talk, Baldy.
You hold yore lines tighter. Monkey with my prisoner an Ill show you a
scatter gun that throws buckshot all over Carson.

Meanwhile Hugh kept the wires hot with messages. He telegraphed friends
at Virginia, Reno, Piodie, and Genoa, asking for news of the fugitives.
His suspicion fastened on Robert Dodson as the man who was riding with
Dutch. He knew the man had been in town earlier in the day, and he could
not through his friends locate him here now. The night travellers might
make for Virginia, where Dutch could lie hidden in one of the Dodson
mines till the excitement was past. Or they might be making for Genoa
with the intention of crossing the Sierras to California. More likely
still they were headed for Piodie, where the sheriff, the law machinery,
and the town bad men were all friendly to the Dodson interests. So Hugh
reasoned it out.

The sheriff shook his head. Dont look to me like Dodson would mix
himself up with Dutch now. Maybe he hired him to do this killing. I
dont say he did. I dont know. But it aint reasonable that hed give
himself away by ridin hellamile outa town with him.

Ralph Dodson wouldnt, but you cant tell what his brother might do. My
notion is he didnt intend to go, but afterwards lost his nerve and
wouldnt stick it out here alone.

Thatd be like Bob Dodson, Baldy confirmed. Hes got a sure enough
rabbit heart.

None of the answers to his telegrams brought Hugh the message he hoped
for. The fugitives had not been seen at Virginia, Genoa, or Reno, though
it was quite possible they might have reached or passed through any of
these places unnoticed. He decided to play what would nowadays be called
a hunch. The natural place for them to go was Piodie, and it was there
he meant to look for them.
