Write a detailed synopsis of the following scene:


SCENE:
Half a dozen dropped and still they came on, and three more of the
little band of defenders fell under the storm of bullets.

"Claymores!" cried Muckle John suddenly, and unsheathing his great
blade, he flung down his musket and charged upon the foremost of the
advancing soldiers.

Rushing fresh and swiftly, with the slope to aid them, they drove the
enemy back in confusion, hewing them down like corn under the scythe.
But two more men were lost and the holding of the pass was nearing
its end.

Last of all to retrace his footsteps into the narrow pathway was
Muckle John, and even as Rob turned to speak to him a shot rang out
and a bullet lodged in his ankle-bone.

"It's all over now, Rob," he said, looking at the wound.  "I couldn't
cover a hundred yards like this.  Go, laddie, and you, Grant, and
you, Macpherson--away with you.  I can hold the place for a time."
With the help of the man Macpherson he bound a piece of his shirt
tightly about his ankle, and rested upon his other leg.

All was very quiet outside.  Evidently the enemy were gaining breath
for the next and final assault.

"Away with you," said Muckle John.

But the two men would not leave him.  They stood with Rob, awaiting
his fury--and they had not to wait long.

"Grant," he screamed, "what is this?  Are you not sworn to obey me?
And you, Macpherson?  Oh, that I should be flouted to my very face!
Begone, or I will kill you with my own sword!"

They were now in full view of the soldiers, but no shot fell.
Possibly the sight of a wrangle at such a time was too amazing to be
missed.

Avoiding his eyes the two Highlanders drew apart from their
infuriated leader, and spoke together in Gaelic.

"Are you going?" roared Muckle John.

They nodded, and passing him, strode down the pass towards the
soldiery.

Even Muckle John was taken by surprise.  With a sharp cry he
attempted to stop them, but it was too late.  They were twenty yards
away before he had scrambled along the track.

Then leaning heavily upon the smooth face of the rock, he watched
them with wistful eyes, saying no more.

"Farewell!" he cried at last; and fetching out his chanter he began
to play the "Battle of the Clans," at which they turned and saluted
him, and then, swinging their claymores, rushed upon the soldiers,
and slashing right and left, fell amongst a heap of slain.

In the pause that followed Muckle John changed the tune to the
"Lament for the Children," which is like a moonlit sea for sadness.
All the glen lay silent for a space at his playing; In a kind of
superstitious fear the red-coats waited, dreading the black hills and
menacing landscape, but dreading most of all the stricken player up
above.  It was Captain Strange who shook them from their panic.

Very cautiously they began to creep upwards, and at that, Muckle John
put away his whistle, and turning for his sword, saw Rob standing
beside him, a bare claymore in his hand.

"You here!" he cried.  "I thought you had gone.  It was dreaming I
was, Rob.  Run, boy, for the night is close upon us.  Ye won't?
Well, well--it's a rare spirit ye have, Rob, but it's like to trip
you up this night," and he swept the passage with his sword.

"Guard you my legs, Rob, and when I'm tired of standing on one foot,
I'll lean against the wall."  So in the deepening gloom, without
further word they awaited the attack.

It came very suddenly.  Two soldiers rushed with a wild shout down
the echoing passageway.  One was pierced on the instant by the point
of Muckle John's sword; the other swung about, and was caught on the
turn by a lunge from Rob.

"Two," said Muckle John softly, and eased his dirk for the short
upward stab.  A moment's pause, and four men came at a cautious pace
towards them.  Muskets they carried, but they did not level them for
fear of hitting the Prince, for so they took the indistinct figure of
Rob to be.  Instead, they clubbed them, and prepared to smash down
the defence of their sword-play.  At that, however, Muckle John
slipped a pistol out of his belt, and discharged it in their faces,
to their utmost confusion.  One man screamed, and, holding his hands
to his eyes, dashed headlong down the slope.  His cries sent a chill
to Rob's very heart.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

Muckle John and a small band of defenders are holding a pass against a large group of soldiers. The soldiers are armed with muskets and are slowly driving the defenders back. Muckle John suddenly calls for claymores, and charges the soldiers with his great sword. The defenders manage to push the soldiers back, but two more men are lost in the process.
Muckle John is wounded in the ankle by a bullet, but he refuses to leave his post. The two remaining defenders, Grant and Macpherson, try to convince him to leave, but he refuses. The soldiers begin to advance again, and Muckle John screams at the two men to leave. They finally do, but Muckle John watches them go with wistful eyes.
The soldiers begin to creep up the passageway, but Muckle John is ready for them. He and Rob stand side by side, swords in hand, and manage to kill two of the soldiers. The soldiers retreat and Muckle John begins to play the "Battle of the Clans" on his chanter.
The soldiers wait in fear, but Captain Strange finally rallies them and they begin to creep up again. Muckle John and Rob manage to kill four more soldiers before the soldiers retreat again. This time, Muckle John plays the "Lament for the Children" on his chanter.
The soldiers creep up again, but this time they are met with a hail of bullets from Muckle John's pistol. One soldier is hit and screams as he falls down the slope. The soldiers retreat again and Muckle John and Rob prepare to defend the pass one last time.
