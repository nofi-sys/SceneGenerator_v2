SCENE:
Laird Carlin sensed genuine liking between the Control Operations
officer and the lame young engineer. Yet there was unspoken tension
too. It showed behind Jonny's cool smile and Floring's pleasant eyes.

Floring was looking past them, through the open doors of the workshop
at the towering magnetic dredge.

"Is that your new metal-finding dingus, Jonny? The thing you're going
to use to locate copper on Mercury?"

He stepped toward it. Harb Land made a violent movement forward, but a
flat look from his brother stopped him.

"Yes, that's it," Jonny said. "Want to look it over, Ross?"

Floring stood, cocking his head at the towering machine. He laughed at
the question.

"Jonny, you know I'm no engineer. A thing like this is beyond me." He
turned toward Carlin. "But Mr. Carlin, you're a CE. What do you think
of this new metal-finding device of Jonny's?"

Breathless silence held the group for a moment. Floring's face was
unmoved, pleasant, but his purpose was obvious now. Knowing that Carlin
had come to Earth merely as an Earth-treatment case, he was counting on
Carlin's unbiased truthfulness.

Carlin felt their eyes on him. Now was the time, he knew, to play the
part of a good galactic citizen and inform Floring just what was going
on. It was his duty to do it.

But he couldn't! He couldn't betray the last desperate hope of a
gallant old planet's people in their struggle against destiny! He had
known he couldn't, from the time Floring had first appeared. He spoke
as casually as he could.

"Yes, I've looked it over. It's one of the most ingenious metal-finders
I've ever seen."

Carlin felt a queer relief that was almost happiness, as he spoke. For
he knew now that he could never have obstructed these people in their
brave, desperate struggle to revive their planet.

But Ross Floring looked astounded. A little blank frown of surprise
came into his face and he stared steadily at Carlin.

"Then you approve of Jonny's plans?" he said quietly, "But, of course,
I might have known that he'd convince you."

There was double meaning to the Control officer's words, clear to all
of them. Yet they all ignored it.

Floring was temporarily defeated. He couldn't take action without
expert opinion that the machine before him was for Sun-mining. He had
expected such an opinion from Carlin, and had been disappointed.

But he was not completely frustrated. Carlin found out now how
thorough and resourceful was this pleasant young officer.

"It would be a shame, Jonny," Floring remarked casually, "if you should
run into disaster on this trip and the design of your new apparatus be
lost. A metal-finder like this is too valuable to lose."

They were momentarily puzzled by the comment. But in the next moment,
Floring showed what he had in mind. He drew from his jacket pocket
a tiny tri-dimen camera, stepped close to the towering dredge, and
before anyone could prevent it had snapped a half-dozen pictures of its
interior mechanism.

Harb Land started forward with a smothered oath. But it was too late.
Floring was already pocketing the camera.

"I'll keep these films," he said calmly. "If your machine should ever
be lost, the design of it will be preserved this way."

"You can't keep those films!" Harb Land exclaimed angrily. "You've no
right!"

"You surely don't think I would steal the design from you?" Floring
said, with a look of surprise.

"It isn't that," Harb protested. "But--"

"But what?" the officer asked calmly.

Harb was silent, his craggy face a mixture of emotions as he looked
appealingly at Jonny.

Carlin understood Floring's cleverness. They could not protest the
films without giving the real reason for their protest, and that they
could not do.
