SCENE:
XXI


Life was coming back again into Tophams arm, and by main strength he
forced his way through the crowd, making a path to the door for himself
and the countess. Once through the aperture, progress was easier,
though not too easy, for the crowd outside was packed and jammed about
the door. At last, however, he was free, just as the clatter of hoofs
on the granite told that the police patrol had arrived.

The countess clung to his arm, but made no attempt to speak. She was
dressed plainly, like a factory worker of the poorer class. She looked
much older than when he had seen her last, and he guessed that some of
the shadows on her face had been purposely put there by skillful hands.
Her hair puzzled him at first, but he soon guessed that its grayish
tinge was due to powder.

The mob was dispersing, fleeing in all directions, and the police were
plowing their way through it toward the wrecked restaurant.

Topham glanced about him, caught sight of the telegraph office that he
had noted half an hour before and quickly drew the woman up the steps
and inside.

As he turned toward the table with its pile of blanks, she caught him
by the arm. What are you going to do? she gasped.

Topham looked at her with infinite sadness in his eyes. I am going
to telegraph to the President that the anti-Japanese riots in San
Francisco have been provoked by German agents for the purpose of
embroiling Japan with the United States for some end that I cannot
guess. Afterwards, I should be glad if you can spare me a word. I owe
my life to you!

The countess took no notice at all of his last words. Her attention
was concentrated on what had gone before. You will not send that
dispatch! she pleaded.

I must. You know that I must.

But--but--as you say--I saved your life. If it had not been for me you
would not be alive to send anything. I think I have the right to ask
you not to send it. Please! For my sake!

The sweat crept out on Tophams forehead, but his tones did not falter.
I must, he answered.

Yet listen first to me! I have the right to ask you at least to
listen. Her voice, deep and rich, had lost none of its intensity, nor
her glorious eyes any of their appeal. Topham would have known them
anywhere; in fact, it was by them that he had first recognized her
when she flung herself upon him. Grant me at least ten minutes, she
begged. You will not refuse the first thing I ever asked of you!

Topham glanced up to where a clock face marked the hour. No! he said,
gently. I will not refuse to listen to you. But I can give you but
little more than the ten minutes you ask. My train leaves in an hour
and the ferry is some distance away. I will listen, but I cannot yield.
I have been ordered to Washington to tell the President what I know of
the Countess de Ouro Preto.

With round eyes the woman stared at him. So! she syllabled, under her
breath. So he suspects. _What_ does he suspect? she demanded fiercely.

I do not know.

But you can guess.

Topham shook his head. No, he answered, gently. I may not guess even
if I could. You know that, countess. No one knows it better than you.

Some great emotion seemed to sweep through the womans frame. She
shivered, though the night was not cold; her lips trembled; her eyes
stared blankly. Then, quick as it had come, the stress vanished and her
features shaped themselves into a mocking smile.

So, she said, bitingly. So all those pretty things you said to me in
Berlin and in Tokio were false. You amused yourself, perhaps?

Topham shook his head. They were true, he affirmed. They are still
true. You know it.

His directness was disconcerting. An appeal to one against ones self
usually is. But the scorn in the womans eyes did not lessen.

Yet you refuse?

Yes! I refuse. A flash of passion trembled in Tophams tones. God!
he cried. If I did not have to refuse! If I did not have to refuse!
