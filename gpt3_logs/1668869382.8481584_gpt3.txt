SCENE:
Felton sprang out of his berth and dressed hurriedly. Until the enemy
was within the "cruising radius" of torpedoes his station was on the
bridge with the captain. As he ran along the gun deck he heard through
the steel walls of the big ship the faint sound of distant firing, and
when he had bounded up the forward companion steps to the main deck he
could hear the singing of shells, and see through the inky blackness
twinkling points of flame. A crash and a jar of the whole huge fabric
told him that one ship of the enemy had the range, and that _something_
had struck _somewhere_, and penetrated.

There was no time for sight-seeing. The bridge was above him, and
the quickest road to it was by way of the turret, from the top of
which he could swing himself up. He mounted the iron ladder bolted
to the turret, but slipped on the hard steel roof and, with a force
that deprived him of breath, was pressed sprawling on his face. But
a deafening roar of sound from within the turret told him that the
force came from below--from the explosion of a shell and one or more
twelve-inch charges, perhaps the whole magazine in the depths. Hardly
had his dazed faculties grasped this fact than another was borne in
upon him. Gripping tightly the hand-hold of the turret hatch, and
choked with gas fumes oozing through the sight holes in the hood, he
felt that he was whirling through the air, upward and to port, he and
the whole turret roof. As it turned in air he could see for a moment
the dim, bulky outline of the ship below; then it faded into darkness,
and he was clinging for dear life to that slowly canting disk of
armored steel, until, as it assumed a perpendicular, he was holding his
weight with one hand, very curiously, as he then thought, weighing very
little. But he partook of the motion of the whole.

Something hard and rigid brushed him on the shoulder, and in a moment
he was torn from his support to find himself clutching a smooth, round
rod of what seemed to be steel or iron. It was perpendicular, and
beyond in the darkness he made out another, and beyond another. Looking
down he saw a long, pointed platform or deck, to the edge of which the
rods led. He was clinging to the stanchion of an airship, but what kind
of an airship he could not determine.

Thankful for life and a whole skin--though bruised and shocked almost
into unconsciousness--he slid down the stanchion to the deck, and faced
a man in the darkness--a tall man who peered down at his face.

"Hello, who are you, and where'd you come from?" he asked, rather
kindly. "How'd you get aboard!"

"I hardly know myself. I hardly know I'm alive. This is an airship,
isn't it?"

"Yes."

"My name is Felton, torpedo officer of the battleship _Argyll_. There
was an explosion in the forward turret, and I was on top. I went up
with the roof."

"Was that a turret top? I wondered what they were shooting at us."

"It was. I was rifling it. Which side are you on in this mix?"

"The side of the Lord."

The man whistled shrilly, and immediately half a dozen other dark
forms materialized out of the dark. They threw themselves upon Felton,
choked, pinioned, and bore him down, and before he could speak his
protest he found himself bound hand and foot.

"Stay there," said the tall man, who seemed to be the commander, "until
we need to expend weights. We _did_ want a little more ballast."

Felton wisely accepted the situation, and remained through the waning
night where they had placed him. They had not gagged him, and he was
free to roll over and change his position when tired. He lay on what
seemed to be a grating, but on turning to look at it, he found that it
was the deck of the car, through the slits of which he could see lights
below, and the quick gleaming of distant gun fire, but nothing on the
black carpet that took form and identity.

In his immediate vicinity, however, objects were becoming faintly
visible in the first blink of the morning light that had not yet
reached the surface below. He made out the shape, size, and general
construction of the craft that carried him. It was not the conventional
elongated gas bag, with car and motor, rudder, and screw; nor was it
suspended in the air by wings or planes, unless the long, concave roof
above, toward the edge of which the stanchions led, performed some
such function. Amidships were a vertical and a horizontal steering
wheel, aft a noisily buzzing engine, and, behind it in the darkness,
presumably, were the screw and rudders that propelled and guided
the craft. Symmetrically disposed about the deck were long, steel
cylinders that doubtless contained the compressed gas or air that
worked the engine, and through and between them all a system of pipes,
valves, levers, and indicators, as complicated as the fittings of an
engine-room. The tall commander was at the wheel amidships, another man
at the engine, and the rest of the crew, seven in all, were scattered
about the deck "keeping lookout," not ahead, but down.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the reader to the main character, Felton, and to establish the setting and conflict of the story. Felton is introduced as a torpedo officer on a battleship, and we learn that he has been injured in an explosion. He wakes up to find himself aboard an unknown airship, and is immediately captured by the crew. The scene establishes the main conflict of the story, which is Felton's efforts to escape and return to his own ship.
