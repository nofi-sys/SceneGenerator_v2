SCENE:
III

A FLARE-UP


The red car stopped before it completely overturned. Then, when the
exhaust was shut off, the screams of the two girls in the back seat
could be heard. But nobody shouted any louder than Montmorency Shannon.

The red-haired boy had leaped from the phaeton and had seized the pony
by the bit. Otherwise the surprised animal might have set off for home,
Amy said, "on a perfectly apoplectic run."

The little animal stood shaking and pawing, nothing but the shafts and
whiffle-tree remaining attached to it by the harness. The rear wheels
of the racing car were entangled in the phaeton and it was slewed
across the road.

"Now see what you've done! Now see what you've done!" one of the girls
in the car was saying, over and over.

"Well, I couldn't help it, Belle," whined the reckless young Brewster.
"You and Sally Moon aren't hurt. And you asked to ride with me, anyway."

"Oh, I don't mean you, Bill!" exclaimed the girl behind him. "But that
horrid boy with his pony carriage! What business had he to get in the
way?"

"Hey! 'Tain't my carriage, you Ringold girl," declared Monty Shannon.
"It's Cabbage-head Tony's. He'll sue your father for this, Bill
Brewster. And you come near killing me and the pony."

"I don't see how you came to be standing just there," complained the
driver of the red car. "You might have been on the other side of the
drive."

"He ought to have been!" declared Belle Ringold promptly. "He was
headed the wrong way. I'll testify for you, Bill. Of course he was
headed wrong."

"Why, you're another!" cried Monty. "If I'd been headed the wrong way
you'd have smashed the pony instead of the carriage."

"Never mind what they say, Monty," Jessie Norwood put in quietly.
"There are three of us here who saw the collision, and we can testify
to the truth."

"And me. I seen it," added Henrietta eagerly. "Don't forget that
Spotted Snake, the Witch, seen it all. If you big girls tell stories
about Monty and that pony, you'll wish you hadn't--now you see!"
and she began making funny gestures with her hands and writhing her
features into perfectly frightful contortions.

"Henrietta!" commanded Jessie Norwood, yet having hard work, like Nell
and Amy, to keep from laughing at the freckle-faced child. "Henrietta,
stop that! Don't you know that is not a polite way--nor a nice way--to
act?"

"Why, Miss Jessie, they won't know that," complained little Henrietta.
"They are never nice or polite."

At this statement Monty Shannon burst out laughing, too. The red-haired
boy could not be long of serious mind.

"Never you mind, Brewster," he said to the unfortunate driver of the
red car, who was notorious for getting into trouble. "Never mind; we
ain't killed. And your father can pay Cabbage-head Tony all right. It
won't break him."

"You impudent thing!" exclaimed Belle Ringold, who was a very proud and
unpleasant girl. "You are always making trouble for people, Montmorency
Shannon. It was you who would not finish stringing our radio antenna at
the Carter place and so helped spoil our picnic."

"He didn't! He didn't!" ejaculated Henrietta, dancing up and down in
her excitement. "It was me--Spotted Snake! I brought down the curse of
bad weather on your old picnic--the witch's curse. I'm the one that
brought thunder and lightning and rain to spoil your fun. And I'll do
it again."

She was so excited that Jessie could not silence her. Sally Moon burst
into a scornful laugh, but her chum, Belle, said, fanning herself as
she sat in the stalled car:

"Don't give them any attention. These Roselawn girls are just as low as
the Dogtown kids. Thank goodness, Sally, we will get away from them all
for the rest of the summer."

"Your satisfaction will only be equaled by ours," laughed Amy Drew.
