SCENE:
Henri regarded Jean with perplexity when he came out of the Louvre.

Monsieur le Baron has perhaps met a friend? he asked inquisitively.

Jean blushed a little.

Yes, he said simply, I have met a friend.

Monsieur begins well, replied Henri with relief. In Paris one needs
friends. And now for the Bank, Monsieur le Baron. This to your left
here is the Luxembourg; in the summer the garden has a most _chic_
appearance. One finds there the smartest nursemaids in Paris; there are
also pictures within. I have an idea that we may find Monsieur rooms
behind the Luxembourg. I shall make the endeavour; since Monsieur is to
be alone at first, cheerful surroundings are of importance. Here is the
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, as Monsieur le Baron sees.

Jean hesitated a moment before the heavy front of his future prison.
He knew quite well it would be to him a prison, and he feared his
first deliberate entrance into it. He had not realized how he had
counted on his light-hearted, unembarrassed uncle to help him make
the first plunge into a serious life, but he remembered that he was
after all Jean DUcelles, and that he would not have liked the Venus
of Milo to be ashamed of him; so he pushed back the heavy doors and
entered, presenting his letter quite firmly to a youth who was under
the impression that it was his place as doorkeeper to impede as far
as possible anyone who wished to go out or in. After a contemptuous
stare at Jean, he turned the letter over, whistled, and vanished. By
and by a much more important individual requested Jean to follow him;
and he passed through a green-baize door shrouded in mystery, and found
himself in the Directors room.

The Director gave him fully five minutes; he told him where to go next
morning, and said that he might begin his duties then, and that the
head clerk would tell him what to do. The Director asked after the
Comte DUcelles and suggested that some day Jean might dine with him.
Then he rang the bell and dismissed him. The one idea that had come to
Jean during this important interview was that there was something the
matter with his clothes. He explained his fears to Henri and consulted
him about Romains tailor, though he thought he would probably prove
too expensive.

Why should Monsieur le Baron pay for his clothes at all? asked Henri.
The name is the same.

Jean was very indignant with Henri, which was a mistake, because Henri
instantly retired into his shell.

_Mon Dieu!_ he said to himself. They come from the country with
their eyes glued shut and their mouths open, and then wonder why they
remain hungry! It is, after all, only in Paris that we know how to get
the world between our teeth! Let him learn this! For myself, I shall do
better to keep my mouth shut. It is a terrible task to teach a fool.
And so Jean lost his only friend in Paris.

In the end Jean ordered the suit, and was relieved to find that he
should not have to pay for it at once.

He has come to Paris straight from the _bon Dieu_, thought Henri.
_Quelle btise!_

Monsieur le Baron will get very wet if he wishes to go as far as Ntre
Dame, he remarked aloud. But from this bridge here across the Seine
we can see it very well. I should say if anything better; it is not a
fashionable church!

Jean strained his eyes through the curtain of rain to catch the towers
of Ntre Dame. To-day there was no sunshine, and the cathedral crouched
menacingly under the dispirited sky, a big, colourless block of
time-defiant stone. Henri shivered ostentatiously--he did not wish to
encourage Jean to remain out longer in the rain. He ventured to suggest
that rain in Paris being, as a well known fact, highly dangerous for
strangers, Monsieur le Baron would do well first to get something of
a cordial nature to drink, and then to find his lodgings as soon as
possible. Jean obeyed both suggestions, and Henri benefited, as he had
intended, by the first.

It was not, however, so easy to find lodgings; everything--even
the least attractive rooms at the top of the steepest flight of
stairs--seemed to Jeans country mind wickedly extravagant.

But one cannot need to pay all that just for a room to sleep in? he
expostulated over and over again.

In Paris, observed Henri, the very air is worth more than elsewhere,
but, Monsieur le Baron, I grieve very much to have to say it, hitherto
we have made an attempt to keep to the fashionable quarter. I know very
well where we can get rooms cheaper, but I had not wished to mention
it. On my return, Monsieur le Comte will snap his fingers and say to
me, Then you have buried Monsieur my nephew in a neighbourhood of
greengrocers; I am to fall over cabbages in order to see him, _hein_!
And yet if one cannot have Bohemian pheasants, one need not starve on
soup made from bones! That is how I look at it, Monsieur le Baron.
Shall we try another quarter?
