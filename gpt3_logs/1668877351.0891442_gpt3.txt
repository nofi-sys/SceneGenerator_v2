SCENE:
XII

THE WICKEDNESS OF MOLLY BIDDULPH


YOU perceive, therefore, that Chance had truly played the game well.
John--a radiant John--apologized within his soul for his one-time
doubt of the Sprites arrangement of affairs. The sun immediately
shone brighter, the sky was bluer, the earth an altogether fairer and
lovelier place.

He made his way swiftly back to the White Cottage. There, in the
parlour, he found what he sought, a pale grey envelope lying on the
table. Quickly he broke the seal, perused the opening words:

My grandmother desires me....

Johns heart thumped madly. It was exactly as he had hoped,--her
handwriting, her signature! The faintest scent of lavender was wafted
to him from the paper.

We shall be lunching at Delancey Castle tomorrow, said John, with
a fine air of casualness, to Mrs. Trimwell, who was setting out the
tea-things. Inwardly he was aware that an almost idiotic smile of
pleasure was wreathing itself about his lips.

Mrs. Trimwell beamed. You might have fancied, seeing her, that the
invitation had been extended to herself.

Im glad, said she, heartily and concisely. You need cheering up a
bit.

I do? John was surprised.

Yes, replied Mrs. Trimwell. Ive noticed well enough that youve
been down on your luck like these last three days, and no wonder with
not a soul to speak to except Mr. Elmore, and him everlasting on
ladders chiselling of the walls, which it isnt the easiest way to be
talking at the same time, Ill be bound. Youve done nothing but wear
yourself out a-trapezing round the country in the heat, and come home
that tired youve no stomach for your food. Ive eyes in my head. Mrs.
Trimwell nodded emphatically.

Oh, but really-- began John feebly, and with something like a queer
sense of guilt, I havent----

Youve been dull, reiterated Mrs. Trimwell firmly, and if you _say_
you havent you dont deceive me, no more than my Tilda did when she
come into the house half an hour agone looking for all the world like
a choir boy a-singing of hymns. Where ha you been, Tilda? says I.
Tilda, she glinted at me out of the corner of her eye. Oh, round and
about, mother, says she. And tis round and about with Molly Biddulph
youve been then, I says. And Tilda, she begins to snivel, knowing
Ive told her times out of number I wont have her going around with
Molly, whos the worst young limb of mischief to the village. Theres
nothing that child wont do, from getting unbeknownst into Jane Kellys
shop and changing the salt and sugar in the jars, to tampering with the
very books in the church itself. Did I ever tell you about her and the
banns of marriage, sir?

You did not, replied John.

It was her cousin from Dublin what helped her, I know, announced Mrs.
Trimwell, being a boy, and good at writing, and old enough to think of
the wickedness. But twas Molly stole the key, as Father Maloney got
her to own, and seeing she goes to his church, being Irish papists, I
wonder he dont keep her in better order. Vicar, he was away for a
Sunday or two, and got another parson what he called a lokomtinum to
come down. Molly, she stole the key of the vestry from Henry Davies
whats the verger, and used to keep the key in a china cat on his
parlour mantelpiece, but has carried it tied to his watch chain ever
since, and her and Patsie sneaked off down to the church when Vicar had
gone, and got the book of banns to be called. There wasnt but one bann
to be called, Lily Mortons, her that married the blacksmith over to
Bradbury three months agone. Patsie and Molly wrote down the rest. They
coupled off Mr. Healy and Miss Sweeting, and Mr. Porter and Miss Janet
Cray, and Mr. Lethbury and Miss Martha Bridges, whats all over fifty
if theyre a day, and the respectablest spinsters for miles round, and
Mr. Healey hes in his dotage, and Mr. Porter whats afraid to look a
woman in the face, and Mr. Lethbury a married man with a wife a bit of
a termagent. They said afterwards--Molly and Patsie--they had to give
Miss Martha Bridges to somebody, and there wasnt no unmarried men but
Mr. Healey and Mr. Porter, and theyd fixed them to Miss Sweeting and
Miss Janet Cray. Well, the lokomtinum he dont know no more than Adam
who the people in the village are, and when it come to the banns, out
he reads the sinfulness them two have written down. Mrs. Morton, the
butchers wife, she was there, and she told me afterwards you might ha
heard the gasp that went round the church up to the Castle. Mr. Porter
took and bolted, and hasnt been seen outside his gates yet. Mr. Healey
wasnt there, and Mr. Lethbury he sat with his jaw dropped and his eyes
a-sticking out of his head. Miss Martha Bridges had hysterics, and the
only ones that seemed a bit pleased and fluttery-like was Miss Sweeting
and Miss Janet Cray, specially Miss Janet. Suppose them two thought it
was a new kind o way of proposing, not having the courage to do it
otherways. Mrs. Trimwell stopped.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to establish John as a sympathetic character and to set up the conflict between John and Molly Biddulph. The author achieves these goals by having John be pleased with the prospect of seeing Molly again and by having Mrs. Trimwell establish Molly as a mischievous character.
