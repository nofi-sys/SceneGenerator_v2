SCENE:
XXVII


THE SYMBOL

THE long white fingers of winter reached down through the mountain
gulches to the Circle Diamond. Ruth looked out of her windows upon a
land grown chill and drear. She saw her line riders returning to the
bunk house crusted with snow and sleet. The cattle huddled in the
shelter of haystacks, and those on the range grew rough and thin and
shaggy.

The short days were too long for the mistress of the ranch. She began to
mope, and her loneliness was accented by the bitter wind and the deep
drifts that shut her from the great world outside. A dozen times she was
on the point of going to Denver for the winter, but her prideand
something finer than pride, a loyalty that held her back from pleasures
Rowan could not share and tied her to interests which knit her life to
hiswould not let her give up the task she had set herself.

Through Louise McDowell, the wife of the governor, she ordered a package
of new books sent in from Cheyenne. With an energy almost fierce she
attacked her music again, and spent hours practising at the piano. When
the winds died down she made Jennings show her how to travel on
snowshoes, and after that there was seldom a day during which she could
not be outdoors about the place for at least a little while.

Her fragility had always been more apparent than real. Back of her
slenderness was a good deal of wiry strength. As the months passed she
took on flesh, and by spring was almost plump. The open life she
cultivated did not help her pink-and-white complexion, but brought
solidity to her frame and power to her muscles.

The boy was born in early April. Norma Tait and Mrs. Stovall nursed her
back to health, and in a few weeks she was driving over the ranch in
consultation with Jennings.

She had a new venture in her mind, one of which he did not approve at
all. She intended to raise head lettuce for the market.

Her foreman did his best to dissuade her from such a radical
undertaking.

This here is a cattle country, maam. Thas what the Lord made it for.
O course its proper to put in some wheat an some alfalfa where we can
irrigate from the creek. I got nothing to say against that, because with
the price of stock good an the quality improved we cant hardly afford
to have em rough through the way they used to do. We got to feed. Thas
reasonable. But why lettuce? Why not cabbages or persimmons or sweet
peas, maam, if you come to that.

Jennings softened his derision with a friendly smile.

Because there is money in this head lettuce. Ive been reading about it
and corresponding with a farmer in Colorado who raises it. He has made a
lot of money.

Probly he ships to Denver. But Denver aint such a big city that it
cant be overstocked with a commodity. It aint any New York.

But he ships to New York and all over the country. Its like this. By
midsummer the lettuce crop of most of the country is exhausted. The
weather is too hot for it. But up in the mountains it can be raised. It
develops into a fine solid head, the crispest in the world. Mr.
Galloway, the ranchman I told you about, writes that there is no limit
to the market and that this is going to be a permanent and a stable crop
for the Rocky Mountain country. He is very enthusiastic about it.

Thas all right too. I dont claim he aint right. But were cattlemen.
The Circle Diamond is a cattle ranch. It aint any Dago truck farm. Me,
Id never make a vegetable-garden farmer, not onless my farmin could be
done from the saddle. We know cattle; we don know lettuce.

If theres money in it we can learn to know it.

How do we know theres money in it here? This aint Colorado, come to
that. Maybe it takes a particular kind of soil and temperature. Maybe
this guy Galloway just happens to be in a lucky spot.

Not from what I read. Anyhow, we can put out a few acres and see how it
does.

Why, yes, we could, admitted Jennings. If we knew how to fix the land
for it an how to look after it. But we dont. Why, we dont even know
what kind of seed to buy or what kind of ground to put it in. Honest,
maam, it looks plumb ridiculous to me.

Not to me, she dissented. Whats the use of saying that this is a
cattle country and not good for anything else when we havent tried
other things? People have to be progressive to make money. As for your
objection about us not knowing the kind of seed to get or the sort of
land to use or how to prepare the land, why youre wrong in all three of
your guesses. You buy seed called New York or else the Wonderful, and
you plant it in nice rich soil prepared the way you do a garden. I
thought wed use that twenty back of the pasture.
