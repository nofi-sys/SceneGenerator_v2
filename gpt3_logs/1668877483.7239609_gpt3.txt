SCENE:
Corin found the joys of scraping plaster off walls beginning to pall.
Apparently he had come to an end of discovery.

It is one thing to delve for new treasures, it is another to scrape for
hours on end to find a mere repetition of design. However delightful
masonry and herb Robert may be when it dawns freshly on the sight,
its continued contemplation waxes somewhat stale. To his judging, and
no doubt he judged rightly, there were still yards and yards of it to
be uncovered. Monotony, therefore, crept upon his soul. With a view,
then, to relaxing the monotony, and taking into consideration that the
sunshine without the church appeared infinitely preferable to the gloom
within, he laid down his tools this particular afternoon a full hour
before his customary time, and came out into the open.

And here, for a moment, he paused.

Before him, eight miles distant, lay Whortley, to be reached by road or
field, according to inclination. He ruled out that notion promptly. To
the right lay the river, the silver ribbon bordered by pollard willows;
to the left lay wood and moorland; behind him and the church lay the
sea. It was distant a mile or thereabouts, and the sun was distinctly
hot. But what of that! Wouldnt the music of its voice on the shore,
the colour of its sparkling waters, the coolness of the little breeze
that would sweep across its surface, be well worth the tramp?

The sea for me! cried Corin to his heart. And thats rhyme, and Im
not sure that it isnt poetry if you take into consideration the vision
it conjures up. In fact, taking that into consideration, I am sure that
it _is_ poetry.

Whereupon he wheeled around.

First the route lay uphill towards Delancey Castle. It was a stiffish
climb. The sun, beating upon the white roadway, flung waves of heat up
from it. They shimmered before his spectacled, short-sighted eyes in
an irritating glaring dance. His round, cherubic face was glowing to a
deep crimson before he was half-way up the ascent. The vision he had
conjured up of the seashore might truly be poetical, but I question
the poetry in the appearance of the little man trudging towards that
vision. Yet this is unkind. Who are we to judge from appearances? Truly
may poetic aspirations be hidden beneath the most unlikely exteriors.

At the top of the hill, Corin paused, looking reflectively down the
long avenue. Exhaustion rather than reflection prompted the pause,
nevertheless he gave vent to a sage one.

_Omne ignotum pro magnifico_, he remarked, by which token, I fancy,
our young American friend down yonder had a very different conception
of what he was going to find up here. He has found less magnificence
than irksomeness, I take it. Now, I wonder why karma----

But I refuse to follow Corin in his meditative flights in this
direction. It is sufficient to note that we see him, from the remark
I have given you, in like mind with three at least of our other
characters herein mentioned.

His meditation on the mysteries of karma completed, and his exhaustion
being in part, at least, lessened, Corin pursued his way. His route
was level now, leading presently to a footpath across an expanse of
short grass. Here he came upon full view of the sea--blue, sparkling,
radiant, dotted with white- and red-winged sailing boats.

Coming at length to a rough, descending track, he made his way down it.
It brought him into a cove, a place of white sand, smooth and gleaming.

Truly here was all that his vision had expected. The grass-crowned
cliffs sloped down to the cove in rugged grey walls, samphire-covered.
Nor did the grey rocks stop abruptly on reaching the white sand, but
ran out into it, as if eager to gain to the sun-kissed water. Little
pools lay among them, mirrors reflecting the blue of the sky. In the
pools waved feathery fronds of sea-weed--pink, crimson, and brown; tiny
silver fish darted hither and thither; sea anemones stretched forth
dainty flower-like tentacles.

This, remarked Corin to his soul, was worth the tramp.

And he sat down on the warm white sand.

There wasnt a soul in sight; nothing but those white- and red-winged
boats, making a lazy headway with the tide, to remind him of his fellow
mortals, and they but added to the beauty of the picture. The water
broke in baby waves on the shore, with the faintest musical ripple.
Sea-gulls dipped to the shining surface, or floated smoothly in the
blueness above. Now and again a cormorant flew, black and long-necked
across the water.

Some half-hour or so Corin sat there, basking and dreaming in the sun,
thinking, you may be pretty certain, of nothing, or at all events with
thoughts too diffused to be worthy of the name.
