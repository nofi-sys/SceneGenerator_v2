SCENE:
Roy was hurrying to his own room to slick up, as he called it,
when Teddy burst into the house.

I just wanted to-- he began. Then, seeing his brother was alone,
he stopped in confusion.

Go on, tell me, Roy jeered. I make a fine audience. What was it
now?

Nothing! answered Teddy, his face a trifle red. I--I forget what
I was going to say. Where you bound for in such a rush?

Oh, I was just going to put on a clean shirt, Roy responded
carelessly. Have to dog-up a bit for supper.

Uh-huh, Teddy grunted, with a grin. For supper! Sure! Have to get
dogged-up for supper. Guess I will, too. Then his face took on a
more serious expression. Say, Roy, you dont think well have to
stop looking for those thieves while the girls are here, do you?

Ill tell a maverick we wont! Roy exploded. Not if dad has
anything to say about it, and I guess he has! He wants General back,
and he wants him bad. If any clue turns up, well go right after the
rustlers!

The evening meal, with the two girls as guests, was a jolly one. Mr.
Manley was at his best, and his chuckling remarks kept the company
in a gale of laughter, though often he directed a sly remark toward
Roy or Teddy, which caused them to change the subject hurriedly.
Belle, following her fathers leads, contributed not a little to the
general hilarity.

When the meal ended they all strolled into the living room of the
ranch, a large, well-lighted apartment with a huge oak table in the
center, on which were piled books and magazines. A stone hearth was
built into the wall, and a log fire was crackling away merrily,
lighted, Mr. Manley hastened to explain, with a sly grin at his
wife, not for warmth but for effect. Above the fireplace, was the
mounted head of a bison, set on a wooden panel.

Oh, I think this is simply gorgeous! Ethel murmured as she looked
about her. Belle, you dont know how lucky you are to be able to
live in such a wonderful place!

Maybe she wishes she could live in New York, Teddy remarked, with
a glance at his sister. Then she could go to parties and dances
every night--if she had any one to take her.

I wouldnt want to go to dances every night, Teddy Manley, and you
know it! Belle answered. Even if I did have some one to take me,
and she pouted in mock anger.

There wouldnt be much difficulty about that, Nell declared, with
a look at Belles raven hair and lustrous, dark eyes.

So you think my girl would be the Belle-Ada of the town, hey? Mr.
Manley laughed, as he ruffled his daughters hair with an
affectionate hand. Well, maybe next year you can go to school in
New York if you want to, daughter.

And leave you and mother? Belle asked with wide eyes. No! Not me,
Daddy!

Of course she forgets all about Ted and me, Roy said, grinning.
We just _live_ here. Nell, what would you do with a sister like
that?

Now dont tease, Mrs. Manley said, and smiled. Bardwell, couldnt
we have some sort of entertainment for the girls? Some of the
cowboys play musical instruments. Dont you think theyd oblige us?

Nick Looker! exclaimed Teddy and Roy in the same breath.

Whats Nick do? Play on the linoleum? Mr. Manley asked, with a
grin.

The mouth-organ, Dad, Teddy replied seriously. What do you say?
Shall we get him to perform? Hell do it, I know.

How about getting Norine to dance that Irish jig of hers? Roy
suggested. With Nick playing for her, she ought to be great!

Yea, if Nick doesnt get too bashful when he sees Norine, Teddy
said. But lets try it. Shall we, Mother?

Hardly waiting for the assent he knew his mother would give, Teddy
made for the front door.

Belle, he called over his shoulder, you go and talk to Norine!
Tell her Nick loves to see her dance. Then shell come. Roy, grab
some of these chairs and cart em out on the porch. We can all sit
there. Well have a moonlight show!
