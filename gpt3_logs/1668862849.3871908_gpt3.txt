SCENE:
This isnt a womans job. Get out, he told her curtly.

Perhaps she resented his manner at the moment, but when half an hour
later he emerged from the tunnel carrying the maimed body of the little
fellow she forgot her pique. The mans hands were torn and bleeding, his
face stained with sweat and streaks of dirt. The clothes of which he was
usually so careful were daubed with yellow clay. She remembered only
that he had risked his life to save Johnny.

Nor could she forget it when he called that evening at her boarding
house, ostensibly to tell her that the doctor had set Johnnys broken
leg and found no other injury from the accident.

Its going to be hard on his mother. You know shes a widow and takes
in washing, Vicky said. I wonder if we couldnt give a school
entertainment for her benefit.

It wont be necessary, he said promptly. Its partly my fault the
accident happened. As school clerk I should have had the mouth of the
tunnel boarded up. Im going to pay all the bills and see that Mrs.
Haxtun doesnt lose anything by it.

Victoria felt a glow at her heart. It always did her good to find out
that people were kinder and more generous than she had supposed. Her
judgment of Ralph Dodson had been that he was hard and selfish. Now she
was ashamed of herself for thinking so. She thought of the Greater love
than this verse, and in her soul she humbled herself before him. What a
little prig she had been to set herself up as arbiter of right and
wrong.

Dodson made the most of the opportunity chance had given him. He used it
as a wedge to open up a friendship with the girl. She was still
reluctant, but this was based on some subconscious impulse. All the fine
generosity in her was in arms to be fair to him regardless of his
brother.

As soon as he learned that she had a claim on Bald Knob that she wanted
to develop Dodson put his experience at her service. He helped her
arrange with a man to do the actual assessment work and he went over the
ground with her to choose the spot for the shaft. Afterwards he kept an
eye on Oscar Sorenson to see that he did a fair days work for the pay
he received.

On holidays Vicky usually walked or rode out to her claim to see how
Sorenson was getting along. She was pretty apt to meet Dodson on the way
to Bald Knob or else superintending operations there. Two or three times
he came down to her prospect at noon and they strolled up a little gulch
to pick wild flowers and eat their lunch together.

He knew so much more about the world than she did that she found his
talk interesting. The glimpse she had had of San Francisco had whetted
her appetite. Were other cities like the one by the Golden Gate, gay and
full of life and fashion which young girls at a finishing school were
not permitted to see? He told her of London and Paris and Vienna, and
her innocent credulity accepted what he said at face value. He had the
gift of talk, the manner of a man of the world. From the confident ease
of his descriptions she could not guess that he had never been in Paris
or Vienna and only once in London for a flying visit to float a mining
scheme.

Youll not be going to the mine to-day, dearie, Mrs. Budd said to
Vicky one Saturday morning when the hills were white with a blanket of
snow.

Yes. I promised Oscar to bring his mail and some tobacco. Besides, I
want to see how hes been getting along.

If you take my advice youll stay comfy at home and not go traipsing
all over the hills gettin your feet an your skirts wet.

One of the things Vicky rarely did was to accept advice and follow it. A
fault of her years and of her temperament was that she had to gain her
wisdom through experience.

I love to get out in the snow and tramp in it, Vicky said cheerfully,
helping herself to another hot biscuit. And Ill not get wet if I wear
arctics and tuck up my skirts when Im out of town.

Hmp! If youre set on it youll go. I know that well enough. But youll
come home early, wont you? Theres a lot more snow up in the sky yet,
and by night were likely to have some of it.

Vicky promised. When she struck the trail to Bald Knob she discovered
that the snow was deeper than she had supposed. But there was a
well-beaten track as far as the shoulder of the ridge. Beyond that she
had to break a path for herself.

It was heavy work. She grew tired long before she reached the mine. But
she kept going rather than turn back. It was nearly two oclock when
Sorenson answered her hail.
