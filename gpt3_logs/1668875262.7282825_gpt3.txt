Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
XXI.


Annie stood with her husband at the top of the stairs until she
heard the street door shut upon Aubrey Cooke; then, recovering her
self-command, she turned and said, Wont you come in? and led the way
into her sitting-room.

Harry followed, and stood at first speechless with anger in the
middle of the small room, while his wife moved restlessly toward
the fireplace. Then, beginning to perceive that, for once, her
self-possession was no greater than his own, he found words.

So this is what your ambition, your love of work means!

What do you mean?

What do I mean? You know very well what I mean! Do you think I
couldnt see through the farce your oldest friend played to shield
you? Do you think I dont know that this was the first time he had ever
heard of me? When I told him my name, it was easy enough to see that
it meant nothing to him. Answer me this: did he or did he not know you
were married?

He was working himself up to a white heat of passion, and Annie feared
for the consequences of any admission she might make while he was in
this mood. She tried to delay explanation by going to him, taking his
hand, and attempting to draw him to a seat by the fire.

Dusk was coming on, and he could not clearly see her face as she
approached him with bent head, but he felt that the hands into which
she was trying to draw his were cold and trembling. He would not move
from where he stood; but, with a sudden, almost rough motion, he raised
her head and peered down into her averted eyes. She shrunk from the
unexpected ordeal, and tried to edge away from him with an involuntary
eagerness which incensed him still more against her.

Is this all the answer you have to give me? You cant meet my eyes,
you shrink away from my touch! Is this the welcome a good wife gives to
her husband? Annie, answer me! Did that man know you were married?

Harry, let me go! You are hurting me! I cannot answer you anything
until you let me go. See the mark you have left upon my wrist! How can
you be so brutal?

You are not going to put me off like that, said Harry, firmly. I
know how you women will wriggle out of a subject you dont like, if
you can. I am sorry if I have hurt you: you know very well I did not
mean to do that; but I will be answered. Now sit down and get quite
quiet and calm. I wont hurt you, whatever you say; but you must tell
me the whole truth, because, if you tell me any lies, I shall find them
out and be very angry about it.

His manner had grown calmer the moment he saw the red mark his strong
hand had made on his wifes wrist, and felt how utterly powerless in
his grasp the little creature was. He placed her gently in the very
chair she had tried to induce him to take, and then stood before her,
towering above her, and without turning his eyes again toward the chair
in which she sat, gravely and doggedly waiting.

Annie felt cowed. For the first time in their lives, the husband stood
in the position of the superior, and, as she sat guiltily there,
understanding clearly for the first time that her husband had just
right of complaint against her, and that, moreover, he was using that
right with consideration and manliness, she gave a shy look upward, as
if to see what change this inversion of their old attitudes toward each
other had wrought in Harrys handsome, careless, boyish face.

It was too dark for her to see very clearly what little of his profile
was shown in that position; she could only see that he stood very
still, that, if he felt impatience, he was keeping it under strong
control, and she began to feel dimly that in the argument which was
coming he would meet her for the first time upon equal terms. As she
still sat, with her head raised, looking up anxiously at him, he turned
and his eyes met hers.

Are you ready now? he asked, simply.

Ready for what? said she, impatiently.

Ready to answer some questions I have to ask you.

Of course I can answer any questions you please; but I dont see the
necessity of all this fuss about the matter. Whatever you have to ask I
could have answered a long time ago, said Annie, indifferently. But
if you like to play inquisitor and give yourself the airs of a judge,
why--its nothing to me!

Can we have the gas lighted? asked Harry. I cant see your face.
