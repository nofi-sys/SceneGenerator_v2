SCENE:
Everyone scattered like flushed quail, and the hairy enemy, unable to
make quick turns, charged harmlessly through like a bull. Abandoning
all pretense, it turned and came sliding back in another silent, deadly
rush. Again, the castaways dodged aside.

"He has such an endearing way of showing his friendliness!" Strike
gibed at his fiance.

But though there were elements of humor in being chased round and round
the space-boat, tiring muscles soon warned that the situation was no
joke.

"This can't go on indefinitely," Gerry finally gasped. "Someone'll
slip, or dodge a little too late. And if we retreat into the ship,
it'll just mean a siege. If that blasted Dacres had only left us a
weapon--"

She might have been a lady Aladdin, speaking the magic formula,
for the lifeboat opened and Barrows, grinning uncertainly, tossed
an improvised contraption to Strike. It consisted of two scalpels,
fastened with wires from the control panel to a three-foot metal piece
of weather-stripping ripped from the doorsill, to form a spear.

"Best we could do on short notice," Barrows apologized, then retreated
precipitately, as the shaggy, faceless nemesis charged raveningly
against the closing porte.

As the Thing reeled back from the shock, Strike deftly moved in
with his crude weapon, slashing for the abdomen. The result was so
completely devastating that Strike was dumbfounded.

The razor-sharp little knives went in as if through butter, and when
they were withdrawn, a torrent of grayish fluid spouted forth almost
endlessly, as if the strange creature were filled with the stuff to the
exclusion of any kind of organs.

Eventually, the rank flood ceased, and the enemy collapsed like an
empty glove, dead. The victory was so absolute--the weird animal had
been so utterly ferocious, animated solely by the two emotions of
cunning and hate. It had been defeated so easily--that bewilderment
took the place of triumph. Everyone gathered round Strike and his
trophy.

"Funny stuff," Kranz said, pointing to the great puddle of vital fluid,
as yet unaffected by the temperature. "Wonder what it is?"

"Must be anti-freeze," Gerry hazarded.

"Be interesting to examine the beast," Strike said slowly.

He and Kranz exchanged a long look and, by common consent, seized the
shrunken carcass and bore it into the lifeboat. They could rig up a
rough laboratory there, putter around for hours with the smelly corpse,
and be quite happy.

Kranz was a fiend for chemical analysis. He would sample the Styx as
Charon rowed him across. Gerry, whose interest in strange creatures
was confined to live ones with commercial value, shrugged it off. It
was one of the few times in her life she missed the point.

Seven times, Neptune's pale bulk popped over the horizon to make its
swift journey across the sky before Strike, smiling like a cat in a
bird-cage, invited Gerry into the lifeboat.

"Interesting beastie," he observed. "Skin as thin as paper, despite the
shaggy coat. No circulatory system. Somehow that mess of fluid takes
the place of blood--has corpuscles and things in it, too. Rudimentary
organs of some kind about where you'd expect to find eyes. In the
absence of a Latin scholar, we've named it _Apod Shaggius_--footless
and hairy. 'Shaggie' for short."

"That hardly accounts for the self-satisfied smile," Gerry said
shrewdly.

Strike grinned wider.

"We analyzed the fluid," he said. "It's a chlorinated compound, as you
might expect--basically perchlorethylene."

"And so?"

"Kranz thinks it would be easy to convert the stuff, right inside the
creature's body, into hexachlorethane, without any immediate harm. Just
a few injections."

"Now there's a brilliant experiment!" Gerry simmered exasperatedly.
"And at a time like this, marooned at the outer extremities of the
System, our days numbered! Why, for heaven's sake?"

She still did not see the point, nor did any of the others except
Kranz, and Strike found perverse delight in that fact. Gerry had kept
still about Triton's peculiar balance of centrifugal and gravitational
forces while she wasn't sure.
