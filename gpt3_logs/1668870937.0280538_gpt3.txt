Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
Mike McCarty heard it while stripping the harness from his horses
backs in Shannons stables; Tim Burns was told of it while still on his
way from work; and it was the first thing that fell upon the ears of
Danny Casey as he entered his mothers house.

Marys dyin, trembled upon every lip that had smiled in answer to
her kindness; and as the night grew old, a hush seemed to fall over
the district; the very moon, as it sailed across the sky, attended by
myriads of stars, seemed to blink solemnly down, and ponder sadly.

Yes, the serene, white soul was passing; the shadow of the death
angels wings had fallen across the bed where Mary lay. Larry sat near
the window, his arm thrown along the back of the chair, his forehead
resting upon it; Rosie, the only other person in the room, wiped the
death damp from the pale brow, her eyes bright with tears.

Dont take it so hard, Larry, whispered the sick girl. It had to
come, you know, and youll be happy, afterward.

Happy! With a return of the old bare life--the rough, purposeless life
that she had made bloom with new thoughts? He would drift back to the
old conditions; there would be nothing to keep him from it when her
gentle influence had relaxed. And that afterward of which she spoke
so often, and so hopefully! It would be black and barren enough, his
heart whispered to him--she would be where her voice could not reach
him and he would be alone with his sorrow.

A picture of the crucifixion hung upon the wall; a slanting ray from
the dim light brought out the worlds great tragedy with piteous
distinctness. But the lesson brought no consolation to Larry. He looked
at the picture with vacant eyes, for his brain was numb, and he could
think of nothing but his impending loss. Philosophy is a meaningless
word to such as he; for they who grapple with poverty, and go wrestling
through a gloom from birth to death, find it hard to submit.

Are you crying, Rosie? asked the weak voice. Dont, dear; you
promised not to, you know.

Rosies face rested upon the pillow beside her, and Mary stroked the
tear-wet cheek, softly.

Im sorry that I didnt see it long ago, said she, sadly; sorry
for you, and Larry. But it wont be long now, and you both will be
very happy. Her voice trembled a little but she continued, bravely:
Promise me that you will think of me sometimes, Rosie?

Ill never forget you, Mary, sobbed the girl.

And dont let Larry forget me, either, eagerly. And try and be a
good wife to him, Rosie.

Both Rosie and the young man lifted their heads quickly and looked at
each other, searchingly.

From far down the street came a faint, musical drone as of minor voices
singing; the bell of St. Michaels boomed the hour solemnly; quick
footsteps went by the house, grew faint and then died away.

Do you think, Rosies voice trembled in dread, that shes dyin,
Larry?

He had approached the bed and was looking down at the pale face framed
in the dark, loose hair. She smiled up into his eyes.

She will be good to you, Larry; she has a kind heart and will be a
better wife to you than I could have been.

Mary!

You were kind to me when I was left alone, Larry; you would have
married me because you felt sorry for me. But youll be free now; and I
have prayed that shell be as happy as I was--before I knew!

Dont talk like that, Mary! It was you that was sorry for me! It was
you-- but his voice broke in a dry sob.

Hush! a pleading look crept into her eyes. Dont let anything stand
in the way of your happiness, Larry; dont let any thoughts of me--any
regrets--keep you apart. Promise me that!

He knelt and covered his face with his hands, the deep, hard sobs
racking him from head to foot; and as he made no answer, Mary turned
her eyes upon Rosie.

You will promise, I know, said she.

Oh, Mary, Mary I cant! Please dont ask me!

But seeing the look of sorrow that crept into the death-dulled eyes,
she added frantically--despairingly, thinking of nothing save the
soothing of her friend.
