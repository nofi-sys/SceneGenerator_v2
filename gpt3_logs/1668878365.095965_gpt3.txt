SCENE:
They turned the canoe over and piled branches at its sides, thus
keeping the blankets and rifles dry, while they stood shivering
under the partial shelter of a tree. They felt that they were as
secure there as any place, though the lightning flashed almost
continuously. One bolt struck a quakermast not a hundred feet from
where they were standing, but it did no more damage than searing off
the bark. The thunder, following the flash, was deafening.

When the rain had abated somewhat, they ran toward the river. Pops
description of it after a storm had not been exaggerated. The
current had increased tenfold, and it fairly roared as it dashed
over the rocks. Yellow foam was tossed high upon the shore.

That queers our plan of reaching Jake Trummers place to-night,
Teddy said grimly. No one but a fool would launch a boat in that.
He watched a huge tree limb go floating by. Are the rapids worse
than this, Pop? Do you think this storm will make them much more
dangerous? Will--

Take it easy, son, Pop chuckled. Im no bureau of information.
Youve seen those rapids, havent you, Teddy?

Yes; but it was a long time ago. I forget just how swift they are.

Well, theyre bad enough, but not quite this bad. It is possible to
shoot em in a heavy canoe like we got. Now what else was it you
asked?

Do you think this rain will make em worse?

It might. Theres no tellin. But we wont take a chance on em
to-night, at any rate. Weve got to wait till morning. Now lets
have a look at the stuff that was placed under the boat.

The rain had ceased by this time, and now the sun came forth in all
its glory for a farewell flash before night settled down. The boys
turned the canoe over carefully and discovered that the rifles and
blankets were as dry as before the storm. This lightened their
spirits somewhat, for it meant that they could at least spend a
fairly comfortable night.

They fretted a good deal at the delay, but there was no help for it,
and they set about making camp. It took them some time to get a fire
going, for they had hard work to find dry wood, but finally picked
up enough to start a small blaze, sufficient to warm them.

Guess we wont be at the grazing ground much before dad, at this
rate, Roy declared, munching on some bacon and bread. Golly! I
hope those Durhams stick around a while longer.

Say! I wonder if that storm could have started another slide? Bug
Eye questioned suddenly.

Snakes, I never thought about that! replied Roy. Suffering tripe,
what a break it would be to get there and find the cows all in the
river, drowned! And if that waddy Nick told us about spoke the
truth, that may have happened. That will hit dad hard. Our best cows
are in that bunch.

Aw, forget it, Teddy returned. I cant believe that, Roy. It
doesnt stand to reason. Cows wander all over the lot, and theres
not one chance in a thousand that theyd wait for a landslide to
fall on em. They may have been in danger when that stranger came
through, but that was three or four days ago. Theyre just as likely
to be a mile away by this time.

Hope youre right, Roy mused. And when you look at it that way, I
guess you are. The story does sound fishy. Golly! I wish those
blamed trees would stop dripping cold water down my neck.

With a last parting glow, the sun sank out of sight and darkness
followed fast. The boys had established themselves some distance
back from the river, but its roaring song could be plainly heard
through the black night. Like all good campers, they had brought
with them a small spade, and now found a use for it. They dug up the
soft earth in a trench about their camp until a layer of dry sand
made a comfortable sleeping place for them. But all were rather
restless, and none of them wished to turn in immediately.

Gradually the voice of the river grew fainter. The torrent was
subsiding. Bug Eye and Pop had seated themselves on a log near the
fire, and were puffing away on pipes, waiting for sleepiness to come
upon them. Roy fed the blaze until he got it going to his
satisfaction, then called to Teddy:

What say we have one more look at the stream before we turn in? I
want to see that the canoe is pulled up far enough. Want to come
along?

Teddy stretched himself, and yawned.
