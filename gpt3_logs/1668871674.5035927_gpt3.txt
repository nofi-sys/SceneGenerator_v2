SCENE:
IV.

_A WILD ADVENTURE--ARCHIE'S PRIDE RECEIVES A FALL._

It happened--I was going to say at the end of the other page--that in
a few weeks' time Mr. Winslow paid his promised visit to Burley New
Farm, as the three friends called it.

Great preparations had been made beforehand because Etheldene was
coming with her father, and was accompanied by a black maid.  Both
Etheldene and her maid had been accommodated with a dray, and when
Sarah, with her cheeks like ripe cherries, and her eyes like sloes,
showed the young lady to her bedroom, Etheldene was pleased to
express her delight in no measured terms.  She had not expected
anything like this.  Real mattresses, with real curtains, a real
sofa, and real lace round the looking-glass.

"It is almost too good for Bush-life," said Etheldene; "but I am so
pleased, Mrs. Cooper; and everything is as clean and tidy as my own
rooms in Sydney.  Father, do come and see all this, and thank Mrs.
Cooper prettily."

Somewhat to Archie's astonishment a horse was led round next morning
for Etheldene, and she appeared in a pretty dark habit, and was
helped into the saddle, and gathered up the reins, and looked as calm
and self-possessed as a princess could have done.

It was Gentleman Craig who was the groom, and a gallant one he made.
For the life of him Archie could not help envying the man for his
excessive coolness, and would have given half of his cattle--those
vith the bold "A.B.'s" on them--to have been only half as handsome.

Never mind.  Archie is soon mounted, and cantering away by the young
lady's side, and feeling so buoyant and happy all over that he would
not have exchanged places with a king on a throne.

"Oh, yes," said Etheldene, laughing, as she replied to a question of
Archie's, "I know nearly everything about cattle, and sheep too!
But," she added, "I'm sure you are clever among them already."

Archie felt the blood mount to his forehead; but he took off his
broad hat and bowed for the compliment, almost as prettily as
Gentleman Craig could have done himself.

Now, there is such a thing as being too clever, and it was trying to
be clever that led poor Archie to grief that day.

The young man was both proud and pleased to have an opportunity of
showing Etheldene round the settlement, all the more so that there
was to be a muster of the herds that day, and neighbour-squatters had
come on horseback to assist.  This was a kind of a love-darg which
was very common in Queensland a few years ago, and probably is to
this day.

Archie pointed laughingly towards the stock-whip Etheldene carried.
He never for a moment imagined it was in the girl's power to use or
manage such an instrument.

"That is a pretty toy, Miss Winslow," he said.

"Toy, do you call it, sir?" said this young Diana, pouting prettily.
"It is only a lady's whip, for the thong is but ten feet long.  But
listen."

It flew from her hands as she spoke, and the sound made every animal
within hearing raise head and sniff the air.

"Well," said Archie, "I hope you won't run into any danger."

"Oh," she exclaimed, "danger is fun!"  And she laughed right merrily,
and looked as full of life and beauty as a bird in spring-time.

Etheldene was tall and well-developed for her age, for girls in this
strange land very soon grow out of their childhood.

Archie had called her Diana in his own mind, and before the day was
over she certainly had given proof that she well merited the title.

New herds had arrived, and had for one purpose or another to be
headed into the stock yards.  This is a task of no little difficulty,
and to-day being warm these cattle appeared unusually fidgety.  Twos
and threes frequently stampeded from the mob, and went determinedly
dashing back towards the creek and forest, so there was plenty of
opportunities for anyone to show off his horsemanship.  Once during a
chase like this Archie was surprised to see Etheldene riding neck and
neck for a time with a furious bull.  He trembled for her safety as
he dashed onwards to her assistance.  But crack, crack, crack went
the brave girl's whip; she punished the runaway most unmercifully,
and had succeeded in turning him ere her Northumbrian cavalier rode
up.  A moment more and the bull was tearing back towards the herd he
had left, a stockman or two following close behind.
