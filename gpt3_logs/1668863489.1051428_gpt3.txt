SCENE:
XVI


LIANE did not use empty threats. She was, as she was fond of
proclaiming, a good-natured woman, and she never went out of her way
to do anyone harm unless she meant to. Margot and Jean had defied her
and disappeared, and she was willing for the moment to let the matter
rest there. But they made the mistake of reappearing. She read notices
of Margots singing and she heard from her friends in the musical world
that her little Baron was achieving something. He had played for one of
Toriallis pupils, he was getting a name as an accompanist; and he was
still with Margot. This she gathered directly from Margots ill-spelt
appeal to her. She was gratified by the appeal, and she would have been
immensely touched by Jeans death. Jean, however, did not die--he went
so far as to recover without renewing the appeal.

One must do something, said Liane, during the temporary absence of
one of Jeans successors. I will call upon the uncle.

Madame de Brances found Romain at home and alone. Madame, the servants
told her at the door, was away for a week, the Comte, however, had
not accompanied her, he had a slight indisposition, but he would most
certainly see Madame.

Romains indisposition was of so slight a nature that it only consisted
of an inability to do what he disliked. He told Madame de Brances that
the thought of a country visit had made him ill, and that the only
remedy which suggested itself to him was to remain in town.

For me, said Liane, lifting her eyes to the ceiling, I adore the
country!

So I should suppose, agreed Romain with his enigmatical smile.
Madame gives me that impression.

If my life would only permit, continued Madame de Brances, I would
stay there for months at a time. How it would rest me! I can imagine
days in the green fields--it brings tears to my eyes.

It would to mine, said Romain. But I prefer to keep them dry.

If that were possible! sighed Liane.

Romain bowed. He was intensely amused at this interview; he had already
the honour of a slight acquaintance with the famous actress, but he
did not for one moment suppose that she had called to renew it.

Talking of the country, said Liane, drawing her long soft gloves
through her fingers, brings one back to your little nephew. You are so
alike, Monsieur, one would suppose him to be a younger brother.

Romain bowed again.

I should have said myself, he murmured, my elder brother, but do not
let me interrupt you!

_Pauvre petit_ Jean! said Liane in her best tragic manner. There I
blame myself! It is, in fact, to blame myself--to make, as it were, a
little confession that I come here to-day.

Ah! said Romain. May I ask, Madame, if you come to confess his sins
or your own?

Altogether my own, said Liane, with a little sigh. I have been
unconscionably cruel to him!

Ah, then, it was Jean who tired first! thought Romain to himself.

_Chre_ Madame, when are not beautiful women cruel? he said
aloud. It is their chief quality; even their kindness one suffers
from--probably more, he added to himself.

Indeed I meant to be kind, said Liane quickly. I thought, Here is
this poor young man, inexperienced, bored with his bank, with a great
talent (that I most emphatically declare he really has, Monsieur, a
unique talent). I am an artist to my finger-tips, think of me what you
like. I could not resist the temptation, I persuaded him to forsake the
Bank. I threw him with both hands into the world of music, all this
time without dreaming of the poor boys emotions--they were, I thought,
only gratitude. Monsieur le Comte, they were not!

At his age what could you expect? laughed Romain.

I never yet knew a grateful young man; indeed, I would rather not.

Liane brushed aside Romains comments; she leaned forward in her chair.

She is getting a little too old to be so dramatic; it tires one,
Romain said to himself.
