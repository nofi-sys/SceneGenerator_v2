Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
Show us now, Arthur demanded.

The three boys started in the direction of the barn.

Lets go too, Rosie whispered. Isnt it a joke to think of boys
trying to make beds? Id like to see the bed after Harold has finished
with it.

The girls tagged the boys; followed them upstairs into the barn.

At once Harold began in the most business-like way to strip the bed. It
was apparent that on arising he had pulled the covers back to air. Then
with swift, efficient movements, he began to re-make it.

Goodness! Rosie exclaimed humbly in a moment, I cant make a bed as
well as that. Im going to learn too.

Indeed, the bed looked like a mathematical problem which had just been
solved, and as Harold proceeded to clean up the room in the way he
had learned at camp, the others followed him with respectful glances.
Harold tidied the three chiffoniers and the three closets. When he
finished, the room had a look of military perfection.

Now, he commanded, Arthur you make your bed and Dicky you make
yours; Ill supervise the job.

Im going right back to my room and re-make my bed, Harold, Maida
declared. It looks as though somebody had driven an automobile over
it.

I will too, admitted the humbled Rosie. Think of having a boy teach
you how to make a bed!

The boys rejoined the girls after a while and again they went over
their plans. In the midst of it all, Granny Flynn came in to see what
was keeping them so quiet. They showed her the typewritten schedules
and she approved them highly. They ought to work like a charm, she
averred.

And indeed, it seemed as though her prophecy were a true one. About
the same hour the next morning, twin alarm-clocks rang out; one in the
barn, another in Maidas room. Very soon after, a sleepy boy--Arthur
had volunteered for the first day in the garden--emerged from the barn;
three sleepy girls from the house. They weeded busily for half an hour.
In the meantime, another sleepy boy was rolling the tennis court which
had been hosed the night before. Then came breakfast. Immediately after
breakfast, rooms were made speckless.

With the girls, this continued to be a kind of game. They not only
prided themselves on keeping their chambers clean, but they actually
tried to match the flowers they placed there to the chintzes and
wallpapers.

Its fun to take care of these darling rooms, Rosie declared again
and again. Theyre so little I feel as though we ought to buy a dolls
broom and a dolls carpet-sweeper and a dolls dust-pan and brush. I
never saw such sweet furniture in all my life, and how I love the roof
slanting down like that!

I feel that way too--exactly as though I were putting a dolls house
in order, Laura coincided happily.

As for the boys--they bothered with no flowers. Indeed a military
plainness prevailed in the barn. This of course meant also a military
neatness to which no one of them was accustomed but Harold. Harold
constituted himself critic-in-chief. And he proved a stern critic
indeed. He would not permit the sheets on the bed to deviate one hairs
breadth from perfect horizontality or absolute verticality. A bit of
paper on the floor elicited an immediate rebuke. He even stipulated the
exact spots on the chiffonier-tops where brush, comb and mirror were to
be kept and he saw that the other boys kept them there. The victims of
his passion for military order had to roll their pajamas in a certain
way and put them in a certain place. A similar neatness characterized
the closets. Coats and trousers had to be hung on special hangers; ties
on special hooks. As for bureau drawers--Harold maintained that there
was a place for everything and woe to Dicky or Arthur when everything
was not in its place.

Immediately after the rooms were done in the morning came errands. The
first morning, Granny let the Big Six do all the marketing, even what
could have been done over the telephone; so that they could get to know
where the shops were. They proceeded on their bicycles, with Maida for
a guide, to Satuit Center. Maida took them to the Post Office; to the
butcher; the grocer; the coalman; the wood-man; the hardware shop; the
ice cream establishment--even to the little dry-goods shops and to the
cobbler. She introduced them to all these village authorities.

After to-day, Maida explained, well have to do only part of
Grannys marketing for her. And only one of us need attend to it.
