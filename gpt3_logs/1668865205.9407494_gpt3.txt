SCENE:
An inquest! stammered Hindes. But surely there is no need of our
undergoing such a painful ordeal? Why, it will nearly kill Mr Crampton.
My dear friend, you must not think of attending it.

Not go? cried the old man, suddenly rousing himself from the lethargy
into which he had temporarily fallen. What are you saying, Hindes? Of
course we must go. Dont you see how this has come about? That villain
has murdered her; he stole her from me first, and then he killed her.
Who else would have pushed her over the cliff? My poor butchered lamb!
my pretty Jenny! my beautiful, innocent daughter! Oh! but we will be
avenged on him, never fear; well see him brought to justice and give a
hand to set him swinging. My poor child! my murdered darling! I can see
how the whole damnable trick was done!

You must not heed what he says, whispered the doctor to Henry Hindes,
the shock has been too much for him, though I broke it as gently as
I could. You must get him to bed and give him a sleeping draught, but
dont listen to any nonsense he may talk. There never was a clearer
case of misadventure. The poor girl went out on the cliffs alone and
fell over them. The coroner can bring in no other verdict.

But why, then, need we attend? asked Hindes, with quivering lips; it
will be a fearful trial for all of us. What do we need more than your
assurance of the calamity that has befallen?

You may need nothing more, Mr Hindes, but the law needs your
deposition as to what you know of the matter.

I know nothing--nothing-- repeated Hindes.

Then you can say so, answered Dr MColl, shortly.

No, we know nothing as yet, exclaimed Mr Crampton, eagerly, but we
_will_ know it. We will not rest till we have got at the bottom of this
infamy. If ever a poor child was murdered, my girl has been.

Papa, papa, wailed Mrs Crampton from the sofa, dont speak like
that, or you will break my heart.

Ay, my poor woman, said her husband, youve plenty of cause to
greet. Theyve taken your ewe lamb from you. You had but one left, and
the Lord let her be done to death, without stretching forth His hand
to save. And yet they say He cares for us! But the murderer shall be
brought to justice, never fear. Ill see to that.

Oh! if he goes on like this hell kill me, sobbed the tortured mother.

Mr Crampton, interposed the doctor, we all feel deeply for you in
this sore affliction, but you must not bring unmeaning accusations
against anyone. There is no question of how your poor daughter came by
her death. It was an unfortunate accident, nothing more.

I know better, sir, I know better, replied Mr Crampton. You cant
deceive me. My lamb was murdered, and may Gods deepest curse rest--

Oh! stop, stop, cried Henry Hindes, holding up his hand. It is
terrible to hear you blaspheming in this manner, without the least
authority to do so. It will not ease your own pain, Crampton, and may
add to it hereafter. For your wifes sake and your own, let me take you
to your room, where you can think over this terrible news in quiet.
Trust in God, Crampton, trust in God. There is nothing else to be done
in a time like the present.

But the old man, usually so acquiescent in all that his partner said,
turned round on him, on this occasion, in a fury.

Dont preach to me, Hindes! he exclaimed, angrily. Its all very
well for you to talk of trusting in God, whilst your own kids are
safe at home, but lose five, my boy, lose five--three boys and two
girls--and set all your hopes and chances of happiness on the remaining
one, and have her murdered before your eyes, and then talk of trusting
in God. Youre a hypocrite, sir, a d--d hypocrite.

Mr Crampton, said Henry Hindes, deeply wounded, I never thought to
hear you speak to me like this.

For shame, John, for shame! exclaimed his wife, rousing herself for
a moment. What are you thinking of? Mr Hindes, too, who loved our
darling almost as if she had been his own child, and who has always
been so kind to her and us all.

Ah, well, well, said the old man in a tired voice, I suppose I was
wrong, and I ask your pardon for it, Hindes. But I dont seem to quite
know what I am saying. My head keeps going round so. I suppose you
are right, and I should be better by myself for a few hours. Give me
your arm, and take me to my own room. I leave this gentleman in your
hands, Hindes. See that he is attended to, and arrange everything for
our going down to Dover. Good-morning, sir! and with that Mr Crampton
rose, and, leaning on the arm of his friend, quitted the apartment.
