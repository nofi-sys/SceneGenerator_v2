SCENE:
That fellow Dunton might take a few lessons in manners from you,
lieutenant. He wants em badly.

Before they reached the cabin, Fotheringay stopped them, saying:

So you have had trouble with Dunton? I expected it, and I am sorry
that any unpleasantness should have arisen. However, it is not for me
to say anything against a brother officer. Let it pass. I take this
opportunity to tell you that Captain Raggett is in a very bad humor.
He has had despatches from the Admiralty finding fault with him for
not being more active in harassing the shore towns. There is trouble
hatching for your people and it will not help matters if you cross him
in any way. Captain Mayo, you will excuse me, but I think you are a
little hotheaded. You had better let Captain Knowles do the talking.

Thank you kindly, Mr. Fotheringay, said Hoppy heartily, Win
certainly is a smoother talker than I am; never much of what you call
a diplomat, myself. But whatever happens, we want you to remember that
we are grateful for your kindness, and if all Britishers were like you,
there would be no trouble.

And I, Mr. Fotheringay, said Win, repeat what I said to Hoppy
yesterday, Damn this war! And now more than ever when it makes us the
enemies of a man like you.

You are very good to say so, replied the officer.

In response to a knock at the captains door, a gruff voice bade them
enter. Captain Richard Raggett arose from his chair when Fotheringay
saluted and introduced the unwilling guests. The captains keen eyes
searched the faces of the prisoners as he motioned them to be seated.

Post-Captain Richard Raggett of the Royal Navy was a stout man of about
sixty years of age. Old Dick Raggett, as he was familiarly known
throughout the service, was an officer of the school that gave Britain
such sailors as Rodney, Nelson, Collingwood, and others whose names are
inseparably connected with the story of Englands glory on the high
seas. He had fought under his countrys flag in every quarter of the
globe and for nearly half a century he had served his king with devoted
loyalty, always obeying orders no matter what those orders might be.
In battle he was unrelenting, but he was never known to press unfairly
a beaten foe. He had no liking for his present duty on the coast of
Massachusetts. There was no glory in bullying defenceless villagers
and he had not exerted himself overmuch in the operations against Cape
Cod. But London had reminded him that there was a state of war between
the United States and Great Britain and that the government expected
some positive results from the blockade of the New England coast.
Raggett was stung by the sarcasm of the reminder. He knew his enemies
at headquarters were at work to discredit him and he was determined to
outwit them at any hazard.

He was, then, in no amiable mood as he addressed the Cape men:

So you have been running the blockade in a whaleboat? Pretty small
business for shipmasters like you?

Shipmasters without a ship, Captain Raggett, and until captured
engaged in bringing necessaries of life from Boston to our town,
replied Captain Knowles.

By G----, sir! cried Raggett with the suspicion of a smile, your
people have a pretty good idea of what are necessaries of life. I find
that your cargo mostly consisted of good Jamaica rum.

This rather upset Win, but Hoppy was equal to the occasion.

Its like this, Captain Raggett, said he; theres been quite a lot
of sickness in the place, and we old sailors know theres nothing can
break up a cold like the old-fashioned cure of rum and molasses.

Well, Im afraid the invalids will have to suffer this trip.

Looks that way, Captain Raggett, assented Hoppy dolefully.

Now, my men, said Raggett, you know I have been very lenient about
this business. Its not the sort of warfare Im used to. But its got
to stop now. Ive got myself into hot water with the authorities in
London on account of my leniency and I dont mind telling you that I
dont like being reprimanded by fellows who never went a mile to sea
in the whole course of their clerkly lives. But that has nothing to do
with the matter at present. Dick Raggett has got orders and, by George,
hes going to obey them! I have had scouts out for you for some time,
and Im going to hold you until ransomed.

Then that will be forever! exclaimed Hoppy. Theres no one to ransom
us, Captain Raggett. Of course, you can confiscate our boat and cargo,
and hold us prisoners, but if you fix the price too high for our means,
then that fixes us so far as we are concerned.

I must make an example of your capture, replied Raggett, because you
two are the most daring and successful of all the runners. But that
doesnt mean that my terms cant be met. I confess I admire your pluck
and resourcefulness.
