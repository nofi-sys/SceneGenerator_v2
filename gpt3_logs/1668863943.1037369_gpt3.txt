Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
None of the women at the table took much interest in the talk that
followed. Mrs. Blair saw instinctively that Blairs passion for horses
was being powerfully stimulated by Skeltons presence and talk about
the Campdown course, which she secretly considered to be the bane
of her life. But she was too proud to let any one--Skelton least of
all--see how it troubled her. She even submitted to be drawn into the
conversation, which the men at the table were too well bred to leave
the women out of, for by little references and joking allusions they
were beguiled into it. Blair teased Sylvia about her unfailing faith
in a certain bay horse with a long tail, on account of which she had
lost sundry pairs of gloves. Mrs. Shapleigh reminded Mr. Shapleigh of
a promise he had made her that she should one day drive four horses to
her carriage.

I said four horses to your hearse, my dear, cried old Tom. I always
promised you the finest funeral ever seen in the county, and, by Jove,
you shall have it if I have to mortgage every acre Ive got to do it!

Old wretch! whispered Elizabeth to Mr. Conyers, while Jack Blair
called out good-naturedly:

I swear, if you hadnt the best wife in the world, you would have been
strangled long years ago.

I daresay I would, answered old Tom frankly. In those robust days
gentlemen used stronger language than in the present feeble time, and
nobody was at all shocked at either Mr. Shapleighs remark or Jack
Blairs commentary. There was a jovial good humour about old Tom
which took the sting out of his most outrageous speeches. But as the
talk about racing flowed on, Elizabeth Blair grew paler and paler.
Jack Blairs fever was upon him, and Skelton, whether consciously or
not, was fanning the flame. Skelton said, in a very modest way--for
he was too great a man in the community to need to be anything but
modest--that his interests in racing being much greater than ever, as
he was then on the spot, he should double his subscription to the club.
As it was known that his subscription was already large, this created a
flutter among the gentlemen.

Of course I cant double _my_ subscription in the debonair manner of
Mr. Skelton, said Blair with an easy smile, but I dont mind saying
that I shall raise it very considerably.

At that moment Mrs. Blair caught Skeltons eyes fixed on her
pityingly--so she imagined--and it spurred her to show him that she was
not an object of commiseration, and that Jack Blair had no domestic rod
in pickle for him on account of that last speech.

Now, if you change your mind, she said playfully to her husband,
dont lay it on your wife, and say she wouldnt let you, for here I
sit as meek as a lamb, not making the slightest protest against any of
these schemes, which, however, I dont pretend to understand in the
least.

My dear, cried Blair, his face slightly flushed with wine and
excitement, dont try to pretend, at this late day, that you do not
dragoon me. My subjugation has been county talk ever since that night
you slipped out of the garden gate and rode off with me in search of a
parson.

A magnetic shock ran through everybody present at this. Blair, in
saying it, glanced maliciously at Skelton. _That_ paid him back for
Oriole beating Miss Betsy, and Jack-o-Lantern romping in ahead of
Paymaster, and various other defeats that his horse or two had met
with from the black and yellow.

In an instant the talk began again very merrily and promptly. Blair
looked audaciously at his ease, but Skelton was not a whit behind him
in composure. He turned, smiling, to Sylvia, and said:

How all this talk must bore you!

Sylvia felt furious with Blair. They had not asked Skelton there to
insult him. Therefore she threw an extra softness into her smile, as
she replied:

It is very nice to talk about something else occasionally. I long to
hear you talk about your travels.

My travels are not worth talking about, answered Skelton in the same
graceful way; but I have some very pretty prints that I would like to
show you. I hope you will repeat your interesting visit of some years
ago to Deerchase--some time soon.

You are cruel to remind me of that visit, said Sylvia, with her
most charmingly coquettish air. I have the most painfully distinct
recollection of it, even to finding fault with the little yellow room
because it was not as fine as the rest of the house.

Skelton concluded that neither a course of travel, a system of
education, nor a knowledge of the world were necessary to teach Miss
Sylvia how to get into the good graces of the other sex. In the midst
of it all, Bulstrode, who heard everything and was constitutionally
averse to holding his tongue, whispered to Conyers:


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

The scene takes place at a dinner party, where the conversation turns to horse racing. Jack Blair teases Sylvia about her faith in a certain horse, and old Tom Shapleigh jokingly promises his wife a grand funeral. Elizabeth Blair grows paler and paler as the conversation continues, and Skelton eventually says that he will double his subscription to the horse racing club. This prompts Jack Blair to say that he will also raise his subscription, much to the amusement of the other guests. Mrs. Blair playfully chides her husband for his racing obsession, and the conversation turns to Skelton's travels. Sylvia flirts with Skelton, and Bulstrode whispers to Conyers that the whole thing is a 'spectacle'.
