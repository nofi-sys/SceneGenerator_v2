SCENE:
II

_Ding, dong, ding-el, ding-el, dong,
Listen to the echo in the dell,
Hurry, little children, Sunday morn,
There goes the old Church bell._

HARRIGAN.


IT was Sunday morning. The iron heart of the bell that hung in the
tower of St. Michaels beat against its brazen ribs, and the clangour
went rioting over the housetops. Streams of people, dressed in their
Sunday best, picked their way across the railroad toward the sound;
heavy faces peered through bedroom windows and sleep-dry lips murmured
curses at the noise; a shifting engine panted heavily as it dragged a
milk train over the rails, and spat cinders into the face of day.

In the kitchen of a squat, shabby building fronting on the railroad, a
lean, yellow-faced old woman sat beside the range, nursing her knees
and drawing at a black clay pipe. Another, almost her counterpart, was
sweeping the floor with the worn stump of a broom.

God be good till uz, Ellen! suddenly exclaimed the first. What are
yez about?

What talk have ye, Bridget?

Sure ye wur as near as a hair till swapin the bit av dust out av the
dure!

Divil a fear av me. Is it swape the luck from the house Id be doin?

Ellen scraped up the sweepings. There do be bad luck enough about the
place, she continued, as she slid the dust into the fire and watched
it burn, the flame lighting up her old, faded face, her dirty white
cap, her bony, large-veined hands. Malachi tells me that the bizness
do be poorly.

Little wonder, declared Bridget, knocking the ashes from her pipe
and laying it carefully on the top of a tin at the back of the stove.
I knowd what ud come av havin the son av a Know-nothin glosterin
about the place! Sure the curse av God is on the loike!

True for yez, assented her sister. Owld Larkin wur the spit av the
owld felly himself; he wur a Derry man an as black a Presbyterian as
iver cried To h--l wid the Pope!

Ellen took up the hot pipe and charged it from the tin, shaking her
head ominously.

Ah, the Orange thafe! piped the other. Well do I raymember him,
years ago, at the riots at the Nanny-Goat Market, that stood beyant
there where the railroad is. Sure it wur him that put the divil in
their heads till burn down St. Michaels; an wid me own two eyes I see
him shoutin an laffin as the cross tumbled intill the street!

Ellen made a hurried sign of the cross and muttered some words in
Gaelic.

An they say, whispered she, awed, that he barked loike a dog iver
after!

Sorra the lies in it, avic. Owld Mrs. Flannagan, that lived nixt dure
till him, towld me, wid her own two lips, that it wur so. Bud he always
said it wur asthma he wur after havin.

Oh, the robber! It wur himself that cud twist tings till serve his
turn. More like it wur the divil in him, cryin till be let out.

An dyez raymember at the toime av the riots, Ellen, whin he stood be
the fince, overight our back yard, wid Foleys musket, waitin for any
av uz till pop out our heads?

Ellen, through some mischance, had swallowed some of the rank pipe
smoke, and she gasped and strangled, with waving hands and protruding
eyes.

Well do I, asthore, she panted between her fits of coughing. Oh, the
Cromell!

Bridget, cried a voice from the storeroom in front, have ye not me
bit av breakfast ready? Its late for Mass Ill be iv yez dont stir
yezself, woman.

Malachi OHara stood in his shop among his stock in trade. About him
were heaped the rakings of low auction rooms and pawnbrokers sales;
stacks of half-worn clothing lay upon the counter; the shelves were
loaded with crockery, oil lamps, plaster of paris images, table
cutlery, clocks, fly-specked pictures and a heterogeneous mass of
battered, greasy and utterly useless articles for which it would be
impossible to find names. In the window hung a banjo with two broken
strings; a family Bible, its pages held open by a set of steel knuckle
dusters lay just below, and it was garnished on all sides with
old-fashioned silver watches, seal rings, black jacks and so on down
the list of articles that clutter such establishments.
