SCENE:
VI


The young man who flung into the embassy as if he owned it was small,
round and jolly, with a twinkle in his eye that persisted even when, as
at the moment in question, he was fuming with anger and disgust.

Give me a drink, for Gods sake, Rutile, he cried. Ive been talking
to Ouro Preto and I need a bracer. Of all the--

Hello, Risdon! Topham stepped forward and held out his hand. Hello!
old man! he repeated, smilingly.

By all the gods! Walter Topham! Where in thunder did you come from?
He grabbed the others hand and wrung it warmly. Say! he went on,
Weve simply got to celebrate this! Rutile. Are you going to order
those drinks, or shall I?

Rutile was again looking through the papers brought by Topham. Without
raising his eyes he reached over and pounded a bell. Shut up or talk
to Topham till I finish this, he ordered.

What you reading? A love letter?

Lord! no! Nothing half so important. Only some stuff from the State
Department.

Oh! That! Let it go! He turned back to Topham. By George old man! I
havent seen you since I bilged from the U. S. N. A. Whod a-thought we
three would ever meet here? You, the savey man of the class; Rutile,
the--the--Ill be darned if I know what; and me the only one of the
three whos done a lick of work since we got out of the Academy--and
then only because Uncle Sam gently but firmly refused to support me.
But, say, Topham! Howd you get here? In command of a canal boat? Why
dont you speak up instead of making a quiet man break his rule against
talking?

Topham smiled. In fact, he had been smiling ever since he clasped
Risdons hand, quite content to let the other rattle on unchecked. But
at Risdons direct appeal, he began to speak, only to pause as a darkey
servant thrust his head in the door.

Rutile glanced up. Three beers, Caesar, he ordered, and resumed his
writing.

Three beers! protested Risdon, disgustedly. Good Heavens! Rutile!
Three beers! And you claim to be from Kentucky. Then, seeing that the
secretary was not listening, he turned again to Topham.

Whered you say you were going to? he demanded.

I didnt say. But Im on my way to Tokio as naval attach. Leave here
tomorrow night; join the Nevada at Brindisi Friday; go with her to
Manila as watch officer and then by passenger steamer to Japan. Stopped
over here a day to see Rutile.

Caesar re-entered with the beer, but with him he brought a tall dark
bottle and three small glasses. Aint goin to offer beer to no navy
officer or newspaper genmens, he muttered. Aint a-going to do it,
nohow, massa Rutile.

Rutile grinned and laid down his papers. Help yourselves, fellows!
he said. Maybe Caesar knows your tastes better than I do. Prosit! He
lifted his stein and gulped the liquid. Now, Risdon, he went on, You
may confide your troubles to Uncle Sam. Whats troubling the special
commissioner of the New York Gazette to his Imperial Majesty Wilhelm
and the other crowned heads of Europe, Asia, and Africa?

An expression of disgust came over the correspondents face. Dont be
funny, he said, severely. If you think staggering under that tom-fool
appellation is any joke youre mistaken. Say! Rutile! What do you
think of that fellow Ouro Preto, anyhow? Reveal your inmost soul--not
necessarily for publication, but as an evidence of good sense. Speak
the truth. There are no ladies present, so you neednt restrain
yourself.

Rutile stretched out his legs and grinned. I dont like Ouro Preto
much myself, he answered; but plenty of others do. Whats he done to
you?

It isnt what hes done; its what he is! Hes always making up to
me--God knows what for. I dont like him.

Natural antipathy, eh! Ouro Preto is a half German, half Brazilian
count, Topham, whos spending the winter in Berlin and whos trod on
Risdons toes somehow. Probably refused to admit the right of the
American press to pry into his inmost concerns.

Refused, nothing! shouted the reporter. Its my business to read
men, and it ought to be yours, Rutile, if you were with your salt.
Were all as God made us, if not worse. But I give you fair warning to
watch out for Ouro Preto. Hell do you dirt if he gets the chance.
