SCENE:
That, I dont know. All I do know is, theres something rotten in
Holland or Denmark when a man can do what he did with those glasses on.
He knew every card. He trimmed a gull without half trying. Theres a
connection between the smoked-glasses and the cipher. Im sure of that
now. Will you go with me to Stavanger and help look up Harry Raymond? We
can get in a game with him and try to find out how he does it. Hes
clever enough to think of most everything.

You should have mentioned that before, she said, grasping his arm. It
is a clue, Chester. Ill go to Stavanger.

The road led through a patch of marshy ground, over a stile, across a
rising lea-land, and then upon a railroad embankment which stretched
north and south as straight as a ruler.

Fay studied the rails, then led the way toward the switch-points and an
empty goods train which had been shunted from the main line. The
tarpaulins of this train were dripping with moisture. The train crew had
gone up the metals to the low, stone-built station. A green light
gleamed from a signal-arm.

Looks like a way station in Kansas, said Fay as he helped the girl
climb to a high platform. We ought to see a tin-star marshal standing
round chewing on a straw.

A sleepy-eyed operator was in the office. He raised the tiny frosted
window as Fay knocked with his knuckles on the glass. Two of a train
crew stirred from the benches in the waiting-room. They sat erect and
stared across the gloom.

I want to go to Delfzijl, said Fay to the operator and clerk. I think
you pronounce it that way, he added keenly. This lady and I must go!

A guard lumbered across the room and spoke rapidly in Dutch to the
operator. He turned to Fay.

Youll get a train in one hour, he said in fair English. The matter
will be a simple one, sir. How came you in this part of Holland?

I might ask you the same question, said Fay good-naturedly. You have
the first American voice Ive heard in some time.

American, no! Alberta, yes, grinned the goods-train guard. I spent
three years in the Canadian wheat countries.

Fay booked passage by passing through the tiny window enough British
gold to take an entire first-class compartment. He went outside and
pulled a low truck within the shelter of the platform. He waited until
Saidee Isaacs had seated herself. Then he said:

The game starts, Saidee! I hope were on the right scent. I wonder what
peculiar property is in the smoked-glasses Harry Raymond wears? They
certainly help him winat cards.

A double glass or something hidden in the lenses, she suggested.

Something hidden, yes! said Fay. Something hiddengo and find it, he
quoted thoughtfully.

The goods-train crew, who were evidently awaiting the coming of the
north-bound train, stirred finally. They came out yawning, glanced at
the two wanderers on the truck, then crossed the tracks in the direction
of their train which was headed by a squat, open-cab locomotive.

A cone of white fire burst through the fog. A rumble and a whistle
echoed over the moorlands. The train came to a grinding pause as Fay
grasped Saidee Isaacs by the arm and ran down the station platform in
the direction of the single first-class carriage.

They stood on the running-board as the train started.

Fay jerked a door open and helped the girl inside. She sank back on
shiny leather cushions and breathed a long sigh of relief. She was
glancing at herself in a mirror when the guard came along for the
tickets. Fay asked him concerning the boat which met the train. It would
be there, the guard explained with many gestures, but its first port of
call was Christiansand instead of Stavanger.

Fay nodded his head. The guard closed the door. The trip, with Saidee
Isaacs huddled into one corner of the compartment, her eyes closed and
her hat down over her face, was made without accident. Now and then Fay
peered out at the landscape. It was mostly lowland and dykes and the
ever-prevailing windmills which seemed so characteristic of Holland.

Delfzijl was reached just before dawn, and this allowed ample time to
connect with the boat. Fay purchased clean linen and gloves for the girl
and himself. They went up the gangplank of the Romsdala North Sea and
Skagerrack boat with impossible cuisine and soiled cabins.

Hurtled northward, the passage took all the day and the better portion
of the following night. The few passengers were totally uninteresting.
Fay spoke to all of them. He had difficulty in making himself
understood. One, only, a commercial traveler out of England, named
Fairhold, showed interest in the cracksmans questions.
