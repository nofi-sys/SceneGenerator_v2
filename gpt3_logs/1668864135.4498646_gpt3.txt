SCENE:
And when the time comes, my dear madam, that you are in the commanding
place you ought to have--when you are possessed of the power which
money gives--when what is Skeltons now shall be yours and your
childrens--

Hush! cried Mrs. Blair nervously and turning pale. Her eyes sought
for Skelton; he was not five feet off, and one look at him showed
that he had heard every word, and he was too acute and instant of
comprehension not to have taken it in at once. Sylvia Shapleigh had
just gone off with her father, and practically Skelton and Mrs. Blair
and Bulstrode were alone.

You think, perhaps, said Bulstrode, laughing wickedly, that I am
afraid Mr. Skelton will hear-- Bulstrode had not seen Skelton, and
thought him altogether out of earshot. But, to use a very trifling
standard of value, madam, I dont at this moment care a twopenny damn
whether Skelton hears me or not! The money ought to be yours one day,
and it will be-- As he spoke, there was Skelton at his elbow.

Skeltons black eyes were simply blazing. He looked ready to fell
Bulstrode with one blow of his sinewy arm. His first glance--a
fearful one--seemed to sober Bulstrode instantly. The music was still
crashing melodiously in the hall; the warm, perfumed air from the long
greenhouse with its wide-open doors floated in; the yellow light from a
group of wax candles in a sconce fell upon them.

Skelton said not a word as he fixed his eyes wrathfully on Bulstrode,
but Bulstrode seemed actually to wither under that look of concentrated
rage.

Skelton, said Bulstrode in an agony, the drops appearing upon his
broad forehead, I have violated no promise. He stopped, feeling the
weakness of the subterfuge.

I would scarcely exact a promise from one so incapable of keeping
one, answered Skelton in calm and modulated tones. He had but one wish
then, and that was to get Mrs. Blair out of the way that he might work
his will on Bulstrode. The restraint of her presence infuriated him,
the more when she said, in trembling tones:

Pray, forgive him; he was imprudent, but the secret is safe with us.

With us! Then Blair knew as well.

I have no secret, Mrs. Blair, answered Skelton with indomitable
coolness. What this--person told you is no secret. As it is very
remote, and as there are chances of which Bulstrode himself does not
take into account, I thought it useless to inform you. But, if you
desire, I will, to-morrow morning, explain the whole thing to you and
your husband.

Pray--pray, do not! cried Elizabeth.

Skelton bowed, and said: As you please. But rest assured that,
although I never volunteered the information as this man has, yet I
stand ready to answer all questions from those who are authorised to
ask them.

Bulstrode gazed helplessly from one to the other, strangely overcome.
There was something inexpressibly appealing in the look; he feared that
he had lost the regard of the only woman who had for him any tenderness
of feeling, had revealed a stain upon the boy he loved better than any
creature in the world, and had mortally offended the man upon whom he
depended for bread.

Skelton, he cried, almost in tears, I told her when the ruin
that you promised Jack Blair seemed to be accomplished; when she,
indicating Mrs. Blair, was likely to be houseless and homeless; when
her only son lay stretched upon his bed more dead than alive; when, I
tell you, any man who had not a stone in his bosom for a heart would
have felt for her; when I would have laid down my worthless life for
her to have brought ease. Can you blame me?

It was getting to be too much of a scene. Skelton turned towards
Bulstrode, who was utterly abject and pitiable. The collapse of any
human being is overpowering, but of a man with an intellect like
Bulstrodes it became terrible. Mrs. Blairs large and beautiful eyes
filled with tears that rolled down her cheeks and upon her bare, white
neck. She put her hand on Bulstrodes arm; it was the first kind touch
of a womans hand that he had felt for thirty years.

It was your kindness, your tenderness for me and mine that made you
tell me; and if all the world turns against you, I will not.

Bulstrode raised her hand to his lips and kissed it reverently, and her
womanly compassion seemed to awaken some spark of manliness in him. He
made no further appeal.

Skelton all this time was cold with rage. He had been in rages with
Bulstrode many times, and he had wreaked vengeance on him; he could say
words to Bulstrode that would make him wince, but he could not say them
before Mrs. Blair. After a moment he bowed low to her again.
