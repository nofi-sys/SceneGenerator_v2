SCENE:
Oh, very well! said he, gruffly, after a minutes pause. Then I
see what I am to expect; and he got up to walk away with offended
dignity; but, not having recovered his strength yet, and having tired
and excited himself already that afternoon, he staggered before he had
gone many steps, and immediately he found his wifes arm in his. Thank
you, said he, haughtily; then he added, with the air of a martyr, Im
not well yet, not nearly well; Im not strong enough to walk steadily.

Oh, well, Harry, Ive seen you walk just as unsteadily when you were
quite well! said Annie, dryly.

Harry snatched his arm from her, and fell into the nearest chair,
flushing violently.

Very well, maam; you call me a drunkard now! I shouldnt have thought
any woman would have the heart to make fun of a sick husband; but you
dont care for anything as long as you can laugh and scamper about
the garden like a great tomboy with that infernal long-legged idiot
William! You are enough to make any husband drink, just to forget you,
you unfeeling little creature, you!

Come now, Harry, I dont think you can say it was I drove you to
drink; and I think you would have forgotten me pretty quickly even
without that assistance, said she, passing her hand soothingly down
his arm and speaking in a caressing voice, the charm of which always
told on him when she chose to use it. You know very well that it
will not require any more crimes on the part of your wicked wife, for
instance, to induce you to undo all the progress you have made toward
getting well during the last few days by sitting up to-night drinking
with George and Wilfred.

And what do you care if I do?

It is no affair of mine, of course, and I shall not annoy you and
bring down a storm upon my own head by interfering. To borrow your own
words, it would make no difference if I did.

How do you know it wouldnt? Dont I always do what you wish?

I think the temptation to do what I dont wish will be stronger now
you will have pleasanter company than a faded wife.

Whoever called you faded? I never did--you know I never did! And you
know I like your company. I never knew you so pleasant before.

Oh, you dont think me pleasant always!

No; because you say such nasty things--things you never used to dare
to say when I was well. Now Im ill, you think you can say anything,
because Im not strong enough yet to think of anything just as cutting
to say back. But Ill pay you out when I get well again, clever as you
are. He spoke in a rather irritated tone, but not ill-humoredly; she
was so smiling, so careless, that he was as much amused as annoyed by
her.

I shant give you a chance, because I have some very important
business in London, and my duty as your nurse is over, and to-morrow I
shall go to town.

And when are you coming back?--excitedly.

She did not answer.

When do you mean to come back, I say? he repeated, in a louder voice.

Still no answer. Harry clutched his wifes arm.

Then I shall not let you go! You are not my nurse; you are my wife,
and I forbid you to leave me again--do you hear? What is this business
you speak of? What is it? I have a right to know--and I will know!

Annie did not attempt to remove her arm from his grasp, but looked
slowly up at him with a steady, cold, firm expression in her dark eyes,
which silenced him even before she spoke:

You have a right to know, and you shall know. I cant tell you all
now, but just this. For four years, during which you never took the
trouble to find out whether I was starving--and I was not so very far
off that sometimes--I have been working to lay the foundation of a
career for myself--an honorable career, I need not say, even to you.
I have been put back a little, just as I was going to make a great
stride forward, by coming to nurse you. I have fulfilled that duty now,
and, now you are well, I am only wasting my time here. You must let
me go. I will come back when you please, if I can, and I will let you
know everything you wish. But my presence, now you are all going to be
together again, would only irritate you--already it seems to be the
cause of your quarreling with William. You will be disgusted again with
my learned airs, and with my preaching--for I shall not be able to
keep myself from uttering useless remonstrances when I see you going on
in your old way, as I know you will, and bringing back the fever, and
making yourself ill again----
