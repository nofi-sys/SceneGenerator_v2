SCENE:
When he had seen Roy wading ashore, happiness caught him a sudden
blow, and he had staggered for a moment. Then he had rushed forward,
unable to do more than cry: Roy--Roy! in a voice that was a hoarse
whisper. His brother had returned. The world had lurched, hesitated,
and then had gone on spinning merrily. They were together again.

Now the repairs on the canoe were finished. Pop yawned, stretched,
and pulled out his pipe. Then he followed Bug Eye to camp and spent
the next fifteen minutes in disputing Teddys mastery over
bean-eating. At length their appetites were satisfied. The pans were
washed by the simple method of rubbing sand on them and rinsing them
in the river. Blankets were folded. Then, having carried their
possessions to the craft, they were ready to start once more.

Remember those old books in our school library? Teddy asked Roy,
as he stood with his hand on the stern, ready to launch the canoe.
The Amazon Adventurers, or something like that. Where the heroes
always come bobbing up from tornadoes, volcanoes, or what have you,
with a smile on their faces ready to stop a revolution single
handed. Remember the verse Spike Murphy wrote--you know, he played
tackle our second year at Hopper. Like this, I think:

The Amazon Adventurers are always to the mus-tard.
They cut an elephant in half as if he was a cus-tard!

And a lot more, but I forget the rest. Spike used to walk around
the campus singing it. Well, the point of this is that thats the
way I feel now. Its a good thing there arent any elephants around.
But something tells me Ill have my work-out yet. There is still
much to be done, as the cook said, turning the whale steak he was
roasting. Ill bet--

Youll bet nothing! Roy interrupted, with a laugh. What is this,
a political speech? Youve been talking an hour by the clock. Grab
hold, and shove. Ready, Pop and Bug Eye? Then lets go!

All four bent down and seized the gunwales. There was a straining of
backs, and the canoe slid noiselessly into the river with scarcely a
splash.

No leakee! Teddy shouted, capering around the bank. No leakee, no
shirtee! Watch it, boys. Ill bet two bits she dont leak!

Doesnt, Bug Eye corrected, a certain page of his English book
before his mind. A plural predicate takes the nominative singular.
Or something. Anyway, dont aint nowheres near right.

Did you say singular? Teddy asked, grinning. It is that, at
least! But tell me, boys--Im afraid to look. Does she leak?

Nary leak! Pop exclaimed, leaning close. Guess I qualify for an
expert boat-maker, dont I? All right, Teddy, stop yore solo an hop
in.

_Aprs vous, msieu_, Teddy smirked, and bowed low. I assure you
I crave to see you get wet first.

Dont mind him, Pop, Roy laughed. Thats French, and not what you
think it means. He just said: after you! so dont get sore. Come
on, Teddy, you tomato! Get in there before I toss you in!

_Now_ you said something! the boy ejaculated. I obey with
pleasure--but Ill be back--oh, Ill be ba-a-a-a-ak! and he waved a
hand vigorously as he settled himself in the bottom of the canoe.

Youll be back before youre gone, Roy remarked. You paddle, my
young gentleman of leisure. Oh, yes, theres more than one. Bug Eye
found the one that wasnt broken, and this stick will do for the bow
paddle. Here. On your horse, cowboy!

Teddy took the flat board Roy held out to him and looked at it
wonderingly.

I am to paddle with _this_? he said in a shocked voice. Roy, my
social position! I could never forgive myself--paddling Whirlpool
River with a flat board! Dear, dear, what will Mrs. Percy Van Pelt
say when she hears about this? I shall never, _never_ hear the last
of it!

Well try to keep it out of the papers, Roy replied, laughing
loudly. Pipe down now, and go to work. Just forget Mrs. Percy Van
Pelt and remember me sitting back of you here with a strong paddle
and a good reach.

I desire an objection noted, Teddy murmured, as he took the stick
and shifted to the bow seat. I obey, but under protest. All right,
capin, whenever you say! Im all set.

Everything in? Roy asked, looking about him. Rifles in the
bottom? Yep. Were off, boys. The Amazon Adventurers!
