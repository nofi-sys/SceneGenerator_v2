SCENE:
VIII

Follow Us


With a bound, the boys were out of the corral and running toward the
house. As they came closer they saw a look of anxiety on their
mothers face.

What is it? Roy shouted, not slacking his pace. Is any one hurt?

No, not that! But I just went to your fathers desk to get a
blotter from the drawer, and a large sum of money is missing! It was
taken from his desk last night!

The explanation of Mrs. Manleys concern came as a relief, rather
than a shock, to Teddy and Roy. On that short journey from the
corral to the house, their minds had run the gamut of emotions--they
did not know what to expect. Since the true character of The Pup was
known to them, they had almost feared he had attempted to injure
some one within the house.

How much was it, Mother? Roy asked, as he reached the porch.

About four hundred dollars. Your father drew it from the bank the
day before yesterday to pay the men with. He must have forgotten to
tell you about it, though he may have wanted to wait until he
returned before giving the boys their wages. Now its gone! The
drawer was forced and the money stolen. Do you think any of the
men--I dont like to mention it, but--

Dont worry, Mom, none of the boys did it, Teddy assured her.

We know whos got it; but that wont help much, Roy said.

You do? Mrs. Manleys eyes expressed her surprise. How do you
know?

Because the money isnt the only thing thats missing. That pony
dad liked so well is gone, too.

The one Belles been riding--the one you broke? A frown came to
Mrs. Manleys face. Your father will be sorry to hear that. Next to
his own horse, he liked that pony better than any on the place. But
tell me--who took him? And who took the money?

The Pup, Roy declared, pressing his lips together.

Joe Marino! The man Gus rode with! Mrs. Manley shook her head
sadly. Im very sorry. I was afraid he would cause trouble of some
sort after your father discharged him. But are you sure?

I am! Teddy exclaimed decidedly. He came back last night, Mother.
I met him. Wisely, the boy did not tell of his fight with the man.
I told him to stay away from here, and, as I remember now, he was
near the corral when I caught him! He must have sneaked into dads
office, taken the money, and then he got the pony out. So-o-o
_thats_ what he meant when he said his job here was finished!
Teddy brought a fist down sharply into his open palm. And I had him
in my hands! If I only had that chance over again, Id certainly
make the most of it! Wonder how far away he is by now? Maybe we
could--

Cool off, Roy advised. No use to beef about a thing thats
already happened. The thing to do is to find Joe Marino.

Are you certain it was he? Mrs. Manley asked.

We sure are! came from Teddy. How about it, Roy? Wouldnt you bet
your bottom dollar that The Pup did this?

Both his mother and Teddy waited for the reply. They had confidence
that Roy would not go off half cocked, a trait which Teddy had in
full measure. Besides this, with Mr. Manley gone, the mother and
younger brother leaned toward Roy as the natural head of the family.

Marino, Roy said slowly, is the thief, or Im a ring-tailed
doodle bird.

And theres no two ways about it! Teddy added. Come on,
Roy--well go get him! Hes got a payroll and a horse of ours!

But, boys-- Mrs. Manley began, when Roy threw an arm
affectionately over her shoulder.

Dont worry, Mom, he interjected. Dad told us to stick, and stick
we do until he sends for us, payroll or no payroll. Teddy, you fly
off the handle too fast. You know what the orders were.

Thats right, too, the younger lad said, a bit regretfully. But
it sure does seem a shame to let a skunk get away so easily!
