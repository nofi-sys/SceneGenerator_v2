SCENE:
VIII.


Sylvia went back into the house, troubled in mind, and all that day
the thought followed her that she had probably brought about Skeltons
defeat by what she had done. There was no question of a match between
Jaybird and Alabaster that autumn; but in the spring--however, much
might happen in the meantime, for so Sylvia consoled herself, and
heartily wished that Alabaster had never been seen or heard of.

There had not been much intercourse between Belfield and Deerchase in
the weeks that Skelton had been at home. He had promptly called after
the dinner, and it was understood that he intended giving a large ball
some time or other, but beyond a few of the gentlemen of the county
nobody had been entertained by Skelton at all.

Sylvia could not keep her eyes from wandering towards Deerchase, for
Skelton was a man who always aroused interest, and then her tender
womans heart was very soft towards Lewis Pryor.

It was generally agreed that there was a mystery about the boy, and,
for no better reason than this, his existence was ignored by the
county gentry, who paid formal visits to Deerchase, but who did not
take their sons with them if they happened to have boys of Lewiss
age. Sylvia saw him every day--sailing his boat on the river, fishing
sometimes, or lying down under the trees with his dog--always alone.
Once or twice she met him in the road and stopped and talked with
him. The boy was won by her grace and charming manners, and admired
her shyly while answering her questions, with his black eyes fixed on
the ground. After meeting her two or three times he grew bolder, and
actually one day left at Belfield a bouquet of golden rod, with his
compliments scrawled in a large, boyish hand on a card. Mrs. Shapleigh,
passing through the hall as Lewis, blushing very much, handed the
bouquet in, seized upon it and carried it off in triumph to Sylvia.

Just look, my dear! No doubt it came from Richard Skelton, poor
fellow! He is just eating his heart out because he cant ask you to
marry him, but still he likes to pay you these delicate attentions.
Wild flowers, too--so much sentiment!

Mamma, said Sylvia sharply, please be reasonable. Look at this: they
are from Lewis Pryor, that black-eyed boy that is Mr. Bulstrodes ward.

And not from Richard Skelton! Dear, dear! Do throw the things out,
Sylvia; they are not worth houseroom. And, my dear, there is some
mystery about that boy, and youd better not have anything to do with
him.

Poor little Lewis! The only mystery that I see about him is that he is
young and lonely and wants friends. I never saw a more winning boy in
my life.

Something in the gift touched Sylvia. She realised, with a smile, that
Lewis had probably endured agonies of bashfulness before and after
sending his bouquet. She wrote him a pretty little note, and sealed
it with a motto such as was the fashion in those days. Bob Skinny
presented the note that night at the dinner table to Lewis with a great
flourish.

Miss Sylvia Shapleigh, sah, sont you dis heah billy-doo. Bob Skinny
had not been to Paris for nothing, and interlarded his conversation
with such scraps of French as he could muster.

Lewis, turning very red under Skeltons eye, opened the note and read
it, afterwards putting it into his pocket with studied carelessness.
Glancing up, he saw Skeltons gaze, usually so serious, fixed, half
laughingly, upon him.

You have the advantage of me, Lewis, said Skelton, smiling; I have
never been honoured with a note from Miss Shapleigh.

Perhaps, sir, answered Lewis, after a pause, you never sent Miss
Shapleigh any flowers.

Skelton was secretly delighted with the aptness of the boys reply, and
remarked pleasantly:

That is true. You seem, however, to have got the start of me in that
respect too.

Lewis, for the first time in his life before Skeltons face, burst
out laughing. Skelton started with surprise. He scarcely knew the
boy possessed a laugh so fresh, so merry, so boyish. Then, blushing
violently, Lewis relapsed into silence, but those few words and the
laugh had in some way shown him that the barrier between Skelton and
himself was not so icy after all.

Bulstrode teased the boy unceasingly about his bouquet, but Lewis was
not to be turned from his liking by teasing. Soon after the bouquet
episode he wrote a note in his best hand and carefully copied from the
Complete Letter-writer, inviting Sylvia to take a sail in his boat.
Sylvia accepted, and the next morning she was promptly on hand as the
boat touched the wharf at Belfield.
