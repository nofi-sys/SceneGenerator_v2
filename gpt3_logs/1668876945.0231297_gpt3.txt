SCENE:
Is it? I never played cricket.

Oh, no end! Crickets a bully good game, too, but its a lot more
quiet andersedate, if you know what I mean. Well, Ill toddle. Hope
you get on finely, Baker. And drop in some time, eh?

Thanks, answered Dud. Then, as Hugh moved away, he blurted: Did you
really mean that, Ordway?

What? Why, of course!

Thenthen I will. I didnt know Duds voice trailed off into
silence as he dropped an embarrassed gaze. Hugh smiled and nodded.

Right-o, Baker! Glad to have you.

Dud, wishing he hadnt made such a fool of himself, bent stern
attention on his glove until the red had subsided from his cheeks. He
will think me an awful kid, he reflected. Asking things like that
andand blushing like a silly girl! And of course he couldnt say
anything else. You wont catch me going!

Further self-communing was cut short by Mr. Sargent. All right,
Baker, called the coach. Warm up, will you? Brooks will catch you.
See if you cant steady down today.

Dud squirmed out of his sweater, pulled his glove on and joined Ed
Brooks in front of the first-base stand. Brunswick had taken Kellys
place in the box and it would be Duds turn next. As Brooks tossed
the ball to him and spread his hands invitingly wide apart Dud hoped
hard that he would be able to steady down, but doubted it. As yet
the recollection of that impulsive question to Ordway still made his
face burn. Consequently when, after pitching a half-dozen easy ones
to warm his arm, he began to put on a little speed, he was pleased as
well as surprised to find that some of his old control had come back.
Encouraged, he made greater efforts to put the ball where he wanted to
and, unconsciously, began to steam up. But Brooks cautioned him and
Dud slowed down.

Thats pitching em, called Brooks. Theyre all straight, though,
Dud, or pretty near it. Try a slant.

But Dud resisted the temptation to hook one and shook his head.
Instead, he sent over a slow one that fooled Brooks completely and
brought from the latter a laugh at his own expense. Do it again, he
urged, as he threw the ball back. I want to get used to those.

Ill wait until youre not expecting it, laughed Dud.

There was no line-up today, but first and second-string players were
batting and running the bases, taking their places in the field
ultimately to let others come in. Weston, Kelly and Brunswick had
held the mound for an inning or two apiece, while Ben Myatt and Nate
Leddy were trying to improve their hitting, a thing that the latter
was rather weak at. Presently the outfielders were called in in a body
and others took their places, and changes were made in the infield.
Brunswick went to the shower and Dud to the pitchers box. Pete Gordon
was still catching.

All right, Baker! called Pete. Strike em out, boy. Put her over
now.

Neil Ayer fouled one and then landed on the next and went to first,
and Bert Winslow took his place. The pitchers were not expected to
work hard, for a batsman stayed in until he hit or was caught out.
Bert was difficult to dispose of, since he cannily refused everything
that wasnt distinctly a strike, and Dud pitched a dozen deliveries
before Bert found one he liked and rapped it to deep center. Meanwhile
Mr. Sargent was coaching Ayer from first to second and on to third,
making him slide to every base even though he was not threatened. When,
however, he tried to steal home on Duds wind-up, Dud managed to keep
his head, send in a fast one and saw Ayer nailed a yard from the rubber.

It wasnt especially interesting work and some of the hits were
screechers into deep right, left or center that the outfielders
couldnt begin to get their hands onto. Dud had not had much experience
in fielding his position and was momentarily in fear that a hot liner
would come at his head. If one did, he was quite certain he would duck
and quite disgrace himself. But when, after some nine or ten batters
had faced him, Captain Murtha hit one squarely on the nose and it came
straight at Dud, the latter involuntarily put up his hands and, while
he didnt make the catch, knocked it down, recovered it and tossed out
Murtha at first. He got a round of applause from the stand for that,
which so rattled him that his next delivery shot past Gordon a good
four feet to his right and let in a runner from third. The batter sent
the next one off on a voyage to deep center and took two bases. The
base-runners were taking such extraordinary chances and Mr. Sargent
was making such a hullabaloo back of first that Dud began to lose his
control badly, and he was forced to put exactly eleven balls across
before Weston, tired of waiting for a good one, reached for a wide ball
and fouled out to first-baseman.
