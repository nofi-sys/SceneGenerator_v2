SCENE:
XIV.

Twenty-Three to One.


The absence of wind kept the schooner at anchor off Brewster for two
days. During this time Hoppy Mayo avoided a clash with Dunton, though
the latters surliness was increased by his enforced inactivity. The
frigate was expected back any moment now and Dunton knew Captain
Raggett would be displeased with the meagre results of the schooners
cruise if she were obliged to remain in idleness off Brewster. However,
there was no help for it, and unless a favorable breeze came up the
best the surveying party could do would be to send a small boat as
far eastward as Orleans creek, a distance of about two miles. Further
than this Dunton decided not to risk his men. His naturally suspicious
temperament caused him to imagine all sorts of traps laid for him
by the accursed Yankees who, he well knew, were watching his every
movement from the shore.

On the evening of the second day, the aspect of the sky betokened a
change of weather. The atmosphere was very still and the sun went down
in a blaze of blood-red radiance. Hoppy was tranquilly smoking his pipe
after supper when Dunton approached and said:

Looks like a change, Mayo? I dont remember having seen such a sunset
since I came to this coast.

The American had seen many such sunsets and he knew their meaning.
After a keen look at the steel-blue cloud that was showing up over the
spot where the sun had disappeared, he answered the officer.

Yes, Mr. Dunton, it certainly looks as if we were in for one of our
summer tempests. I dont like the look of that cloud.

There is not a breath of air at present, Mayo.

No, sir; that is one of the signs of a tempest in this locality. It
may not come up until midnight, but we are going to have it before
tomorrow morning.

This is not very safe holding ground in case of a blow, said Dunton
somewhat anxiously.

Thats so, Mr. Dunton.

Well, Im going below, Mayo, and I want you to remain on deck and
watch for a puff that may enable us to get into a better anchorage.

Very good, sir; I shall call you when it comes.

After Dunton went below Hoppy felt inclined to dance a jig on the deck.
Perhaps, after all, his expectations would be fulfilled? Was not this
tempest the one thing wanting to hasten the success of the scheme which
his wily brain had fashioned during the days of his captivity on the
schooner? Twenty-three to one were the odds against him up to this, but
with a roaring blow from the northwest as an ally he felt as if he had
more than a fighting chance. One blast from the trumpet of the Lord
would open the floodgates of the heavens and the pilots unerring eye
had read the message of promise written in the evening sky!

Two junior officers, three seamen and Hoppy made up the watch on deck.
One of the seamen, a chap named Jackson, was especially friendly with
the pilot and had a great contempt for Dunton. Jackson was a typical
old salt; a fine seaman who had spent the greater part of his life in
the navy, but he had reached the limit of promotion when he got his
rating as able seaman. His fondness for grog had kept him back, though
he would not admit the impeachment, preferring to put the blame on his
want of influence with such officers as Dunton who, he confided to
Hoppy, had a man at their mercy if they took a dislike to him. It was
now quite dark and Hoppy, unseen by the officers, managed to have a few
words with Jackson.

I guess youre getting about sick of the calm, Jackson? Looks like a
change, though.

Yes, mate, replied Jackson, I am. Im sick of the whole d----d
business. There aint no glory an there aint no prize-money in this
here war. Settin British sailors to such work as ketchin rowboats an
fishin schooners an then makin headquarters in a town that aint got
a decent grogshop aint wot we was used to in the navy.

Tis certainly poor work for brave men, Jackson.

That it is, assented Jackson vehemently.

Well, Jackson, as the commanding officer has ordered me to remain on
deck to watch with you, I dont see why we shouldnt be as comfortable
as we can make ourselves. What do you say to this? Hoppy produced a
flask of rum.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

Hoppy Mayo and Jackson, a seamen, are on watch on the deck of a schooner. They discuss the sunset and the coming storm. Hoppy tells Jackson that the storm is an opportunity for them to escape. Jackson agrees and they drink rum together.
