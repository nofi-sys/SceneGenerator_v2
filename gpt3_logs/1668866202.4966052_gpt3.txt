SCENE:
XXII

SILVAS MESSAGE


After the dishes are washed and wiped, lets set the table for
supper, Laura suggested. Floribel will be so tired when she gets
home, and thinks of all the work shell have to do alone.

So the girls added this to the work they had already done.

Shall we go in bathing this afternoon? Rosie asked when the last
knife and fork was in place.

You all go if you want, Maida answered, I dont think I want to
swim. Somehow I feel as though Id like to stay about the house. So
many things have happened that Im worried about going away.

So do I, Maida, Laura agreed emphatically.

So although the boys went in swimming as usual, the girls stayed at
home.

I feel tired, too, Maida remarked. They took books from the library
and settled quietly in the Tree Room where they read and talked all
the afternoon. They were interrupted twice--once by the boys who, as
though they had a responsibility too, cut their swimming short--and by
the baby.

When the baby awoke, late in the afternoon, Rosie brought her
downstairs into the air for a while. They all declared that she looked
quite a different child. A tinge of pink had come into her soft brown
cheeks and the warmth and moisture of her nap had curled the brown hair
in her neck.

Oh you sweet _sweet_ darling! Maida kissed the little girl
ecstatically. Oh how I wish your parents would give you to me! Thats
all we need in the Little House--a baby. Delias not quite little
enough. She caught Delia and kissed her.

Delia bid dirl, Delia protested.

Even the boys were amused and entertained by their little visitor.
Arthur deigned to make faces for her. They amused her enormously,
and when Harold unloosed an ear-splitting whistle, she turned round,
delighted eyes in his direction. But that she was still tired was
evident; she kept falling into little naps.

I dont think Ill bathe her again so soon, Rosie meditated with
knitted brows when they had taken her upstairs for the night.
To-morrow Ill give her a bath in the morning and another at night.
But now Ill just wash her face and hands and let her have her bottle.
You do it this time, Maida and to-morrow, added Rosie, generous
always, well take turns bathing and feeding her.

As they came downstairs Laura said, I wonder what time it is. Oh half
past five!

Five! Maida exclaimed. Why Floribel ought to have been home at five!
What train can she get now?

Nobody knew, but Arthur remembered there was a time-table in the
library. They clustered about him. To most of them it was as difficult
as Greek; but to Arthur, who had had some experience in traveling and
to Maida who had had a great deal, it did not seem insolvable.

They puzzled over it together.

Theres a train at six from Boston and another at seven, they finally
decided. And thats all.

She must have lost the three from Boston, Maida declared. But the
six from Boston isnt due here until eight. And in the meantime well
have to get supper.

Say let us boys help, Arthur suggested. It must be a big job
cooking for twelve. I know how to cook, he added unexpectedly.

Where did you learn, Arthur? Maida asked with interest.

Tramping with my father, Arthur answered briefly. We often camped in
the woods for days.

Supper isnt so hard as dinner, Rosie said hopefully. Now I propose
that we have a combination salad with hard-boiled eggs cut up in it.
You see theres a lot of cold vegetables in the ice chest and we can
make a custard and orange pudding.

The whole group, three girls and three boys, bustled into the kitchen.
From a drawer full of aprons, Rosie took out enough for all of them.
The little girls wore the aprons as they should be worn, but in the
boys case, Rosie tied them around their necks. Ive seen boys cook
before, she announced scornfully, and when they get through, they
generally look as though they had fallen into a barrel of something.
