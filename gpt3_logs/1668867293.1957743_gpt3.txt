SCENE:
I had been hiding in the home of a friend of my father, but I knew that
if I were found there, it would bring death to him and his family, and
so I came away, hoping to find a place where I might be safe from them;
but I guess there is no place for meeven my friends, the Nipons,
though they would let me stay with them, admit that it would be a
hardship to provide for me.

What will you do? I asked. Somehow I felt very sorry for her.

I shall find some nearly inaccessible place in the hills and build
myself a shelter, she replied.

But you cannot live here in the hills alone, I remonstrated.

She shrugged her shoulders. Where may I live, then?

For a little while, perhaps, I suggested, until the Kalkars are
driven into the sea.

Who will drive them into the sea? she asked.

We, I replied, proudly.

And if you do, how much better off shall I be? Your people will set
their hounds upon meyou have said so yourself. But you will not drive
the Kalkars into the sea. You have no conception of their numbers. All
up and down the coast, days journeys north and south, wherever there is
a fertile valley, they have bred like flies. For days they have been
coming from all directions, marching toward The Capital. I do not know
why they congregate now, nor why only the warriors come. Are they
threatened, do you think? A sudden thought seemed to burst upon her.
It cannot be, she exclaimed, that the Yanks have attacked them! Have
your people come out of the desert again?

Yes, I replied. Yesterday we attacked their great camptoday my
warriors must have eaten their evening meal in the stone tents of the
Kalkars.

You mean The Capital?

Yes.

Your forces have reached The Capital? It seems incredible. Never before
have you come so far. You have a great army?

Twenty-five thousand warriors marched down out of the desert beneath
The Flag, I told her, and we drove the Kalkars from the pass of the
ancients back to The Capital, as you call their great camp.

You lost many warriors? You must have.

Many fell, I replied; thousands.

Then you are not twenty-five thousand now, and the Kalkars are like
ants. Kill them and more will come. They will wear you down until your
few survivors will be lucky if they can escape back to their desert.

You do not know us, I told her. We have brought our women, our
children, our flocks and herds down into the orange groves of the
Kalkars and there we shall remain. If we cannot drive the Kalkars into
the sea today we shall have to wait until tomorrow. It has taken us
three hundred years to drive them this far, but in all that time we have
never given back a step that we have once gainedwe have never
retreated from any position to which we have brought our families and
our stock.

You have a large family? she asked.

I have no wife, I replied as I rose to add fuel to the fire. As I
returned with a handful of sticks I saw that she hugged closer to the
blaze and that she shivered with the cold. I removed my Kalkar robe and
threw it across her shoulders.

No! she cried, rising; I cannot take it. You will be cold. She held
it out toward me.

Keep it, I said. The night will be cold, and you cannot go until
morning without covering.

She shook her head. No! she repeated. I cannot accept favors from an
enemy who hates me. She stood there, holding the red robe out toward
me. Her chin was high and her expression haughty.

I stepped forward and took the robe, and as her hand dropped to her side
I threw the woolen garment about her once more and held it there upon
her slim figure. She tried to pull away from it, but my arm was about
her, holding the robe in place, and as I guessed her intention, I
pressed the garment more closely around her, which drew her to me until
we stood face to face, her body pressed against mine. As I looked down
into her upturned face our eyes met and for a moment we stood there as
though turned to stone. I do not know what happened. Her eyes, wide and
half frightened, looked up into mine, her lips were parted and she
caught her breath once in what was almost a sob. Just for an instant we
stood thus and then her eyes dropped and she bent her head and turned it
half away and at the same time her muscles relaxed and she went almost
limp in my arms. Very gently I lowered her to her seat beside the fire
and adjusted the robe about her. Something had happened to me. I did not
know what it was, but of a sudden nothing seemed to matter so much in
all the world as the comfort and safety of Bethelda.
