SCENE:
Why are you going? he wanted to know.

A little matter, a mere trifle. You seem to have forgotten it, butwe
havent been introduced.

Now looky here, maam. Whats in a name? Some guys says, Meet Mr.
Jones, an you claim you know me. Not a thing to that. Its a heap more
fun to do our own introducin. Now aint it? Honest Injun! Im anything
you want to call me, an youre Miss-Lady-in-the-Apple-Blossoms. An now
thats been fixed, I reckon Ill take the elevator up.

The girls eyes sparkled. There was something attractive about this
young fellows impudence that robbed it of offence. Womanlike, her mind
ran to evasions. You cant come up. Youd shake down all the blossoms.

If I shook em all down but one Ill bet the tree would bloom to beat
any other in the orchard.

If that is meant for a compliment

No, Lady, for the truth.

He caught the lowest limb and was about to swing himself up. Her sharp
No! held him an instant while their eyes met. A smile crept into his
and gave the face a roguish look, a touch of Pan.

Will you come down then?

At my convenience, sir.

An upward swing brought him to the fork of the tree. Yet a moment, and
he was beside her among the blossoms. Her eyes swept him in one swift
glance, curiously, a little shyly.

With not even a by-your-leave. You are a claim jumper, she said.

No, maam. Im locatin the one adjoinin yores.

You may have mine, since Im vacating it.

Now dont you, he protested. Let yoreself go once an be natural.
Like a human being. Hear that meadow-lark calling to his mate. Hes
tellin his lady friend how strong he is for her. Why even the
irrigation ditch is singin a right nice song about what a peach of a
day it is.

The girls eyes appraised him without seeming to do so. So far the
cow-punchers she had met had been shy and awkward, red-faced and
perspiring. But this youth was none of these. The sun and the wind of
the Rockies had painted the tan on face and neck and hands, had
chiselled tiny humorous wrinkles that radiated from the corners of his
eyes. Every inch of the broad-rimmed felt hat, of the fancy silk
kerchief, of the decorated chaps, certified him a rider of the range.
But where had he picked up that spirited look of gay energy, that
whimsical smile which combined deference and audacity?

He travels fast, the girl announced to the world at large. Which
reminds me that so must I.

Larry too made a confidant of his environment. I wonder how shell get
past meunless she really has wings.

Ive heard that all Westerners are gentlemen at heart, she mused
aloud. Of course hell let me past.

Now shes tryin to flatter me. Nothin doing. Well give it out right
now that Im no gentleman, he replied, impersonally. Then, abandoning
his communion with the apple blossoms, he put a question to the young
woman who shared the tenancy of the tree with him: Mind if I smoke?

Why should you ask me, since you confessor do you boast?that you
are no gentleman?

From the pocket of his shirt he drew tobacco and paper, then rolled a
cigarette. Im one off an on, he explained. Whenever it dont cramp
my style, you understand.

She took advantage of his preoccupation with the makings, stepped
lightly to a neighbouring branch, swung to a lower one, and dropped
easily to earth.

The eyes that looked up at him sparkled triumph. I wish you luck in
your search for that paragon youre to meet before sunset, she said.

Ill be lucky. Dont you worry about that, he boasted coolly. Only I
dont have to find her now. Ive found her.

Then, unexpectedly, they went down into the alfalfa together amid a
shower of apple blossoms. For he, swinging from the branch upon which he
sat, had dropped, turned his ankle on an outcropping root, and clutched
at her as he fell.
