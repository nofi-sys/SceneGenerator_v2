SCENE:
We punish treachery by death!

Such is a partial schedule of the terms of one of these terrible
confederacies, as furnished in a detached note by Yieger, which held
its secret sessions in New York city. He seems to have obtained a
sight of some of their records, but by what means, the most daring
could only conjecture. He appears to have regarded this particular
organisation as the most formidable of all, and to have traced many of
its ramifications, in their covert results, with a singularly dogged
tenacity.

Among the extraordinary papers contained in the Cabinet he has left,
are to be found short notes, containing what are clearly reports and
proceedings of this formidable conclave. Its mysterious signature,
Regulus, seems to have been known throughout the world; and even he,
though clearly a fierce and relentless foe, never writes it, but with
the involuntary concession of respect, which large, clear letters,
underscored, would seem to convey.

Having now presented such an outline of the character and designs of
this secret conclave, as the means of information furnished him have
enabled him to do, the Editor will proceed with the promised extracts
from its proceedings, such as relate to those in regard to whom the
reader may be supposed to have some curiosity.

First, we have here


A NOTE CONCERNING ETHERIAL SOFTDOWN.

This woman, whose patronymic was Softdown, first married a Quaker,
named Orne; which name, after her separation, and until after her
divorce, she continued to bear, with the _alias_ of Marie. She
began her public career, soon after her marriage, as a Quaker
preacher; but the straitness of this sect not conforming at all to
her latitudinarian principles, she recanted in disgust, and left
the society. She now plunged at once into Physiology, and, after a
miraculously short gestation, produced a few lectures, with which she
went the rounds of two or three New England States, accompanied by her
husband, whom she, _sans ceremonie_, dubbed M. D., without putting him
to the trouble of reading, or ever having read, a book on any subject.
He officiated as her doorkeeper, and received the shillings; but,
refusing to render any account of the proceeds, a furious feud grew up
between them, and soon the war waxed hot and fierce.

Finding this to be poor business on the whole, she deserted him,
taking her child with her. The next occupation in which we find her
versatile genius engaged, was that of teaching French; a more humble
employment, surely, but one for which she was equally well fitted.
This, however, soon disgusted her, as her unreasonable patrons would
insist upon the vulgar necessity of her being able to speak French,
as well as teach it. It was at best but a tame avocation, and one
entirely unsuited to her ambitious temper.

Having now fairly assayed her wings for flight, she soared aloft at
once, in full career, through mid-air. She became first a preacher
of Universalism; but meeting, about this time, with the celebrated
Boanerges Phospher, she, in a few weeks, turned out full-plumed,
as a lecturer on Elocution. To this she soon added a knowledge of
Phrenology, which, in her active zeal, she took care to impart to the
world, as fast as acquired, and in the same public manner.

Then, as a natural consequence, came Mesmerism; then Neurology. Of
all these sciences she became the prompt expounder, after a few days
investigation.

From this point she immediately ascended a step higher, and announced
herself as a revelator in Clairvoyance; and, by an inevitable
progression, she at once found admission, along with Andrew Jackson
Davis and a host of other seers, into the Swedenborgian Arcana, and
held herself on terms of frequent intercourse and positive intimacy
with the angel Gabriel, and, indeed, the whole heavenly host.

They revealed to her that the great and unpardonable sins of humanity
were, first, eating pork; second, using tobacco, whether snuffing,
smoking, or chewing; and, third, wine-drinking in all its forms. They
accordingly commissioned her, formally, to go forth into the world
as a missionary, to warn mankind against the fearful consequences of
these vices, and to save them therefrom.

The exposition of Grahamism and Bran-bread was now added to the
enlarged circle of her enlightened Professorships; and, by this
aid, and that of her spiritual commission, she wrought wonders, in
assailing the camps of the great foes of humanityPork, Tobacco, and
Wine!

Many were the brands plucked by her from the burning, or rather
savedpreachers, lawyers, editors, artists, and watery-eyed young
gentlemen, in particular. It was on this grand tour that she
first assumed her most distinguished attribute, the Patroness of
Artparticularly of the Artists.


DESCRIPTION OF LITERARY STYLE:

==========

The style of this scene is highly satirical. The author is clearly poking fun at the character of Etherial Softdown, and her many "accomplishments." The tone is one of mockery, and the point of view is that of an outside observer.
