SCENE:
Markham! O Markham!

Agnes! he faltered, as he heard the tones of her voice, so pathetic in
its intensity.

She stood before him, her hands clasped, her pale face agonized with
fear and supplication.

It was a scene for a painter. The gladiatorial attitude of the Major,
the frightened faces of Lissa, Elinor, and Alice, with Nathan and Mark
standing at either side as rescuers.

Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord, feebly quoted
Agnes.

The Majors hands fell. He took his foot from Teasdales body as the man
began to breathe and struggle to rise.

Mark bent forward to assist him, then started back in disgust.

Its that contemptible hound Russell, he said, with a gesture of
abhorrence. Lie where you are, sir, you travesty upon man, until we see
about this! Lie still, or, by the powers, Ill finish you myself!

Get him out of my sight, or Ill not answer for the results! the Major
cried in a hoarse voice. There is all of murder in my heart, and my
conscience would not trouble me more than if I had killed a snake.

The lock-ups the place for him. Hes unfit to run loose, said Mark.

Im sorry to be found in such company, Captain Cramer, but Nathan will
explain to you my cause of provocation, Walden continued. And this
letter will explain to you, turning to Mrs. Lucien.

He took a letter from his pocket with a dead letter stamp upon it, and
handed it to her. This has but recently been returned to me from
Washington.

Wait! He shall explain, cried Nathan, catching the battered and
bleeding Teasdale, or Russell, by the collar and jerking him forward.

Here, you knave, explain to these ladies that those letters you wrote
and sent were but forgeries, fabricated and secreted by you or your
emissaries, to work ruin and unhappiness.

Russell gulped and gasped in an effort to speak.

Speak! Out with it! Tell the truth! Mark commanded savagely.

I admit it, he groaned at last. I wrote the letters and bribed a
servant to hide them in a desk at the Majors house when his wife was
away from home, in the hope that he might find them and believe that she
was false to him. She knew nothing of them, nor did she ever receive a
letter from me.

Oh, wretched man! How could you conceive of such infamy! murmured
Agnes, turning away her pallid face.

It is to be hoped you will receive a just reward for your wickedness,
said Mrs. Wylie, who in the light of this scene could unravel all the
mysteries that had so long puzzled her with regard to Mrs. Luciens past
history.

He shall receive it if there is any justice in this land of ours, said
Mark. This is not the only crime he has to answer for. What could have
been your object in this case, you dog?

Revenge! Russell uttered the word with an evil sneer.

Can you ever forgive me, Agnes? Major Walden had turned from Russell
and was looking at Agnes beseechingly.

As I hope to be forgiven, Markham, she replied solemnly.

Thank you. It is more than I have a right to expect. I His voice
broke in its utterance, and he turned away to recover his self-control.

And now what shall we do with this fellow? asked Nathan. Turn him
over to the police?

He certainly should not be allowed to go about leaving in his wake the
slimy trail of the serpent, responded Mark. Ill swear out a warrant
charging him with abducting Esther McCleary.

There are reasons, said Major Walden, why it might be unpleasant to
bring my affair into court. However, I am ready to testify against him
if needed.

Mark turned again toward Russell, but to his consternation and
astonishment the man had vanished. Before the eyes of six persons he had
managed to glide away unobserved. They looked up and down the streets,
peered into stairways, and searched alleys, but he was not to be found.
He had disappeared as suddenly and entirely as though the ground had
opened and swallowed him.
