SCENE:
She had already forgotten the long period during which she had looked
upon her husband as a tiresome, unreasonable child.

Yes, when I was getting well at the Grange you didnt always treat me
with proper respect, I fancy, said he, flushing, but looking down into
her eyes rather mischievously.

Oh, ah--then you were ill! she said, blushing too.

The last words she said to her husband as the train went off were:

Remember you are not to be with me later than four. Promise.

All right; I promise.

And, trying to look as if her mind was at ease, Annie gave him a last
smiling Good-bye, as the train started.

On arriving in town, she drove straight to the house where Stephen
lodged, and, finding that he was out, she sat down in the sitting-room
to wait for him. Long ere this an explanation of the cripples cruel
and deceitful conduct had occurred to her, and it seemed more and more
probable to her, as she sat in the shabby sitting-room, with its low,
weather-stained ceiling and ill-papered walls. Evidently the money
which he had kept back from her he had not spent upon himself; it must
have gone where her jewelry had gone, and Harrys flowers--to Muriel
West. Annie knew well to what depths of meanness he would descend
in his devotion to a woman, for she remembered with what dogged and
disinterested fidelity he had fulfilled every command, every wish of
his cousin Lilian in the old days at the Grange, before her marriage
with Mr. Falconer. In spite of her contempt for a man who could stoop
to such acts, Annie was touched by the cripples hapless attachment,
and a great pity filled her heart as she heard the slow thud, thud of
his crutch upon the staircase. Her compassion deepened when the door
opened and Stephen stood before her, wild-eyed and pale with a pallor
which was like that of death. She sat quite still for an instant,
unable to speak, unable to express what she felt at the dreadful change
in his appearance.

But when she rose very softly and held out a hand to him, she
discovered, to her horror, that he still stared blankly in front of
him, making no sign. He did not see her.

Stephen, said she, in a low voice.

He started, and for the first time knew that he was not alone.

Annie! he said apathetically. It is you, is it?

With mechanical courtesy, he moved forward feebly and offered her a
chair; but she took his hand and led him very gently to the hard little
sofa, and made him sit down beside her there. She thought the feeling
which had evidently overmastered him must be remorse for his conduct
toward her and her husband, and she tried to think of the sweetest
words she could to soothe his distress.

It makes me very unhappy to see how deeply you are suffering, said
she. If I had known you would feel it so much, I would have come
before.

He played idly with his crutch, not in the least moved by her words.

It would have made no difference, said he, in a dull, cold tone.

Oh, but I think it would! I would not have let you think so much about
it!

How could you help that? said he, turning upon her his lusterless
eyes. I tell you I was not rich enough, and she would have thrown me
over just the same!

Annie started. He was thinking no more of the wrong he had done her
than if it had been a deed of a hundred years back. But she was not
angry. Her pity rose higher than ever for this unhappy man, who had
sacrificed all, even to his honesty, for the sake of a woman who did
not care a straw for him now that she had got from him all he had to
give.

Stephen, I am so very, very sorry for you, said she, in a quivering
voice.

Are you? said he, waking for an instant into something more like
life. And yet--you have no reason to be.

A feeling of shame seemed for the first time to come over him as he
realized whose sympathy it was that was offered him; and he drew his
hand away from hers.

Every one has reason to be sorry for any one else who is unhappy,
said she. And when you see that even I can feel sympathy with you, you
will see that you have friends who are worth living for yet.
