Write a brief outline of the following scene.


SCENE:
He was very anxious for Margot to come back.

When she came he could hardly wait for her to light the candles behind
him before he seized her hands and told her to sit down, he had
something particular to say to her, and he must say it at once, and she
mustnt get his supper till then.

Margot gave him a quick look, then she drew her chair near the bed and
laid her hand on his pulse.

No, Margot, dont. Im not the least excited, Jean said impatiently.

Margot withdrew her hand; she had felt his pulse flying under her
fingers.

I have been thinking things over, Margot, since I have been lying
here, Jean began, fixing her with his brilliant feverish eyes.

I have come to a great decision. I am going to make a change in my
life. I cannot be satisfied to earn money as I am earning it now, out
of the mere shell of what, to me, is indestructible life. I must get
nearer to the heart of things; why--youre laughing at me, Margot--but
I know you understand--these people who live in Paris cheat and talk
and play with sacred fire; I cannot belong to them, I must belong to
myself-- Jean paused for a moment; he tossed restlessly on his pillow.

But a man needs more than that, he went on at last. He must have
something to look forward to--something human and touching and
loving--a man must have a home!

Margot drew her breath a little quicker, but she saw she wasnt to
interrupt this list of a mans needs. Jean was evidently feverish
to-night; she must look into this directly he stopped talking.

Margot, come nearer to me. Give me both your hands, he said, his
eyes filled with tears; they were tears half of weakness and half of
pleasure; he was pleased at what he was going to do for Margot. She
gave him both her hands.

Have you thought, can you guess, who is to make my home for me? No!
Dont take away your hands, Margot-- He drew them to his lips and she
felt his kisses burn them. They have worked for me and nursed me,
these dear hands, he went on, breathless with sudden passion. Will
you let them stay with me always? Oh, your dear little, wonderful
womans hands, Margot; they are so small they make me cry; they are
so strong that I could worship them. Now, do you see what I meant? We
should be very poor, I know, but I could manage, Margot--and we should
live in the country, and we would sing and play all day long in the
blessed golden silence of Ucelles--say you will, say quickly you will
be my wife, Margot. Yes! Yes! Yes!

Your wife, Jean? said Margot; all the colour left her face, her heart
leapt over against her side like a terrified bird; then it felt very
heavy.

Dear Margot! dont look so frightened, you are not afraid of me, are
you?

No! Im not afraid of you! gasped Margot. It seemed to her as if a
thousand thoughts were beating at the bar of her mind and could not
get through. Why did Jean ask this of her? Would it be good for him?
Did he really need a quiet, simple life? Could she make him happy that
way? But all these questions suddenly seemed to resolve into one. What
had made him ask her that question? Her heart rebelled against this
stern catechism. Ah, why could she not take her joy when it came to
her? It had come at last--for a moment she let the taste of it fill her
whole consciousness, but she did not let Jean see that she had done
so; she kept her eyes down and no one knew what Margot looked like
when she held her hearts desire. Then she lifted them and looked into
Jeans eyes as Jean had never seen her look before; it was the terrible
implacable look of a human being seeking for truth. She looked into
Jeans eyes, and he felt her passing beyond all his careful plans,
beyond his excited momentary feelings, his tender regard for her, and
his ineffectual gratitude, into his very soul.

Dont look at me like that, Margot, he said quickly. Then he tried to
baffle her inflexible honesty. Dont you love me, Margot?

He almost smiled as he asked it; he was so sure of her great love.

Not in that way, Jean, said Margot firmly and with absolute finality.
And as she spoke she drew back a little, and took away her trembling,
fluttering hands. Jean stared at her; it seemed to him as if solid
earth had failed, as if something that was his by an inalienable right
had been taken away.

He felt not angry so much as incredulous and blank. How could she
possibly not love him? And how very lonely it made him feel!

Margot stooped down to pick up his letter that had fallen to the floor.
