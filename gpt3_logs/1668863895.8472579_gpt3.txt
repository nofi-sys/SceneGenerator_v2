SCENE:
VI.


When Skeltons arrival was known it made a tremendous sensation. Mrs.
Blair turned a beautiful rosy red when Blair brought the news home. At
thirty-five she was still girlish-looking, and her dark eyes were as
bright as ever.

Ah, my girl, cried Blair, with his offhand tenderness, Skelton has
never forgiven me for getting ahead of him with you; but if he had got
ahead of me--why, damme, Id have broken his neck for him long before
this!

Sylvia Shapleigh felt a little ashamed, as she always did at the
mention, or even the mere thought, of Skelton--she had been such
a very, very great fool! and she had a lively apprehension of her
mothers course upon the occasion, which was fully justified by events.

Mr. Shapleigh, began Mrs. Shapleigh one evening, the very first week
after Skeltons arrival at Deerchase, you will have to go and call
upon Richard Skelton, for it would break my heart if I did not see some
of those elegant things he has brought home in that pile of boxes that
came up from the wharf to-day.

Certainly, my love, I shall call to see him. As his former guardian,
I feel it incumbent; but, really, the fellow always interested me, for
all his confounded supercilious airs.

Well, Mr. Shapleigh, you seem to have altogether forgotten his
treatment of Sylvia; and that English wife of his put it out of his
power to marry again, just to spite my poor child.

Luckily Sylvia was out of the room during this; but just then she
entered, with a book in her hand, and seated herself at the round
mahogany table in the corner of the room, upon which a tall lamp burned
with shaded softness. Mrs. Shapleigh wisely dropped that branch of the
subject when Sylvia appeared.

Anyhow, Mr. Shapleigh, resumed Mrs. Shapleigh, we shall be obliged
to ask Richard Skelton to dinner. We cant get out of _that_.

Very well, my darling love, we will have Skelton to dinner.

But, Mr. Shapleigh, how can we possibly have Richard Skelton to
dinner, when he is accustomed to so much elegance abroad? And although
we live as well as any people in the county, yet it is nothing to what
he will have at Deerchase.

Then, my life, we wont have Skelton to dinner.

Now, Mr. Shapleigh, how you talk! You contradict yourself at every
other word.--Sylvia, what have you to say on the subject? I declare,
you read so much you dont know anything. The simplest thing seems to
puzzle you.

Not at all, mamma! cried Sylvia, with spirit, and bringing her book
together with a clap. Have Mr. Skelton to dinner, by all means--just
as we would have the Blairs, or any other of the neighbours. I dont
care a fig for his elegance. We are just as good as the Skeltons any
day; and any one of us--papa, or you, or I--is twice as good-looking as
Mr. Skelton.

Sylvia was fond of disparaging Skelton both to herself and to other
people.

Sylvia! Sylvia, my child! screamed Mrs. Shapleigh; your vanity is
very unladylike, and, besides, it is sinful, too. Nobody ever heard
_me_ say such a thing, although I had a much greater reputation for
good looks than you ever had. But if my glass pleased me, _I_ never
said anything.

You very seldom say anything, my love, remarked old Tom, quite
gravely.

Well, Mr. Shapleigh, I hope the next time you get married you will
marry a loquacious woman, and then, perhaps, youll long for your poor,
dear, humble Belinda. But to get back to the dinner. Of course, we must
have everything just as nearly like the way they have it at Deerchase
as possible, although how on earth we can have things the least like
they do at Deerchase, even if I put out every piece of glass and
silver I have in the world, is more than I can tell. But whom shall we
ask? That queer person that Richard Skelton brought home to write his
book--Mr. Bulstrode?

Yes, by all means, cried old Tom, grinning. He looks to me likely to
be an ornament to society.

And Mr. and Mrs. Blair?

Exactly, my love. Blair and Skelton hate each other like the devil;
and Mrs. Blair jilted Skelton, and I daresay has been sorry for it ever
since. Oh, yes, well have the Blairs, madam.
