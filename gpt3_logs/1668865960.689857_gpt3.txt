SCENE:
I can look after myself, Dicky remarked huffily.

Im only telling you what Granny said, Arthur stated. Apparently
Granny had put other responsibilities on him because he went on. I
know you swim in deep water, Rosie, because Ive seen you, and you too
Harold. But how about you Laura?

Well--Ill show you, Laura promised caustically.

Youll have to, Arthur told her, before Ill let you go over your
head. He turned to Maida. How about you?

Im not a fast swimmer nor a strong one, Maida declared, but I am
quite accustomed to deep water. I used to go over the side of the yacht
with father every morning in the Mediterranean, and I can swim forever
without getting tired out.

All right, Arthur said. And then, All in thats going in! he
shouted suddenly as the jetty came in sight. He burst into a run and
the file of children raced after him. Over into the water they went in
five tempestuous dives. Only Dicky remained watching them. They came
up almost simultaneously. Arthur and Harold, as a matter of natatorial
compliment, threw into each others faces the mud and weeds they had
brought up in their hands. Then they all struck for the middle of the
Pond. They swam with varying degrees of speed--Arthur first as became
his superior size and strength, his superior skill at all things.
Curiously enough Laura, who cut through the water like a thrown knife,
kept a close second to him. The others struggled behind, Maida always
in the rear.

They turned over and stared into the shining sky.

Now tell us a story Maida! Rosie said.

Maida began obediently. Once upon a time, she said to the
accompaniment of five pairs of hands beating the water, there lived
a little girl by the name of Rosie. She was probably the naughtiest
little girl in the world--

How about Silva Burle? Rosie interrupted quickly. You forget her.

Ill tell you what you _do_ forget, Laura took it up, poor Dicky
standing there all alone on the pier.

Gee, was all Arthur said, but he turned and swam back, the rest
following him.

Im going to give you your first swimming lesson now, Arthur called
to the disconsolate figure watching them. Arthur swam in shore. He
commanded Dicky to wade into the pond up to his waist.

Now, he said, putting one hand under Dickys chin, drop down slowly
until youre lying flat on the water. Ill hold you by the chin and by
your bathing suit in the back. Now listen! Youre to do exactly what I
tell you. Youll think Im going to drop you but I cross my throat I
wont. But you see that you follow my directions.

In a few minutes Dicky was paddling frantically, his eyes almost
bulging out of his head, his lips pursed together; his waving arms and
kicking feet beating the water almost to a lather. Breathe the way
you always do! Arthur was shouting. You poor fish, open your mouth.
Suppose you do swallow some water. It wont hurt you. Havent you ever
drunk any water in your life? Dont kick up and down. Make your legs go
the way a frogs does. Dont go so _fast_. Now Ill count for you. One!
Two! Three! Four! Breathe, you poor prune! How do you expect youre
going to swim without any breath in your body?

The others paddled about, adding their jeers or suggestions; but at
times they frequently deserted for a longer swim. Laura displayed a
number of water tricks--she was as graceful in her swimming as in her
dancing and for a short dash she could go fast. She dove forward,
sideways, and backwards. She sat upright in the water. She turned over
and over in a somersault. Her strength was nothing to that of Rosies
however, who seemed never to tire of any physical exercise.

That will be enough for to-day, Dicky, Arthur decided finally. Now
put on these water wings and practice the way Ive been telling you.
Breathe the way you always do and dont go too fast. Dont go into deep
water yet. If the wings should fall off or bust--

Burst! corrected Rosie promptly.

Collapse, Arthur substituted with unexpected elegance, youll sink
like a stone.

Ill stay near the shore, Dicky promised docilely. You bet, he
added, I dont want to make a hole in the water.

Shaking off his pedagogical duties, Arthur set off alone for the
middle of the Pond, swimming with the long powerful strokes which
characterized him, his head almost under water.
