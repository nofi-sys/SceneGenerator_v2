SCENE:
ANNE had taken off her costume and slipped into a neglige to do her
packing comfortably, and then decided she had better bid good-by to
Joe first. Bidding good-by was not an obligation between them, but
she had to get the key of his trunk--it was going back to New York
with hers--and her heart in its new warmth yearned to him, her only
relation. She wanted to tell him her great secret, see an answering
joy leap into his face, for he thought more of Bassett than anybody,
and hed be so surprised to hear that Anne, her charms held at a low
valuation, had won such a prize.

Her room was the first on the left side of the gallery, Joes next to
Sybils on the land front of the house. She passed the long line of
closed doors, voices coming from behind Mrs. Cornells, and reaching
Joes, knocked. A Come in, uninvitingly loud and harsh, answered her
and she entered. Joe was sitting in a low armchair, bent forward, his
hands holding a cane with which he was tapping on the floor. The bright
square of the window was behind him, framing rosy sky and the green
shore-line. He looked up to see who it was; then, without greeting or
comment, drooped his head and went on lightly striking the cane on
the carpet as if he were hammering in a nail and it required all his
attention. Anne felt dashed, his manner might have been the same to
an intruding stranger. She asked about the key, and he nodded to the
bureau where it lay. The trunk was packed and locked? To that he gave
an assenting grunt, then raised his head and looked at her--what have
you come here for, the look said.

It was not a reception to encourage confidences and she stood
uncomfortably regarding him, trying to find something to say that would
dispel his somber ill humor.

Youre all ready? Wheres your luggage?

Down by the door. Is there anything else you want to know?

_I_ dont want to know, I was thinking of you. Youre always late, and
its different here with only one way to get ashore and Gabriel never
willing to wait.

He made no answer, continuing his play with the cane. She knew that
something was wrong and sat down on the arm of a chair, uneasy,
wondering what it was:

Im glad youve managed this holiday. And its so jolly having Jimmy
Travers, hes such a sport. Youll meet him to-night at Bangor. At the
Algonquin Inn--wasnt that the name of it?

Um.

I want to be sure because if any important mail should come for you I
could send it there to meet you on your way back. Algonquin Inn--Ill
remember that. Then off to-morrow morning--itll be lovely in the woods
now.

Any place would be lovely after this beastly hole.

Beastly hole! I thought you liked it!

Did you? Take another guess.

You expected to like it. You wanted to come.

He made no answer, but slanting his body sidewise with an air of
ostentatious endurance, took out his watch and looked at it. She
ignored the hint--you couldnt be sensitive with Joe--and leaning
toward him asked:

Whats the matter, Joe?

Matter--with what?

You! Has anything happened?

Oh, no, nothings happened. His words were mincingly soft. What
_could_ happen with such a charming lot of people and Miss Saunders
playing the star rle in the performance and out.

It was Sybil then--hed been working himself into a bad temper over
her treatment of him. Anne had thought it odd he had not mentioned it
before:

Youre angry with Sybil, and I dont think she has been very nice
to you. Ive noticed it, especially the last three days and this
afternoon when we were sitting out there on the rock I tried to make
her tell me why.

He raised his head; the profile sharply defined against the window
showed a working muscle in the cheek: And did she tell you?

No, she didnt seem to want to talk about it. She changed the subject.
