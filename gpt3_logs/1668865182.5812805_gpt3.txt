SCENE:
Still the unhappy man did not understand the extent of his calamity. He
sat down again and passed his hand wearily through his hair.

What does it all mean? he muttered in a dazed manner. At all
events order the carriage and send for the best doctor in the town to
accompany me.

The doctor is here sir, replied the landlord, quickly, ready to
speak to you. Dr MColl, one of our most skilful practitioners.

Then he opened the door, and called out, Will you step up, doctor,
please, the gentleman is ready to see you, and in another minute
a middle-aged kindly-looking man entered the room and went up to
Walcherens side.

Doctor! said Frederick faintly, what is all this about? I dont
understand it. Have you seen my wife? Is she much hurt?

She is not suffering now, my dear sir, replied the doctor.

Thank God for that. But why did you not bring her home? I have been in
such awful suspense all the afternoon.

I am sure you must have been, but now I am going to take you to see
her. Here, Mr Cameron, a glass of brandy for Mr Walcheren. No! no soda
thanks. I want him to take it as it is.

He held the liquor to Fredericks lips, who drank it at a draught, and
put down the wine-glass with a deep sigh.

You must nerve yourself to hear what I have to tell you, said Dr
MColl firmly. I told you your wife no longer suffered, it is because
she has gone beyond the reach of suffering. She had been dead for hours
before the boatmen found her.

The young man sprung from his seat with the one word on his
lips--DEAD! He stared at his informant for a moment wildly, and then
sinking down on his chair again, threw his arms over his stricken face
and burst into a storm of tears.

Leave him alone, whispered the doctor to the landlord; they will
save his brain. But the next minute Frederick leapt up, and, seizing
Dr MColl by the arm, exclaimed,--

Take me to her. Dont let us lose a moment. Oh, my God! my darling, my
darling!

He tore down the staircase as he spoke, closely followed by the
landlord and the doctor. The waiters and chambermaids, who were hanging
about the passages discussing the awful event that had occurred, made
way respectfully for him as he appeared, and looked after the bereaved
bridegroom with melancholy interest. But Frederick might have passed
through the ranks of a regiment at that moment without perceiving them.
There was but one idea in his brain--to get as quickly as he could to
the side of his beloved. He had heard distinctly what the doctor said,
but he did not realise that Jenny was dead--that she would never speak
to him, nor smile at him, nor kiss him any more. The drive to the
public-house was performed in mournful silence, and when they reached
it they were at once taken through the bar to a back room, where on
a table was placed, just as she had been found, all that was left
of sweet Jenny Walcheren. Her chip hat, so fresh and pretty in the
morning, was still attached to her hair, by a long pin with a butterfly
at the end of it, but it was crushed and forced back upon her head by
the awful fall she had sustained. Her white dress had been decently
composed about her young limbs; she might have almost have deceived
one into the belief that she was sleeping, except for the purple lips
which were drawn off the white teeth, and a dark blue bruise over the
right eye, where her temple had struck the cruel rocks. But Frederick
saw nothing but that he had regained his wife, and falling on her body,
covered it with kisses, imploring her by every fond entreaty he could
frame, to open her eyes once more and look at him, and to unclose her
bruised and livid lips and speak his name. At last his madness calmed
down a little, leaving a dull despair behind it, when he turned to the
doctor and said,--

Tell me, for mercys sake, how did it happen?

We are as much in the dark as you are, my dear young friend, replied
Dr MColl, all we know is, that two Deal boatmen, Jackson and Barnes
by name, went to the lower beach after their boats, which are drawn up
there, at five this afternoon, and found the poor lady lying under the
cliffs, over which there is no doubt she must have fallen, but how,
there is nothing to tell. They did not know her name, so carried her
here and sent for me. But I could do nothing. She must have been dead
for two or three hours before I saw her. When I was convinced of that,
I set inquiries on foot, to find out who she was, and they soon led me
to the Castle Warden Hotel.

It wasnt easy to mistake her, interposed Mr Cameron, whose own eyes
were suspiciously red; the prettiest bride, as everyone says, we have
had in the hotel for the last twelve month.
