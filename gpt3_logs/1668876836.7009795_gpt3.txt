What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
Really? asked Bert, evidently not much impressed. Thats fine,
Baker. The second rather needed pitchers last spring.

Hes going out for the first, said Jimmy. Duds like me, you know.
When Duty calls Jimmy smiled eloquently.

I say, though, Logan, who is this Johnnie you spoke of? Mathews,
wasnt it?

Not Johnnie; Christopher, replied Jimmy gravely. I referred to Mr.
Christopher Mathewson, better known as Matty, the Dean of American
Pitchers. Dud and Matty are as thick as thieves; that is, Dud is!
Dud reads everything Matty writes and can tell you off-hand how
many games Matty pitched last year and all the other years, and how
many he won, and what his averages are and all the rest of it. He has
a gallery of Mathewson pictures and hes the proud possessor of a
ball that Mathewson used in a game with Philadelphia back in 1760 or
thereabouts. I dont know how he got that ball, but I suspect that he
swiped it.

It was given to me, said Dud defensively. Then he added, embarrassed:
You mustnt mind what Jimmy says. He talks a lot of nonsense.

I say, though, exclaimed Hugh, I do hope you get on the first,
Baker. It must be a lot of fun to do the pitching, eh? More fun than
fielding, I fancy.

Have you pitched much? inquired Bert politely.

Ive been trying to for a couple of years, answered Dud. I dont
suppose Ill make the first this year, of course, but Murtha said hed
be glad to have me try, and so

You must make allowances for his modesty, said Jimmy. Hes really
rather a shark at it. He can tell you just how to pitch any ball ever
discovered, from a straight one to a floater.

Question is, I guess, Bert laughed, whether he can _pitch_ em. I
know _how_ to pitch a knuckle ball, but I cant do it. I remember
now, Baker, you pitched some on the second last year, didnt you?

Only three games, or parts of them, Winslow. I dare say I wont be
good enough this year, butI thought Id try.

Of course, said Bert heartily. Nothing like trying. The trouble is,
though, youve got some good ones to stack up against, eh? Theres Nate
Leddy and Ben Myatt

And Gus Weston, observed Jimmy gravely.

Bert smiled. Just the same, Gus has pitched some good games for us.
But isnt he a wonder when he goes up?

Jimmy chuckled. Gus Weston can go up quicker and higher than any
fellow I ever saw, he said. And when he _is_ wild He ended with
an impressive whistle.

He looked pretty promising last spring, continued Bert. Remember the
game he pitched against Middleboro? They only got six hits off him, I
think.

Yes, and Kelly is another chap that is likely to make good this year,
said Jimmy. Oh, were pretty well off for twirlers, but you wait until
Dud gets going. And speaking of going, Dud, what do you say if we do a
little of it?

Dont rush off, said Bert. Well, come around again, Jimmy.

Probably the invitation was meant to include Dud, but Hugh thought that
Dud might not interpret it so and added cordially, Yes, do, fellows!

On the way downstairs Jimmy said: Well, we got out of that pretty
well, Dud. I thought for a while you were going to spoil everything by
monopolizing the conversation the way you did, but

I dont seem to know what to talk about, said Dud ruefully. I guess
Ordway thought me an awful ass.

Well, he rather pointedly invited you to come back, so I dont think
you need to worry about that. The next time

There wont be any next time, interrupted the other. Its just like
you said, Jimmy. I cant mix and theres no use trying.

Oh, yes, there is! Weve just started. That was thethe entering
wedge, so to say. Well drop around again next week. And between now
and then Ill put you through a course of sprouts, old chap. Well mix
in society. Just as soon as you can learn to forget your plaguey self,
Dud, youll get on finely. The trouble is with you that you just sit
and worry about what fellows are thinking of you. But Ill break you of
that quick enough.
