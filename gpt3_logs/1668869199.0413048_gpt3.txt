What is the narrative purpose of the following scene? What goals does the author achieve?


SCENE:
No, Hi said, Im afraid I dont.

What do you think of it?

Its very grand. Indeed it was very grand, being in two orders of
colossal architecture, carven to the cornice with grotesques of gods. It
seemed to Hi to be five cricket pitches long. It was built with a tough
stone facing over brick. Wherever trees had broken the facing, the brick
core was laid bare: they were small bricks laid in a mortar like melted
flint spread very thin. The bricks were rose-red and seemingly as tough
as stone. All the roof of this temple was covered with trees, shrubs,
plants and flowers, beautiful exceedingly. It occurred to Hi that this
was the sort of place for which Dudley Wigmore may have come
prospecting.

Ive had the men at work at this one for some time now, the man said.
Im getting it a bit clear now. Where do you suppose the treasure would
be?

I suppose the Spaniards got all the treasure at the conquest.

Not from this one: they never came near this one.

Ill bet they did, Hi said.

Well, I know they didnt, the man said. This place was lost in the
jungle centuries before the Spaniards came. I can prove it: look here.

He led Hi to the temple door, in front of which a great heart tree had
once grown. This tree had been sawn through and removed: the near-by
ground was all burnt and scattered with its wreck.

Theres the proof, the man said, that tree was blocking the main door
long before the Spaniards landed. Count the rings in the stump.

Thats true, Hi said, glancing at the countless rings. But dont
these tropical trees put on more than one ring in a year?

No, they dont, the man said. Whereabouts inside do you suppose the
treasure is?

I suppose under the altar, wherever that would be. But the people would
have taken it with them when they went from here.

They didnt go from here.

Hi waited: he knew that the man wanted his help in some way in this
treasure-hunt. He would not ask any question which might bring in or
suggest Wigmore. He was certain that Wigmore had discovered this place
and had been murdered because of it. Any knowledge which the man had was
Wigmores.

It will be hard work, Hi said, to get inside this place.

Nothing like the work of getting to it. The roof hasnt fallen.

Ill be surprised if it hasnt, Hi said, with the weight of the trees
growing on it.

The roof cant fall, the man said. These builders couldnt vault a
roof. That is why this place is so narrow. The roof is of slabs of stone
laid upon balks of stone. Its as strong as a hill. It is all enormous
walls, with narrow rooms inside them. Theres a certain amount of mess
inside, of course: these tropics sprout like sewage, but it can be
easily cleared: that is, fairly easily.

It would be interesting work, Hi said, to get inside and see what
its like.

Interesting? I believe you, the man said. This place was built by the
Quetzals, whoever they may have been. They had a picture writing of
sorts and kept a history in it. Theyve got rolls of their history in
Santa Barb; people have been deciphering it. Nothing much is known of
them yet, for they were gone before the Spaniards came. Now Ive reason
to believe that this place is the great temple of the Quetzals; the
Temple of the sun, or the Temple of Gold. It was a legend when the
Spaniards came, as I expect you know: they heard of it: they often
looked for it, but they never found it; the forest fever saw to that.
Except by a sort of miracle no one could have found it. The Quetzals
were a great race: youll see their cities up in Melchior; but the fever
came in and wiped them out. I believe that this old god-shop is bung
full of gold.

What gold? Hi asked.

Gold of offerings.

That would be exciting.

The Sacramento would be a fool to it.


PURPOSE OF THIS SCENE:

==========

The purpose of this scene is to introduce the idea of the lost city of the Quetzals, and to hint at the possibility that it is full of treasure. The author achieves this by having the man in the scene tell Hi about the history of the city and the legend of the Temple of Gold.
