SCENE:
Four miles.

Are there no horses nearer?

Not here. All went early this morning to the fiesta. At five or even at
six you might have had your pick of horses, but now there are none.

It occurred to Hi that, when he had paid for some drinks, the hostess
might be more helpful.

Ask her to serve some wine, Hi said. You deserve the best wine after
your morning.

The hostess was pleased to serve wine, but the order did not make her
more forthcoming about horses. Plainly there were none.

I must go on to the cross roads then, Hi said, if you will point out
the road. I will try for a horse there.

By his watch it was a quarter to two when he stepped across the bridge,
which led out of the village.

Nearly ten hours, he thought, since Rosa called me.

His track led uphill into the forest. Now best foot foremost, he said
to himself. Never mind the heat or anything else. Youve got to save
Carlotta and every minute is precious.

Very soon the trees closed over the road, so that he walked in the cool
twilight of a tunnel. He saw nothing remarkable for the first couple of
miles. Then he came upon a hare sitting upon its hind legs, seeming to
be praying, while a big snake sat opposite, swaying a little, making up
its mind to strike. Hi flung some stones at the snake, which ducked its
head and turned towards him with an ugly raising of the crest. With a
few more stones he drove it away. He then walked to the hare and stroked
it and spoke to it. Its fur was sick and staring. Presently it fell over
on one side, recovered and went shambling away.

What an ass my father is, Hi thought. He knew that I might meet
things like this, yet said that I should never need a revolver. I shall
need one twenty times a day. If I came on one of these snakes asleep, I
should never see it until I trod on it. I had better have a stick.

Unfortunately there was no stick nearer than forty feet from the ground.
He was in a place which grew nothing but feathery thorn and gigantic
timber in a solitude which might have been thousands of miles from men.
Giving up the stick, he went on for half an hour without seeing a soul.
The only living things he saw, apart from the flies, were deer, moving
like shadows among the trees, and very bright things, which he supposed
to be parrots against the sky, when the sky showed. After he had walked
for an hour he saw a gleam of water below him; soon he came to a wooden
bridge at which some tracks converged. There had been a ford or drinking
place for cattle above the bridge. This was now a collection of pockets
of red mud full of little snakes: beyond the bridge were houses; a farm,
somewhat old and untidy, built of wood in need of paint, with stabling
beside and behind it. Nearer to the river were two very ramshackle sheds
or cottages of wood, which had once been tarred but were now
rust-coloured. Dirty bedding hung from the windows of these sheds. Over
the door of one of them was a tiling shingle on which someone had drawn
in tar, with his forefinger, the word

CAMAS

(with the final S reversed). To the left of these, well away from the
river, and on the other side of the road, was a trim, white, prosperous
looking house, with a tiled stable. A cornfield of red earth strewn with
the shocks of young maize, stretched uphill behind this house. A
fair-haired, blue-eyed white man was hoeing among these maize shocks,
although it was the heat of the day. He was a South German, who spoke a
little English. He said that it was fine vetter and that Hi might tank
Gott for such fine vetter. As for a horse, his brother had gone with the
horse to the fiesta, but the old frau in the house opposite might lend
her colt.

He was a friendly, helpful young man. He took Hi across the tracks to
the old untidy farm where everybody seemed to be asleep. Here, after
they had both knocked and called for some minutes, a negress appeared,
rubbing her eyes with her skirt. This girl took them through a darkness,
which stank, into a hot shuttered room, where she called several times
by whistling like a kite. When something between a snarl and a gurgle
answered to her call, she opened the southward shutters so that Hi could
see.

He found himself near the door of a bare room, the floor of which was
trodden earth. A table, with fragments of fruit upon it, stood against
one wall. Against the end wall, opposite the window, was a tall-backed
red chair or throne, in which an enormously fat old woman, swathed in
folds of black, sat blinking as she roused from sleep. She was mopping
her brow with the handkerchief which had kept the flies from her face
while she slept. Hi had the feeling that she lived and slept in the
chair. She had a book of hours upon her lap; its marker, hanging from a
red ribbon, dangled from her knee. She soon checked her gurglings: she
woke up with great completeness. A pair of sharp and very cold grey eyes
shone out of her vast pale face with that narrowed glimmer which made Hi
think of the snake.
