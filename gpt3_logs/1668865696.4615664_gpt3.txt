SCENE:
BASSETT was detailed to find Stokes and bring him to the library.
A summons from the director would have an air of informality which
might put Stokes off his guard. Rawson did not communicate this to his
messenger, but told Williams when they were alone. He had been watching
Stokes and thought the man showed signs of strain. That morning at the
beach Stokes manner and appearance had suggested a nerve tension which
might rise from anxiety about his wife, but might also be the result of
some knowledge he was struggling to withhold.

Bassett found Flora and Shine on the balcony and heard that Stokes had
gone to his room to try to get some sleep. He knocked on the door and
to a gruff Come in entered to find Stokes lying on the bed. He rose
quickly, exhibiting the same alacrity his wife had shown earlier in
the day.

Of course, he said. Im ready to come whenever they want me. In fact
Ive been lying here expecting it, going back over last evening, trying
to think of anything I may have overlooked that might help them.

There was a willing bruskness in his manner, an almost hearty readiness
to do what was asked of him that seemed not quite genuine, adopted,
perhaps, to hide the natural nervousness of a person in his position.
Seated in an easy chair before the two men, Bassett back of them by
the window noticed that his hands were restless, smoothing and pulling
at his clothes, settling his tie. Despite his disquiet he assumed an
attitude of expectant attention, gravely awaiting their will, his eyes
glancing from one face to the other. He might readily have been a
guilty man primed for attack, or an innocent one shaken by the untoward
circumstances in which he found himself.

Rawsons manner was friendly and reassuring. They wanted to get all
possible information on the movements of the company the evening
before. Last night the examinations had been cursory and fuller ones
were necessary. They would like to know just what he had done from the
time he entered the house to change his clothes to the time when he had
heard the shot.

He answered promptly with businesslike directness. Went to his room,
changed his clothes, laid on the bed resting for a while, then sat on
the balcony reading the paper.

While he was sitting there Miss Saunders must have passed the end of
the balcony by the path that led to the Point.

She must have, but he had not seen her, being occupied with his paper.

Had he while in the house seen Miss Saunders or heard her voice?

He had not. He had no idea she had come in.

Had he seen his wife?

My wife? Yes, I saw her for a moment. In the hall when I came out of
our room after dressing.

Did she tell you she was going to take a walk round the island?

Well, I hardly remember. He tilted his head sidewise with an air of
careful consideration. Yes, I believe she did say something about
it--its very vague in my mind. It made no impression on me. We
exchanged a few words and parted.

She said nothing to you about Miss Saunders being in the house?

Why no, she didnt know it. We didnt mention Miss Saunders at all.

But she was--she had been--a frequent subject of conversation between
you?

His eyes, looking at Rawson, seemed to harden and grow more fixed:

We _had_ talked of her--naturally being in the same company.

Your wife and Miss Saunders were not very friendly?

A fierce light rose in the fixed eyes, the nostrils widened.

What are you getting at, Mr. Rawson?

Our business, Mr. Stokes. Were here to investigate a murder and we
cant spare peoples feelings or shut our eyes to disagreeable facts.

Have I shown any signs of expecting that? Ive put myself at your
disposal, my wife has. Were ready to give you any help we can, but Im
not ready to back up any damned suspicions that have been put into your
mind.

Were not asking you to, said Rawson. But we know what was going on
here before the shooting.
