SCENE:
But its there all the time: I mean, what you really are is there, no
matter where you are, she interrupted.

Maybe so, but it dont come out other places. Youve got the key, Miss
Julie. Ive got the key to the door, but youve got the key to what I
am.

But for the most part they did not attempt to phrase it, accepting it
simply and easily. They had been cramped and terrified, constricted
into their smaller selves, by other people and by their own constrained
natures, and now this wider existence trembled into view: an existence
set free from fear, where they might be themselves and be happy; and
they seized upon it with avidity.

They almost never spoke of Elizabeth. Julie never did, and he but
rarely. My wifes gone out with Mrs. Johnson. Shes crazy about the
movies, he sometimes said. Once he said, I offered to go with her,
but she said I wasnt good enough company. Shed rather have anybodys
company but mine.

Well, if she leaves him every night like that, of course hes
lonesome, Julie thought sharply to herself.

They did not meet thus a great number of times--not more than six or
seven, all told. They wondered over the miracle of their friendship
and they rejoiced in the new life that it brought to them, yet they
spoke no word of love to each other. But there fell at last an evening
when the summer night had come down over Harts Run; when children
in pretty, clean frocks called to one another through the dusk; when
lovers would have walked the street, if it had not been a war year,
with most of the young men gone; when the whole village was relaxed
and at ease; and when Julie, sitting sewing by her light, heard the
key scrape in the lock, the creak of footsteps on the stairs, and in a
moment looking up saw Mr. Bixby before her, but with a face so strange
and pinched that she cried out, What is it? Whats happened?

He sat down in the rocker and looked at her for a dumb moment. Then he
spoke.

Its come; my draft calls come. I got to go.

You got to go? she whispered.

I just got it from the post office. I got to go in the mornin. Shes
out--my wifes out. I aint told her yet. I came to you, Miss Julie.

You--you got to go in the morning, she repeated blankly. Her work had
fallen in her lap, and the delicate folds were crumpled between her
clutched hands.

He nodded. I got to go. They drafted me.

Neither of them spoke for a moment. Julie swallowed spasmodically
once or twice, looking around the little room where their imprisoned
personalities had come together in the last weeks. Where they had found
one another, and in that finding had discovered their hidden selves.
Where their souls had ventured forth and found a whole new world
impinging marvelously upon their constricted everyday existence, and
where the timid and reserved room had taken on life from their life.

Youre going away? she faltered again, knowing that this world was
falling to pieces. She felt herself beginning to tremble all over.

I got to go, honey, he said, and stretched out his hand open to
her across the table. It was the first time he had used a term of
endearment--the first time he had stretched his hand to her. She
put her own swiftly into his. The two hands, small and thin, locked
together there upon the table. She did not look at him, she looked down
at their clasped hands in the light--hands that had miraculously found
each other out of all the tumult and terrors of life. Through the tears
that were beginning to burn into her eyes the hands looked dim and
uncertain. The trembling of her body ran down her arm into her fingers,
and communicated itself to his. A tremor shivered through their hands
as they clung together.

I--I _got_ to go, aint I, little honey?

There was a question in his tone now, and she looked up swiftly into
his face, the tears arrested and hanging upon her lashes. In his eyes
looking hungrily at her she read hesitation and dread. She forgot
herself in the realization of what was before him.

Youre afraid, she said abruptly.

His face flared darkly red, and he put his disengaged hand up before
his eyes. But in a moment he took it down and looked straight at her.

Yes, I am, he said. Look at me, honey, I dont mind your knowin it.
I _want_ for you to know. I want you to know just all I am. Youre the
only person in all the world I could ever speak about it to, but I want
you to know just the onery little feller I am. Youre my mother, an my
sister--youre what I am. I cant keep nothing back from you. I want to
lay my heart right out for you to see.
