SCENE:
XI
THE FIRE

Again has come the Springtime, with the Crocuss golden bloom,
With the sound of the fresh-turned earth-mould and the violets
perfume.
Samuel Longfellow.


It is the spring of Lissas second year in her Nebraska home. Nathan,
through with his winter duties at the post, has become farmer again, and
the prairie, yet gray with the tall wild grass of the previous year, is
black-dotted with patches of newly plowed land, while the upspringing
verdure gives the landscape a gray-green tint of great beauty.

Lissa has grown to love this Western home, and as we see her now,
tripping about the floor of her humble cabin, there is a maturer look in
her bright face and pliant figure, and though she is paler in cheek and
lip, her smile speaks the joy in her heart. Her neat calico gown is
supplemented by a white cambric apron, and as she critically glances
about her she is a picture of womanly contentment. She is obliged to
make up in swiftness now the time demanded from her work to care for the
little seraph who kicks, squirms, and even cries in her waking hours if
she is not given immediate and undivided attention. Their house has
grown with their family, and a nice little lean-to has been built,
giving an extra room, and Lissa seems to have forgotten to wish for the
spacious walls or wide balconies of her former home. She has as good as
her neighbors, and luxuries are only comparative, after all. It must be
confessed, Lissa is not a little vain of the handsome silver, few pieces
of cut-glass, and dainty napery which were among her wedding gifts, and
which she can now display on occasions to the admiration and envy of her
less fortunate neighbors. Only Alice, of all her neighborhood, can
outshine her in this, but Mark is an army officer, and quite the great
man of the place, and she cannot feel envious of one of the family.

It is nearly dinner time and baby must be put aside while Lissa prepares
the table. A motherly solicitude shines in her dark eyes as she places
the little autocrat in her crib (a large wicker clothes-basket), puts in
her clutching, uncertain grasp the rubber ring, and turns toward her
work.

There, there, baby Lucy, lie still with your toys,
For papa is coming and does not like noise,

she sings, in her clear treble.

Hush, hush, theres a deary, or mamma ll be weary;
There, there, but a minute, youll have to be in it,
Till mamma makes dinner, then babys the winner.

Thus sings and rhymes the girl-mother, and the cloth is laid in a short
space of time, and few moments later the dignified, manly figure of
Nathan enters.

How smoky it is getting outside, Lissa says as she catches a glimpse
of the atmosphere through the open doorway.

Yes, the fires must be making considerable headway across the river.
The smoke is much denser than it was this morning when I began plowing.

You think it is all across the river? No danger of its getting over
here? Lissa questions, a note of anxiety in her voice.

O, no; the river ll protect us. I should think Linkwell and Jordan,
over there, would need to start back fires, though.

Weve been fortunate, this spring, not to have any started on this
side, Lissa says.

Yes, with as much tall, dry grass as there is about. We dont generally
have any fear of fires at this time of year. Its the fall when they
rage worst. The spring burning is unusual, continues Nathan in his
measured speech. But I suppose some one thought hed burn off his piece
of ground before plowing, and was careless about it, as we were once
upon a time. His plowed strip may have been too narrow, or the wind too
high.

Oh, one cannot be too careful! Lissa says with feeling. I think what
a close call we had when you let me fire the ten-acre lot by the canon,
and all because the sod was not quite overturned on that rocky place at
one corner.

Yes, but I reckon it was a good thing to happen. You wouldnt have
known how to fight a fire if we had not had that experience. Now if one
should start up you would know what to do.

Yes, she says reflectively.

The meal ended, Nathan goes again to his work, which is now upon the
upper end of the farm, nearly two miles from the house, and Lissa, when
the dinner-work is over, sits down to rock her baby to sleep.
