SCENE:
Surely, Donna Emilia said, a vengeance of Heaven will fall upon a man
like that.

Our Caligula will not long survive his decree, Don Inocencio said.
Our old days of the Blancos will begin again.

What will people do? Hi asked.

They will do much, Don Inocencio said. For a beginning, the priests
are already leading their young men to tear down these placards. In the
New Town, a priest known to me was gathering the fraternity of his
parish as I passed by on my way here. The week will see Don Lopez out of
his palace.

I wonder, Rosa said.

Wonder what, dear? her mother asked.

Whether this follows on what Chacon told me half an hour ago. The
Hinestrosa creature escaped in some way. The Reds must know by this time
that the Whites are planning something. This is their counter-stroke.

Let us at least be thankful that General Chavez must be in the city by
this time.

I think he must be, Don Inocencio said. Perhaps it is too early for
General Chavez to be here, or indeed to be already on his way, but
preparing to be on his way, that, yes, we might declare with confidence.
Undoubtedly, he is preparing to be on his way, to, how shall we put it?
to draw the sword of outraged religion.

Thank God that we may think that, Donna Emilia said. We know, that
however indolent Luis may be, he is great enough to overcome his
indolence when his country calls.

I dont think so, mother, Rosa said. I dont think he is. His country
has called ever since the last election. What has he done? He has been
at home distilling liqueurs and trying to grow Pommard grapes.

And why not? Don Inocencio said. Thus the great Roman patriots were
employed when their country cried to them. They were on their farms,
pruning their vines, or binding faggots, as I think Horace puts it,
at the bidding of a Sabine grandmother. But when their country called,
they arose; exchanging, as someone says, the service of the rustic god,
whose name I forget, for that of Mars. Besides, Luis Chavez is a
soldier. He needs the opportunities of the soldier, attack or defence,
rather than those of the debater and intriguer.

I do not think that he is a soldier any more than he is a statesman,
Rosa said. He is a self-indulgent, indolent country gentleman, who
loves his garden and his book.

I have known Luis Chavez for a great many years, Rosa, her mother
said. You are not just to him. He is a good man. If he be not hasty, it
is because he is wise. He weighs situations before he decides. He asks
Gods direction before he acts. I think that we ought all now to pray
that he may be directed to act wisely now.

Before we do that, mother, Rosa said, we really ought to send into
the town for Carlotta. She has not yet returned. There is a good deal of
noise in the town; listen to that. There may be rioting or shooting.

Let me go, Hi said.

I thought I heard the horses, Donna Emilia said.

There are no horses.

There is a noise though, Hi said. There is shouting. Someone is
shouting and coming along the road.

Rosa was sitting beside Hi. She clutched his arm as though she wished to
crush it. He felt her tremble or thrill like a taut guy suddenly
stricken.

Hi, she whispered, is it rioters in the road, mobbing her?

No, no, Hi said, it sounds like a man crying news.

Listen, Don Inocencio said.

It is only one voice, Hi said.

Yes, it is only one voice.

Have you town-criers here? Hi asked.

It is a newspaper seller crying some special edition, Don Inocencio
said. Pablo, the major domo appeared, with mat for Don Inocencio.
