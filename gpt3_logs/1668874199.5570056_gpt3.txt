SCENE:
XI


LARRY GOES CALLING

RUTH and Mrs. Flanders sat on the porch at Elkhorn Lodge and watched a
rider descend a hill trail toward the ranch. It was late in the season.
Except a hunting party, only a few stray boarders remained, and these
would soon take flight for the cities. But in spite of the almanac the
day had been hot. Even after sunset it was pleasant outdoors.

The rider announced his coming with song. For a fortnight he had been on
the round-up, working sixteen hours a day, and now that it was nearly
over he was entitled to sing. The words drifted down to the women on the
porch:

Foot in the stirrup and hand on the horn,
Best damned cowboy that ever was born.

Its Larry Silcott, announced Mrs. Flanders, brightening. She was a
born gossip. When the owner of the Open A N C was with her there was a
pair of them present.

Yes, assented Ruth. She had known for some moments that the
approaching rider was Larry.

He offered for their entertainment another selection.

Sift along, boys, dont ride so slow.
Havent got much time but a long round to go.
Quirt him on the shoulders and rake him down the hip,
Ill cut you toppy mounts, boys, now pair off and rip.

After a few moments of silence the wind brought more song to the women
on the porch:

Bunch the herd at the old meet,
Then beat em on the tail;
Whip em up and down the side
And hit the shortest trail.

The young man appeared to catch sight of the women and waved his
pinched-in felt hat at them, finishing his range ditty with a cowboy
cheer for a rider to the last stanza:

Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya youpy ya,
Coma ti yi youpy, youpy ya.

He cantered up to the ranch, flung himself from the saddle without
touching the stirrups, grounded the reins, and came forward to the porch
with jingling spurs. Ruth did not deny that he was a most engaging
youth. The outdoor bloom on his cheeks, the sparkle in his eyes, the
nonchalant pose that had just a touch of boyish swagger, all carried
their appeal even with women old enough to be his mother.

Is the round-up finished? asked Mrs. Flanders.

Theyve got to comb Eagle Creek yet and the Flat Tops. He fell into
the drawl of the old cowman. But Im plumb fed up with the dust of the
drag driver. Me, Im through. Enoughs plenty. The boys can finish
without Larry Silcott.

Oh, Im going home
Bullwhacking for to spurn,
I aint got a nickel,
And I dont give a dern.

You seem to have quite an attack of doggerel to-night, suggested Ruth.

Doggerel nothing. Every one of em is a range classic. I got them from
old Sam Yerby, who brought them up from Texas. Ive been giving you the
genuwine, blown-in-the-bottle ballads of the man who wears leathers,
defended Larry.

Who is boss of the round-up this year? asked Mrs. Flanders.

Rowan is, and believe me he worked us to a fare-you-well. Hes some
driver, Mac is; one of your sixty-horsepower dynamos on two legs. He is
good for twenty-four hours a day himself, and he figures the rest of us
are made of leather and steel, too. Im a wreck.

Whats that I hear about Falkner and Tait having some more trouble?

Trouble is right, Mrs. Flanders. They met over by the creek at Three
Willows. One thing led to another, and they both got down from their
horses and mixed it. Tait had one of his herders with him, and he took a
hand in the fracas. The two of them gave Falkner an awful beating. He
was just able to crawl to his horse.

Tait ought to be driven out of the country, pronounced Mrs. Flanders
indignantly. Hes always making trouble.
