Write a concise summary of the following scene:


SCENE:
-----

[5] It was a matter of pride among the desperadoes of Nevada in early
days to be cock of the walk. Many a bad man died with his boots on
because he aspired to be chief among his fellows. So long as these
ruffians killed each other, the community paid little attention to their
murders. When good citizens fell victim, a sentiment was created which
eventually resulted in the supremacy of law.W. M. R.

A faint trickle of smoke still issued from the barrel of his revolver as
he thrust it back into its scabbard, where it could be seen beneath the
flapping coat tails. He disappeared into the Mile High and proceeded to
down half-a-dozen gin slings at the expense of friends who did not dare
withhold this tribute of admiration lest he make one of them number
eleven on his list. An hour later, Scot McClintock saw him there, in
drunken slumber lying on a billiard table, the brute primordial, first
among the bad men of the lawless camp because he was its most deadly
ruffian. There were those who would have liked to make an end of him as
he lay soddenly asleep, but he was so quick and terrible that their fear
was greater than the lust to kill.

Scot helped from the ground the woman he had thrown. She looked at him,
her breast rising and falling deep, fear still quick in the soft brown
eyes. Her cheeks were white as the snow on Mt. Davidson.

Madam, Im sorry I was rough, Scot said, and gave her the most gallant
bow in Washoe. But you were in the line of fire. I couldnt take
chances.

Emotion shook her. A faint colour crept timidly into her face. She said,
in a voice hardly audible: You saved my life.

I wouldnt go that far, the man answered, smiling.

Something eager, beautiful, made of the womans eyes soft stars of
night. Ill never forgetnever, she promised, with a strangled sob.

There was a low jangling laugh at her shoulder. Thas right. Always a
fool if you can find a chance to be one, Moll, a voice sneered.

The light died from the womans eyes, the colour from her cheeks. She
became at once a creature lifeless, without spirit.

Scot turned, voice soft and suave. Did you find what you went to look
for in the wagon, sir? he asked, raking the unkempt unclean emigrant
with scornful eyes.

A dull flush burned into the mans face. A furtive darting look slid
from the yellow-gray eyes. It carried menace, as does sometimes that of
a tamed wolf toward its trainer.

II didnt notice where Moll was when I started, he said with sullen
reluctance. An I reckon thas _my_ business.

Quite so, agreed the gambler.

He bowed again to the woman in the cheap patched homespun, met the eyes
of his brother, and turned to go.

From the wagon came a weak little wail. The McClintocks stood rooted in
their tracks. Again the puling cry was raised. With a murmured
exclamation the woman excused herself hurriedly and climbed into the
covered wagon.

Have you got a baby there? asked Scot, a new note in his voice.

The father grunted a sulky Yes.

A baby, Hugh. An honest-to-God baby. The first in Virginia City. What
do you think about that?

Could we see it, do you reckon? the younger brother asked eagerly.

Scot turned on him reproving eyes. Im surprised at you, Hugh. That
babys beingfedright now. Suddenly he wheeled on the emigrant. Boy
or girl?

Girl!

Great. Well call her Virginia.

Her names Susan, the father growled.

No matter. Well change it. Last name?

Dodson. Her names goin to stay right what it is now.

A crowd of men had poured upon the vacant lot to view the scene of the
killing. Some were removing the body to an adjacent saloon, others were
discussing the affair guardedly from its dramatic and not from its
ethical standpoint. There was no question of ethics in an ordinary
killing if both combatants had had ample warning. It was the boast of
Virginia, just as it was later of Austin, Pioche, Aurora, and the other
Nevada camps, that it had a man for breakfast each day. This was not
the literal truth, but it was too nearly true for comfort. The diggings
were infested with wild, lawless criminals driven from more settled
communities. They robbed stages, held up citizens, and maintained the
rule of the six-gun among communities the great majority of whose
residents would much have preferred peace and order.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

In early days in Nevada, it was a matter of pride among the desperadoes to be cock of the walk. Many a bad man died with his boots on because he aspired to be chief among his fellows. The community paid little attention to their murders as long as they killed each other. When good citizens fell victim, a sentiment was created which eventually resulted in the supremacy of law.
