SCENE:
XIV

MAROONED!


Gone! exclaimed Hugh. My word! But how

Cut out the comedy, Jimmy, said Nick. Arent they there, really?

Well, you come and have a look. Maybe your sight is better than mine.
I havent my glasses with me and so, of course, I may be mistaken, but
nevertheless and notwithstanding

Well, Ill be switched! muttered Nick, holding a flaring match aloft
in the darkness. Now how the dickens

I guess, offered Dud, that getting in and out of them to drink
pushed them off.

Thats the jolly story, agreed Hugh. But they were there the last
time I went down.

Who took the last drink? asked Jimmy.

You did, didnt you? Did you see both canoes then?

Jimmy turned to Nick in the gloom and considered. At last: I didnt
notice, he confessed. It was pretty dark then

But I say, interrupted Hugh, what are we going to do, eh?

Beat it home, Ighness, responded Nick, if you know what I mean.
Theres no use looking for the pesky things tonight. I dare say,
anyway, theyll run aground somewhere before they get very far. What
weve got to do is foot it back. How far is it, Jimmy?

About a mile and a half, answered Jimmy gloomily, and most of the
way across this plaguey marsh. Unless we strike across that direction
and find the Yarrow road.

That would be worse than looking for the canoes, said Nick. Best
thing to do is follow the river as well as we can. Come on!

I say, if I fall in you might sing out so Ill know which way to
swim, suggested Hugh. Tomorrow Im going to buy an anchor for that
canoe, Nick; that is, if I ever find it.

Gee! muttered Jimmy.

Whats the matter? asked Nick.

I was just recalling the interesting fact that the canoe we were in
belongs to young Twining, the little beast, and he will be likely to be
quite peevish if its lost.

How inconsiderate! laughed Nick. Hes a junior, isnt he?

Yes.

Thats all right then. You can point out to him that its a great
honor for him to have his canoe lost by an upper middler. Besides,
itll turn up in the morning. Oh, thunder!

I should say so! agreed Hugh, scrambling out of the ditch he had
followed Nick into. Ware water, fellows!

Dud and Jimmy escaped that time, but during the next half-hour or so
they had their share of misfortunes. There was no moon and the stars
were partly hidden by light clouds and it was impossible to see more
than a pace ahead at any time. They never actually tumbled into the
river, but they frequently stumbled down the bank and only saved
themselves by prompt laying hold of whatever they could reach, as when
Nick, walking too close to the edge and finding himself slipping,
promptly clutched Hughs leg and nearly doubled the catastrophe! It
seemed more like an hour than a half-hour since they had left the
willows before they caught sight of the old bridge looming indistinctly
above them. After that the rest was easy, for they had only to break
their way through the bushes that clad the embankment and foot it along
Crumbie Street to the corner of the campus, their path now illumined
by the infrequent street lights. Under the first of them they stopped
to take stock. Every one of them was wet to the knees or above and
plastered here and there with the nice, dark, rich mud of the marshes.
It was almost eight oclock and any hope they may have entertained of
reaching their various rooms undetected had long since vanished. Nick
sighed philosophically as he turned to continue his journey, his shoes
_squish-squashing_ at every step.

Anyway, he said, when we tell them we lost the canoes and had to
walk home theyll just have to believe us! That is the one bright spot
in the surrounding gloom.


DETAILED SYNOPSIS:

==========

The scene opens with Hugh, Jimmy, and Nick discussing the disappearance of their canoes. They speculate that the canoes may have run aground somewhere, and decide to walk home. The journey is difficult, as they have to navigate a marsh in the dark. They eventually make it back to campus, wet and muddy. Nick philosophically notes that at least their story about losing the canoes will be believable.
