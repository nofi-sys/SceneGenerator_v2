SCENE:
III.

Prisoners of War.


After a night of fitful slumber, the captives were awakened early
by Dunton, the masters mate left in charge of the schooner when
Lieutenant Fotheringay went aboard the frigate. Dunton was a surly
fellow, over middle age, and heartily hating all Americans who, in his
opinion, were an inferior breed of English inhabiting a semi-civilized
land. To him they were damned Yanks, deserving of neither courtesy
nor favor.

Lively, you fellows; get ready to go aboard the frigate.

Hoppy coolly looked him over. I guess there aint much getting ready
about it, my friend. You see, we kind o forgot to bring our Sunday
clothes, not expecting this honor.

I dont want any back talk from prisoners, replied Dunton, sneeringly.

Is that so? asked Hoppy in an even voice, though inwardly he felt
like kicking the officer. Well, now, I should think youd like a
little chat, seeing youre so friendly about it.

Nice pair of scarecrows you are to go aboard a kings ship and meet a
post-captain!

This was intended to silence Hoppy. Hoppy flushed, and Captain Knowles,
seeing trouble ahead, nudged his compatriot warningly but without
effect.

Dont know as youre any beauty yourself, Dunton, with all your finery
in the way of brass buttons. Ignorant folks might take you to be the
king of England himself, but I have met kings officers before now and
I know that a masters mate of your stripe is no ornament to a ships
company.

Dunton was furious. Youll be sorry for those words yet, you damned
Yankee smuggler!

Maybe so, returned Hoppy. Im willing to take a chance, anyway.

There was some time to wait for the small boat to return from the
frigate, and from the deck of the schooner the prisoners had a fine
view of the splendid harbor of Provincetown, capable of affording
anchorage for a thousand sail, as was noted by Bradford when the
Mayflower first made the port. Many times had the captives sailed on
these waters and to them every depth and shallow was familiar. And
yet, notwithstanding the glorious summer morning, there seemed to be
the shadow of disaster over the scene. The town had suffered severely
from the presence of the enemys ships. Commerce was completely at a
standstill, for the great industry of the place, fishing, could not be
carried on under the muzzles of the British guns, and the few vessels
left in the port were rotting on the beach. The population was reduced
to a state of dumb submission to the invaders and, with the exception
of the British ships, the roadstead was a waste of waters.

About fifty yards from the schooner, the Spencer presented a sight
to gladden a sailors eye. Her towering masts and trim rigging showed
clearly against the sky. Her deck was a-swarm with busy men and her
burnished brasswork shone in the sunlight.

She certainly is a beauty, Hoppy, remarked Captain Knowles admiringly.

Yes, Win, she is surely that, replied Hoppy. No wonder Raggett is
proud of her.

Well, hes got about three hundred hands to keep busy and they have
nothing else to do but keep her tidied up. If there was a little more
fighting she mightnt look so pretty. Still, I dont think I should
like this navy life, myself.

Same here, Win. These Britishers have always had a navy and got
kind o used to the thing, but we have hardly started in. Maybe in
a few more years we shall have something besides a few cruisers and
privateers to meet them.

Soon after this the boat arrived and the prisoners were transferred to
the frigate.

Lieutenant Fotheringay, courteous as ever, met them at the gangway.

Gentlemen, Captain Raggett desires your presence in his cabin.

Well, now, said Hoppy smilingly, Ill be hanged if its not a
pleasure to meet a gentleman once more, even if hes an enemy!

Thank you, Captain Mayo.
