Write a brief description of all characters in this scene.


SCENE:
Annie looked up with irrepressible surprise that he should recognize
it. She was so used to an audience who considered all music above the
level of Offenbach as a not unpleasant noise that her face beamed with
pleasure at his very simple remark.

I will play you another--my favorite, said she.

And, in her delight at being with an appreciative listener, she played
better than usual, and at the end looked up naively for his approval.
He gave it without stint; and she went on from these to other favorite
pieces, which she knew well enough to be able to talk at the same time.

You must lead an isolated life here, I should think, with no one to
talk to?

So I dont talk, said she, smiling; I run wild in the fields with
William.

Do you like the life?

Yes and--no. I like it when I dont think. I like walking so far and
running so fast and jumping over so many ditches that I am too tired at
night to do anything but long for bed-time.

But you cant pass all your life like that.

That is the worst of it. I hate the thought of coming back to
semi-civilization when I am too old for my savage pastimes.

You used to write a little, I think you told me. Have you given it up!

Quite. I could never make a great author now, and nothing less would
content me.

He smiled; there was something of the simplicity of a child about
this matron. To be a great author one had but to wish it and to be
unmarried. And he lingered about the piano a long time, discussing
authors and authorship, and now and then hazarding a remark made
expressly to bring the indignant fire into her eyes and some speech to
her pretty lips piquant in its severity.

At last Lilian could bear it no longer; she rose and, with heightened
color, and a dangerous light in her eyes, walked to the piano.

Wont you sing something, Annie?

Her sister-in-law at once complied, and, before she had finished the
first verse, Lilian had diverted the colonels attention from all but
herself. The song ended, Annie rose, and, her cheeks still flushed with
the excitement of playing her best, slipped into the cool conservatory,
murmuring the last words of her song still softly to herself. She had
not been there two minutes before George joined her.

You dont mind smoke, Annie, do you?

No; besides, I am going back into the drawing-room.

Dont go yet. It is much nicer out here. And Harry has a quarrelsome
fit on and would disgust you.

That instantly checked her steps. Harrys bursts of childish petulance
were among her greatest trials. She turned with an impatient sigh again
to the flowers.

You played beautifully to-night, much better than you ever play for
any of us.

Colonel Richardson understands music.

While we understand only drinking and fighting; that is what you mean,
isnt it?

Oh, no, it is not! You understand a great many things which I know
nothing about--how to tease a person to death, for instance, said she,
with weary petulance.

That is unkind, said George, quietly. Never mind; I wont reproach
you now, when you are tired and excited by your own playing.

She looked up at him with some surprise.

It is astonishing that such a boor as I should have noticed
that, isnt it, and that I should know the difference between the
half-mechanical playing of pretty tunes and music full of passion and
feeling, like that you gave Colonel Richardson to-night.

I did not know you liked music, said she, in a low, troubled voice.

You never took the trouble to inquire; did you? But even among the
semi-civilized--to quote some words I heard you use to-night--there
may be capabilities for something better, may there not?
